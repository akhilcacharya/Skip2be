30	okay so today we're gonna be doing a
1920	quick unboxing of the Microsoft reclusa
4859	keyboard now you can see here based on
6779	the cameraman zooming in on nothing but
8370	this that it is powered by Razer and it
10590	has raised their hyper response gaming
12960	key action with customizable gaming
15059	controls and profile management so what
17789	Microsoft is saying about this keyboard
19170	is that it contains an enhanced English
20880	140 layout and it is engineered for
23510	gaming which basically means yeah that's
25920	the powered by Razer part because Razer
27630	makes gaming peripherals and Microsoft
29580	makes office peripherals as far as I can
31920	tell mind you Microsoft has some newer
33930	stuff that's pretty cool for like gaming
35820	products too so here we go hyper if
38100	Blonsky action reduces key latency
39750	maximizing response you got profile
41280	management so you can create and store
42750	key mapping and macros for each game
44579	profile blue backlit keys for the light
46829	conditions great and then two gold
48750	plated USB ports too huh okay great
53070	alright and then over here we have
54870	customizable gaming controls with two
56840	360 degree jog dials one on each side
59910	for quick access during heated gameplay
62430	then you have four bumper keys two on
64890	either side of the keyboard with an easy
66240	reach of the standard gaming keys now I
69390	have to question how these are within
71760	reach of any sort of standard gaming key
73860	because as far as I know most standard
76860	gamers are using these so these are in
79409	reach oh my battery's low this is gonna
81240	fail ok so we have six hot keys one
83610	touch of a customize hotkey execute
85380	multiple keystrokes beating play so
86729	basically these are macro keys and I'm
88680	not gonna open the box you get because I
90390	can see that the battery is low and I'm
92009	gonna have to just like do a transition
93630	here or something and we're back so now
96540	we're gonna actually open the box there
99420	we go
100020	this is the unboxing part of the
102509	unboxing now that we've already had the
104460	product overview part of the unboxing so
107399	there goes the box and here comes the
110549	second box yeah okay so the first thing
114780	we find inside is CDs which we get out
120030	by doing this there we go
122369	so we have a Microsoft gaming keyboard
124500	with software Rekluse I don't even know
126600	what this is oh it's a manual so you
128669	should plug it into the USB port install
131430	the software
132550	figure the keyboard and awesome
135670	okay next we have the contents the
138460	getting stowed the getting started guide
139870	so you can reduce the risk of injury
142380	something about compliance with EU
144400	something okay reclusive gaming keyboard
146800	driver disk do not use this download the
149200	latest drivers from WWE users on calm
152230	I guess Microsoft would probably have
154120	the drivers hosted somewhere like on
155740	their site to it I'm not sure to be
159010	perfectly honest that's the thing about
160450	these hybrid products where it's like
161950	one company's branding but powered by
164470	some other company who did probably most
167560	of the design work it's like well like
170080	who supports it at that point I guess
171640	Microsoft oh this is nice it's all like
174040	it's all leathery and like rubbery
177010	leathery you can see I can actually like
178840	press it down that's kind of comfy I'm
181300	gonna have to try that out before the
182740	video is over it's well it's kind of a
184960	nice wrist wrap okay well that was fun
187420	okay now let's get to the recluse a
189760	keyboard itself so this take special
202989	note of the no choke do not let your
205750	baby take this bag put it over its head
207730	and then throw so throw away the baby or
209950	that oh no they're telling you throw
211330	away the bag so that the baby doesn't
214209	get it okay awesome so we can peel off
217209	this so that's very shiny okay you can
220540	see we have the usual shine shot so you
222760	can see how shiny the top of the
224080	keyboard is it's a very weird shape this
226540	keyboard actually maybe it'll look a
228220	little bit better once we put the wrist
231280	rest on but it's like a very like it
233260	seems very oval compared to a normal
236170	keyboard which would seem more Square
237880	and another thing that I notice about it
239500	it's not it's really heavy compared to
242350	most new keyboards which is kind of it's
244570	kind of nice because it has that quality
246520	feel oh here's a feature that I didn't
248260	know it had check this out you have
250600	cable routing like cable management
252600	ports all along the bottom of the
254920	keyboard so you can route a bunch of
256930	different cables anywhere you want them
258488	to go you looks like you can even take
260019	out these little routing brackets here
261700	but that prevents the keyboard from
263500	being propped up on the cable
264970	you flip it over that's kind of nice
266320	okay so we've attached the rest rest and
268450	oh this is stupid okay so this wrist
272050	wrist you see how it's symmetrical it
274330	would be perfect if my hand sat here
276580	when I was typing can anyone tell me
278620	what's wrong with this picture no good
280840	okay well I mean this is okay but you
282910	can see clearly here that my left wrist
284830	comes off of the off of the wrist rest
287110	which is too bad because it's very
288340	comfortable so here are all the basic
290530	features we have the what appears to be
292690	a volume dial here no that's not a
294850	volume dial I don't know what it is but
296260	is plus/minus there you can spin the
297730	dial okay then we have some pot keys
300070	here then we have those other keys here
302680	and then we have WASD this is all blue
305770	backlit when you plug it in it's a
307570	fairly standard layout and the keys
310740	there's a fair bit of travel on there a
312970	little bit stiff but I'd say overall
314410	they're quite comfortable to type on not
316090	too loud too which is nice if you're a
317620	late-night gamer and there are other
318850	people in your house who don't like to
320169	hear your late-night gaming so we've got
322060	a few more keys over here these look
323680	like media eject I've got a few to
325540	program stuff here things here these are
327490	your back and forward buttons which are
329140	apparently supposedly easily accessible
331180	while you're gaming now I'm sure there
333760	was something else I was gonna say about
335230	this maybe the cameraman can prompt me
336970	or maybe there's nothing maybe that was
339070	all I had to say about it thank you for
340690	checking out my unboxing and product
342820	overview of the Microsoft recluse a
345160	keyboard powered by Razer
346660	I finally remember the thing I wanted to
349870	do I had mentioned before this keyboard
351700	is so heavy but I pulled out my
354610	benchmark my benchmark golden standard
357310	for heaviest keyboard ever this like
360070	fossilised model m and i'm still giving
363130	the nod to the model and both in terms
365290	of keyswitch quality of course because
367419	it's the bestower oh don't get too close
368650	to that this is this isn't mine I just
371290	received this as I hand-me-down from
372820	someone I'm gonna run it through the
373780	dishwasher first I don't even know if I
375700	want to admit to owning this keyboard
377080	but the point is that it is still
379720	heavier than the reclusa
