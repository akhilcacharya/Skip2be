3270	/l tt it's the simple VPN so we're here
7680	in the msi suite where they are showing
10050	off the GE 63 raider RGB edition now RGB
17490	including RGB keyboards isn't anything
20160	new to msi but this guy which isn't too
23490	out for I mean at least three to five
27119	months something along those lines has
29279	some pretty cool stuff built into it
31349	first let's do just kind of a basic
33120	quick overview we've already got it
34739	unplugged so he may as well show you
35820	guys around
36360	you got your SD reader he got your USB
38190	you've got your whoo they've got a new
40200	cooling solution built into this which
42059	basically amounted to redesigned thin
44160	design for the fans and more seat pipe
46590	they're calling that cooler boost fight
48030	so you can see some of the heatsink fins
49920	right here right here right here and Wow
53250	right here so that was a lot of metal
54899	built into that thing you got Ethernet
56670	HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort USB and
59780	vulnerable with four PCI Express Lanes
62460	so you could hook it up to an external
63660	graphics card but you might not need to
66479	because this thing will be available
67650	with anything from a 1050 Ti all the way
69960	up to a gtx 1070 somewhere in the 1,500
72450	to 2,000 dollar price point but one of
74580	the special things they've done here is
75960	really in the software so it's got a
78390	game sense compatible keyboard meaning
80490	that you can configure it to show your
82530	ammo or your health with the RGB
84420	lighting actually the RGB on the back is
87060	game sense compatible as well so let's
88680	say you and your whole clan or set up
90600	side by side you could have it go from
92220	green to yellow to red to off as you
94530	guys lose health and die I mean I'm
96960	personally into configuring my RGB to
98970	like reflect the poorness of how well
101159	I'm doing so that's pretty cool and then
103290	in terms of other features keyboard is
105180	pretty typical fare for MSI and oh right
107970	hardware so unclear whether it'll be G
111149	sync or not but it's available with
112530	either a 1080p 120 Hertz panel or 4k 60
115439	Hertz we need 4k 120 that can't come
118829	soon enough and the internals now I
121770	don't know if I'm allowed to do this I'm
123390	gonna do it really quickly before anyone
124649	stops me but if you open up task manager
139200	you got to be kidding me so for some
141900	reason I can't imagine why somebody came
144209	over and took that laptop from me on a
146790	totally unrelated note there's a new
149190	version of the vortex so the gaming
151319	version we've shown you guys before with
153390	the core i7 and the up to GTX 1070 but
157260	this one right here has an undisclosed
160849	Intel future Xeon processor in it that I
165599	would speculate is probably based on
168660	coffee Lake which as we know from the
170790	desktop variants goes up to six core so
174060	if that were to happen that would be
175950	pretty cool
176640	and to round out the workstation as' of
179579	it it is also going to be shipping
181680	sometime later this year with an
183810	undisclosed NVIDIA Quadro mobile
187739	graphics solution so I would speculate
190950	based on what I know about Pascal and
193319	its naming scheme we could be looking at
194940	something like a B 5000 either way this
198420	is gonna be a super slick super sexy and
201170	super-powerful workstation up to six
204209	cores up to 64 gigs of ECC memory and
207019	Quadro graphics so thanks to tunnel bear
