990	[Music]
6980	hey guys this is pretty cool this is the
10349	kind of thing that I don't often have
12000	the opportunity to take a look at this
13950	is the TF 500rs from Thrustmaster and
17670	the difference between the RS and the
20100	non RS is that the non RS is the one
22109	that I would personally be interested in
23519	because it's compatible with PC as well
25019	but this is the ps3 only one other than
28500	that they are pretty much the same idea
30539	so we're going to start by getting it
32549	opened up because this is going to be a
34200	bit of an ordeal to open because it's
36690	big and it's heavy
37950	in fact that's even a selling point of
40170	the device in the first place it's one
42360	of the things that Thrustmaster puts
43739	right on the front of the box it's heavy
47430	which it better be for how much it costs
50579	I guess so if you're looking at in terms
51930	of like dollars per pound then you know
55860	you could go to XE comm and you can find
57899	out what the actual exchange rate is or
59789	you could just I'm just kidding that's a
63120	little that's a little exchange rate
65970	humor I think is I think is an
68640	underdeveloped an underdeveloped field
71189	of inmate in the humor scientist
73350	Sciences basically I'm just stalling
78150	guys I'm just stalling I'm trying to get
80100	the box open and figure out what we've
82350	got to deal with here and I wanted to
84210	talk about how Frost faster does call
87479	out specifically the weight of their
89820	pedal set right on the front fifteen
91829	point four pounds for the 100% metal
95340	pedal set it also has two positions GT
99030	and Raleigh or f1 so you can actually
101130	switch it around to mount it either this
103020	way or this way and it looks like this
105149	is the one that comes out of the box so
107960	let's actually know I'm going to get it
109979	D pakka five and then we'll be back in a
111479	second so why would you pay more for a
113579	racing wheel the simple answer is build
116189	quality so yes all-metal extremely
120030	rugged construction great feedback on
122579	the pedals it actually feels like
124170	pressing on a brake as opposed to just
126780	being a piece of plastic that doesn't
129090	feel like pressing on a brake these are
130889	fully removable which is really cool so
133050	you can
133500	we customized the whole unit quite a bit
136140	according to your particular preferences
138450	so there's your so gas brake and clutch
142410	all have different tensions so that they
145470	feel a gently different now switching
147480	between the two different modes is
148770	actually really simple all you have to
150959	do is flip it like this use the included
155459	allen key to move the diamond plate down
158250	to the bottom and then you are in the
160680	other mode and then I guess you can I
162840	guess you just have to switch around
163860	through the software the functionality
165630	and then you can actually switch the
166950	pedals over like that that's really cool
169530	so okay the bottom can also be fully
172560	taken apart and rearranged according to
175200	how you want see they've even got wing
176640	nuts on there as opposed to you know
178650	building it with rivets or hex screws or
180750	you know stuff they don't want you to
182760	take apart because they don't want you
184320	to see how it's built tends to be
185910	riveted together not the case so you got
189390	a nice big rubber non-slip grip e pads
192270	six of them on this one and four of them
195030	here so you shouldn't have any problems
196950	with it moving around while you're
198480	trying to use it and the pedals connect
201000	to the top via um what is that RC R RJ
204330	RJ 11 is that what it's called whatever
206549	the phone jack one okay so let's put
209610	that down for now man it's heavy and now
212160	we get to the meat and potatoes of this
215580	particular unit which is the actual meal
218250	itself so it has a little base station
220080	standing guy here which goes like that
222480	I'm not actually going to install it for
223860	the time being you've got all the
225420	hardware pieces that you may or may not
227370	need you've also got the huge power
229829	brick why is there a huge power brick
232530	with this wheel and the reason is quite
235049	simple there is a 3000 rpm motor inside
238590	here that gives you a variety of
241560	different things it gives you the
243440	responsiveness and the torque necessary
246390	for much better force feedback then
249209	you're going to find on a less expensive
251480	racing wheel it also gives you that
254370	responsiveness so Wendy when the motor
256589	spinning faster you get a quicker
259140	response depending on what it's trying
260880	to do than it would if the motor was
262770	spinning slower so you get that you also
264810	get ah
266730	and extremely well-built racing wheel
269910	here so you've got 10 buttons overall I
272010	believe on the outside these are 18
274110	centimeter shifters so that pretty much
276390	no matter where you are in your steering
277920	you can actually shift them they're also
279480	affixed to the base which has a couple
281550	of advantages one is it's not going to
283320	move the wheel around when you're trying
284610	to when you're trying to press on them
286500	so you're not going to accidentally
287580	shift a little bit number two is it
289830	gives you the flexibility to upgrade
291390	your wheel so you can actually
292350	completely remove the wheel and replace
294960	it with something when an upgrade is
296610	available in the future that's something
298050	that they have built in as functionality
300000	with this unit um all right let's talk
303510	about the wheel a little bit more so
304800	it's got a very grippy feeling outside
307770	but there's a little bit of slide as
309210	well basically it feels like a steering
310650	wheel which is the complaint that I have
312480	about some of the some of the steering
314940	wheels that I've encountered in the past
316020	that just don't really feel like a
317460	steering wheel it's big like a steering
319800	wheel as opposed to again being small
321690	and not really feeling like a real
322830	steering wheel in terms of buttons this
324690	is the ps3 exclusive ones so it's got
326790	you know PlayStation buttons r2 l2 d-pad
331310	and then the triangle squared damages
334770	who has and then there's also your
336840	additional ones down here and you can
338910	switch between modes down here as well
341640	give me a sec guys
343050	so more about the wheel itself it can
345660	actually do three full turns
347460	so 1080 degrees rotation which means you
350790	are not limited to you know driving your
353130	car like in your mario kart style no you
356460	can actually turn the wheel when you're
358410	trying to turn the car which is very
359910	cool as well now they talk a quite quite
362370	a bit about the the powerful quick
364380	responding force feedback but what's
366420	equally important if you're going to
367650	have powerful force feedback is having a
370380	way to stop it so it has a rigid
372090	motorized stopper no matter what angle
374400	of rotation you've selected it will be
376740	able to respond the way that the game
380070	intends in the way that the car would
381930	have intended assuming the game is an
383460	accurate representation of the car which
385260	not all of them are but some of them are
386730	pretty close I'm given to understand so
391490	right okay fluid move action silent
394620	system seems to be not very loud
396690	although I don't own a ps3 so I actually
398820	have no way of verifying
400460	right the size of the wheels 12 inches
402680	so if you guys don't want to see an
404750	iPhone comparison then I'll just tell
406550	you in real real measurements it's 30
408770	centimetres or 12 inches and sorry there
411260	were 12 12 buttons not 10 that was my
413990	mistake before oh right then piece in
416060	the middle so this is actually brushed
417800	aluminum and looks really sharp so you
420740	got the rubberized outside and then the
422660	brushed aluminum inside and the shiny
424970	again inner piece here it looks very
427160	very sharp although I think you guys can
428540	clearly see that for yourself now in
431060	terms of mounting mechanisms you got
433610	your rubber grip enos here you got a way
435830	to mount it to the bottom of something
437690	here you've got a variety of different
439160	mounting options so yeah it's big
441890	yeah takes up space in your house but if
443870	you are a racing enthusiast then it is
447130	probably a compromise that you are
449510	willing to make though I think that
452090	pretty much wraps it up it does have
454310	internal memory so you can upgrade the
455930	firmware which is something I've
457010	forgotten all right no last thing 65,536
463840	like data points or poling points or
467230	positions around the wheel so what that
470150	means is okay basically here's the
472400	extreme examples if you're using a d-pad
474470	to play a racing game you know how you
476360	kind of in order to get like a like a
478960	sorry a light turn you have to kind of
481940	like tap it once in a while because the
484130	only two positions you have are like it
486170	and like this which is not realistic
489170	this has 65,000 Plus 65,536 positions
495680	all the way around the wheel which means
497180	if you make a slight adjustment your car
500690	will genuinely make a slight adjustment
502550	so that granularity of control is again
505610	one of the things that sets apart are
507080	more you know legit racing wheel from
510170	something that is well not as legit and
512659	not as well not as expensive I guess but
515809	if you really want to play racing games
517700	and be comfortable and
519500	you know more accurate driving
520669	experience and there you go this seems
522650	pretty pretty awesome actually I kind of
524780	want to try and I wish I had a ps3 I
526280	wish I had the PC version though is
527750	actually what I wish I had but there you
529190	go
529460	so that is my unboxing of the T 500
531200	we're going to pretend it's not the RS
532910	I'm going to call it the T 500 don't
534830	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
536450	for more unboxings reviews and other
539120	computer videos
