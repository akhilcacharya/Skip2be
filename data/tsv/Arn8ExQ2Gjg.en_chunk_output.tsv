30	why on earth would anyone want a second
3030	keyboard Linus asked me when I tried to
5819	show him this project I've been working
7500	on for quite a while well let me tell
9540	you it's not for everyone but if you are
12120	a productivity freak like me the concept
14700	might really appeal to you basically
16949	this entire keyboard has been converted
18990	into a set of 87 fully programmable
22039	macro keys
31880	intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
34590	their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
37640	6600 K processors check out the link in
40470	the video description to learn more so
42030	to give you some background on why I
44850	need a second keyboard I'm the video
47940	editor for most of the videos that go up
50160	on this channel that's a lot of videos
52530	and the more quickly and efficiently I
54360	can edit them the better now
56850	fast and efficient video editing relies
59100	heavily upon keyboard shortcuts so much
62070	so that inside premiere I assigned
64260	functions to all the numbers letters and
66570	symbols all the function keys the entire
69510	numpad and most of the reasonable
72090	combinations of ctrl shift and alt
74549	that's a lot of shortcuts and yes I do
77400	use all of those on a daily basis it's
80010	easy to remember single key shortcuts
82350	but the more keys you need to press in a
84869	row the more difficult it is to not only
86970	remember the key combination but also to
89310	physically press those keys
90960	that's what macro Keys are good for if
93780	you don't know a macro key we'll
95820	basically launch a pre-programmed series
98100	of keystrokes and/or mouse clicks which
100710	you would otherwise have to press
102000	manually every time for example let's
104850	say I'm editing a video in Premiere and
106920	I want to reverse a clip on the timeline
108900	to do this I could click on the clip
111870	mouse over to the clip menu select speed
114840	duration mouse over to the panel that
116730	appears click reverse and then mouse
119610	over to enter and click on that this
122400	takes a few seconds to do alternatively
125130	I could just press one single macro
127710	button which automatically executes the
130199	keystrokes ctrl R tab tab space enter
133290	which accomplishes exactly the same
135390	thing but in a fraction of a second
137580	that's the power and usefulness of a
140190	keyboard macro gamers will use macros in
143190	games like World of Warcraft dota
145230	Starcraft League of Legends and so on
147870	but pretty much any game can be made
149670	easier with macros and keyboard macros
152310	are also really useful for certain jobs
154049	like video editing animation graphic
157200	design programming music creation and I
160620	don't know accounting maybe I don't
163200	really know what accountants do
164430	all day but pretty much anything that
166260	involves heavy computer use and
168060	repetitive tasks usually macros are just
171120	a series of blind keystrokes and mouse
173459	clicks but you can make even more
176400	powerful macros using autohotkey
179120	autohotkey is a free brilliant little
182370	program that you can use to completely
184469	automate repetitive tasks remap Keys
187170	intelligently simulate clicks and
189180	keystrokes and do a lot more stuff that
191400	I don't even understand I've used auto
193799	hotkey to program a ton of useful
196019	features for Premiere Pro that don't
198569	even exist in the application itself
200489	like recalling saved transitions and
202650	applying effects directly onto selected
205139	clips but my problem now is that I use
208049	so many macros and so many keyboard
210480	shortcuts that I have now physically run
212639	out of keys on the keyboard
214680	and what can you do then well we have a
217680	few of these cool little tech Keys
220260	keyboards lying around the office so I
223109	experimented with those we also have a
225930	Razer orb-weaver which is actually
228299	pretty awesome and it's been designed
229949	for this exact purpose all of its keys
233250	can be remaps to any key or key
235620	combination you desire now since you're
238019	still restricted to standard keyboard
240329	keys what I like to do is program the
242669	keys on these extra keyboards to execute
244829	very obscure key combinations like ctrl
248220	alt f1 and then I program autohotkey to
252000	listen for these key combinations and
253919	then execute whatever function I desire
256440	the trouble is if you do too much of
258839	this it's tough to remember what
261120	combinations you've already used and
263159	what combinations all your various
265110	different applications might already be
267300	using but you know what the tech keys
269639	keyboards and the orb-weaver still don't
272580	have enough keys for all the extra
274830	functions that I want and these
277229	keyboards are surprisingly expensive and
280169	that's when it hit me why can't I just
282539	hook up a second keyboard to my computer
285570	well it turns out that Windows will
288150	treat every keyboard that you plug in as
290550	one keyboard you can plug in all the
293550	keyboards you like but your computer
295229	cannot tell the difference but
297610	between them bummer fortunately one of
300370	my Twitter followers linked me to this
302469	video by Tom Scott who successfully got
305759	14 keyboards to work as their own
308530	separate inputs
310090	he used a program called Lua macros
312550	which was actually developed for flight
314949	simulator enthusiasts who want to have a
317469	lot of switches and buttons for their
319569	virtual cockpits great so it is possible
322990	now all I needed to do was figure out
325539	how to code in Lua and find a way to get
329020	Lua macros to communicate with
331090	autohotkey which is where all of my
332949	functions already are Tom Scott had done
335949	this but he didn't provide any of the
338199	necessary details like you know sample
341590	code then it presses the f24 King
344710	themselves after quite a bit of
346419	frustration I finally figured out how to
349090	do it my second keyboard now works as
352120	its own unique input and every single
355150	one of these keys acts as a macro button
357939	which will launch its own unique
359949	autohotkey script so here's how you do
363159	it first download Lua macros and
365620	autohotkey plug-in both of the keyboards
368319	you want to use run Lua macros and open
371169	up QuickStart Lua then click on the play
374650	button you'll get a prompt asking you to
377169	identify device macros which will become
379990	the name of your second keyboard all you
382900	need to do is press any key on that
384729	second keyboard Lua macros will now
387219	recognize it as such
388479	and those keystrokes will now be
390219	intercepted by Lua macros and therefore
393129	blocked from normal typing once you get
395469	that working you can write your own code
397330	or download and use my Lua code which
400389	basically just writes a small string to
402759	a file on disk and then presses the f24
405849	key download my autohotkey script or
408460	write your own and double click on it to
410529	get it running an icon for that script
412750	will now appear on the taskbar now any
415689	time the f24 key is virtually pressed by
418870	Lua macros this autohotkey script will
421750	read the string in that file and execute
424629	the correct associated function tada
427930	I knew it would be difficult to remember
430840	which key did what so I created a bunch
433330	of key cap images in Photoshop printed
436030	them cut them out and taped them onto
438280	the existing keys if you do this keep in
440889	mind that your key caps will not
442240	necessarily be compatible with every
444760	slot on the keyboard so you may have to
446710	be careful to maintain the underlying
448479	QWERTY layout although for me I think it
450669	was just the F and J keys the keyboard
453430	that I used for this project was the
454870	logitech k120 and it's nothing special
458350	at all any cheap or old keyboard will
461139	work perfectly
462130	when using the second keyboard it does
464650	take about two seconds to look down find
467500	the key you want move your hand over to
469450	that key press it and then move your
471370	hand back to the primary keyboard so
473740	it's best to use the secondary keyboard
475630	for secondary functions that you don't
478000	need all that often if you want to try
480790	building and programming a second
482350	keyboard
482860	I will be providing all the necessary
485229	code in the video description you're
488080	welcome and before you say it I know
490150	that my code is sloppy and suboptimal I
493510	know but guess what it still works so if
497229	any of you real programmers out there
499479	want to complain about my messy code I
502360	sure would appreciate it if you could
504460	provide a functional sample of some code
507130	that will work even better a great place
509560	to do this will be in the Linus tech
511419	tips discussion thread that is
513190	associated with this video also linked
515440	below there's still a lot to figure out
517059	like using modifier keys and double
519580	tapping to launch a different function
521080	in fact Lua macros itself is just a side
524860	project of a single man with very little
527830	free time it's not even out of beta and
530800	it still got a lot of bugs the good news
533380	is the software is open source so if you
536589	can help to make Lua macros better
538420	I really suggest that you do I think it
541240	would be great if we could use the power
542620	of our community to improve useful niche
545589	software like Lua macros personally I'm
548920	very satisfied with my secondary
550990	keyboard and I'm really looking forward
552940	to seeing what you guys come up with
555089	tunnel bear is the easy to use VPN app
558339	for mobile and desktop it allows you to
561130	tunnel to 16 different countries and
563260	browse the internet and
564700	use online services as if you're in one
567340	of those other countries they have apps
569350	for iOS Android PC and Mac and they also
572020	have a Chrome extension when you pick a
574210	country and turn tunnel bear on two
575860	things will happen your connection gets
577690	encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
579790	the strongest available and your public
582940	IP address gets switched so you can show
585220	up as if you're in a different country
587020	with tunnel bear there's no need to mess
589030	around with port configurations DNS or
591700	router settings or all that nonsense it
594010	just handles all of that by itself you
596740	don't have to worry about it they also
598300	give you 500 megabytes of data for free
600760	so you can try it out no credit card
603160	required and if you want to upgrade to
605050	unlimited data you can save 10% by going
607690	to tunnel bear comm /l tt thanks for
610960	watching guys give the video a like or a
612820	dislike get subscribed join the forum
615880	and talk about Lua macros or whatever
618700	you can support us by changing your
620770	Amazon bookmarks to one with our
622150	affiliate code so we get a small
623650	kickback whenever you buy something and
625780	you should check out another one of my
627250	videos up here or wherever where I talk
629530	about the fly cly and how incredibly
631360	disappointing it was no the smartpen I
634300	keep forgetting what it was called it's
636370	terrible
