30	thank you a tunnel better for sponsoring
1560	this video at CES 2018 tunnel bear makes
3929	very easy to use privacy apps for the
6089	Internet so that you can enjoy a more
7890	open Internet to try it out for free go
9960	to telomere comma slash LT t we're here
12780	checking out wallet card they're the
14460	same size and physical feel as a normal
17369	credit card they're still waterproof
19289	they're still resistant to tears as
21689	they're made out of plastic but you
23939	might notice the ePaper display and the
26039	left and right buttons on the side you
28560	might be wondering why well the wallet
30660	card can store up to 100 credit cards
32940	within itself the arrow keys are for
34950	switching between the cards the ePaper
36780	display is for displaying what card you
39329	currently have selected it is worth
41340	noting however that you can't mix banks
44370	and networks on the same wallet card so
46920	if you have like a Bank of America visa
49260	and a TD MasterCard they can't be on the
52230	same wallet card but if you had a USD
55800	and a CAD and a rewards card all from
58500	the same bank say TD or whatever else
60840	that could all be on one wallet card
63690	it's all handled for you
65309	the cards are added to wallet card over
66930	the same secure network that credit
68430	cards use right now it's powered by
71150	movements in the same way that
72900	self-winding watches are so it's never
74850	gonna die when you switch cards the tap
78210	mag stripe and chip payment methods all
80549	automatically switch with it there's
82590	even a cellular connection so if you
84180	lose the card it can be wiped remotely
85830	in the bill for the cellular connection
87600	is being footed by your bank although
89369	I'm sure that will trickle down to some
90869	cost for you at somewhere along the
92970	chain another option more based around
95280	just one card but with advanced security
97409	is well their security card in addition
100500	to your standard four digit PIN they
102060	have a 12 digit PIN based on one two
104549	three four and five the physical input
106829	keys on the card this will make it so
109229	that you can't even do any form of
111119	payments unless the pin has been entered
112920	and it won't even show the number for
116159	the card on the front unless you enter
118560	those digits as well I also wouldn't
120780	worry about brute force as by default
122159	you can only attempt the access code up
124350	to eight times before the card locks up
126689	and locks new out
128240	go to the bank and get it unlocked very
130550	cool security feature for someone who
131960	might lose the card as you don't really
133970	have to worry that much about losing it
135350	anymore it's a code for your credit card
136970	is hidden and you can't access it and
139040	it's immune to brute force go speaking
142280	of making things easier you can use
143600	tunnel bear to create a VPN for you and
145880	it's all simple you don't have to do any
147050	router settings you know if you're doing
148310	firewall settings you just turn on the
149810	app the bear tunnels you to whatever
151340	server location you want and it's all
153350	done it's all handled your privacy is
155030	secure they'll help protect you against
156770	people that are trying to profit off of
158600	your data because it will protect from
160490	that and did I mention it's free go to
