6830	this is actually kind of a cool product
9179	this is an SEO keyboard the KB 505 you
12420	it is a large print tricolor backlight
14969	keyboard I think that is about as
16730	self-explanatory as a keyboard could
19380	possibly be it has a three year limited
20939	warranty with lifetime support by phone
22920	live chat email and warranty that's
26250	fascinating so three-year limited
27800	lifetime support
29400	warranty I don't know what that means
31189	let's assume a three-year warranty easy
33960	to read keys large print keys to reduce
35730	eye strain and promote productivity
36930	tricolor backlight select between red
38879	blue or purple backlight illuminations
40350	and quick access keys built-in
42210	multimedia and quick access hotkeys so
45600	this is great for people who don't see
47370	that well like if you have some kind of
49469	a visual visual disability or I don't
53309	remember what they call it now I think
54629	it's like differently-abled sorry I guys
58379	I cannot remember the correct PC term
60719	for like a visual impairment I know it's
63750	not correct to say impairment but I'm
65640	sorry so if you have like a visual
69409	inability to see things that are small
71610	and hard to see this would be super
75420	handy because the backlight is not just
78119	necessarily for for use when it's dark
82170	you know in a gaming scenario like I
83820	think they're I think someone told me it
86460	was a gaming keyboard it doesn't look
87810	like it's the gaming at all but I can
89040	see I would be fine for gaming because
90689	again you know having that having that
93900	visibility the keys is certainly
95460	something that you know gamers would
96960	appreciate so I'm just gonna plug this
98280	into you guys can see it I'm not only
100020	that but I mean for someone like my mom
101759	who is uh who's hit that uh that fifty
107100	year old mark where she's starting to
108810	not be able to see quite as well up
110939	close anymore something like this would
112740	be really handy for her so I mean she's
115049	a touch typist
115829	so maybe less for her but especially
117420	like for your grandparents or people who
119520	are getting to be a little bit
121590	nearsighted and and they don't
123630	necessarily touch type or know the
125250	keyboard layout well this kind of thing
127170	is awesome because you can much more
128970	easily and more quickly find exactly
131670	what you're looking for
132959	so
133530	just go ahead and figure out how to cha
135750	ha there we go oh nice there we go I
139620	think the red ones probably the big
140970	winner in terms of the like the contrast
143280	the richness of the color and the and
145860	the readability of it what do you think
147270	yeah slick sort of nodding in agreement
148620	but I'm sort of as boss so he kind of
151290	has to nod in agreement when I talk
152520	about things so we're going to leave it
154350	on read while we have a look at the
155520	general layout so it's a very very
157080	standard looking layout you got your
159270	long shifts long enter and long
161130	backspace which is great because if it
162930	didn't have that I'd be very very sad
164370	you also have a lot of pretty different
166830	buttons on this one so up to here it's
168660	all completely standard out to here
170700	insert and del delete are also very
173040	standard and is standard but then we get
175230	the indecisive button the puh button and
177630	the arm the postscript button so this is
181709	when you're not finished right in your
182940	email and you want to press that button
185700	to automatically enter down a couple
187709	times and type PS the puh button is
190260	actually there's there's a smell limiter
192300	on the bottom of the board and when you
194220	press that button you'll actually get an
196410	olfactory sensation that watts to your
199560	nose and will like no I'm just kidding
201570	okay so uh this is um shoot what is this
206510	print screen right okay this is scroll
210090	lock this is uh shoot I don't know what
213870	that is pause and break okay
217290	so then this is the part where it gets
218640	more confusing than a regular keyboard
220320	home and page up page down number lock
223590	and other than that everything is pretty
225450	standard so you've got all your typical
228090	media keys you play pause back forward
230640	and the stop button as well as your
232440	email home and favorites audio controls
235790	launching a media player whatever that
238079	does and now watching the calculator app
240510	I love dedicated calculator buttons
242250	that's awesome I think that pretty much
244799	covers it so inexpensive backlit nice
249060	big keys actually has kind of a nice
251280	aesthetic to it as well don't forget to
