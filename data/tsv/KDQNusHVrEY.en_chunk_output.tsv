6560	it's like I kind of eel sorry dude
10620	diesel was telling me about mawari
12360	because he's lamenting my wearing of
14820	stripes but stripes are not the point of
17400	the video today the point of the video
19140	today is the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
21230	2013 this is a cherry MX blue fully
24750	mechanical keyboard with evidently
26789	improved anti-ghosting and backlighting
29609	so it's got a full green backlight it
32250	has ten key rollover which a lot of
35309	people talk about you know how many keys
37230	the rollover does a keyboard have okay I
40410	mean I know and key rollovers cool
42350	however I would go as far as to say that
45210	unless you're playing two player games
47070	at your keyboard with two people I mean
49230	have you ever done that slick he says
51390	he's done that but okay I would say that
53039	that's not that common unless you're
55500	playing two player games at your
56940	keyboard with two people with both hands
58649	on the keyboard probably you can only
60719	press ten keys at a time so they have
63390	ten key rollover which means at the very
65519	least although you can't type with your
67080	face you can type with both hands
69000	completely at the same time so there you
72090	go individually backlit keys and they
74970	look quite bright in razors photographs
77670	and all that so we're going to make sure
79110	we test that oh I love this okay I've
81570	seen this before and I can tell you
83670	right now that it makes a huge huge
86130	difference to the brightness the
89130	intensity of the backlight when they do
90630	this you see that green backplate behind
93450	the keyboard number one is that should
96360	improve the how solid it feels does feel
99479	quite well constructed actually let's do
100920	the old flex test so here I'm actually
102990	putting pretty much as much force as I
104759	can on it to get it to flex very well
107549	constructed so you can see that right
109350	can you see like it's not bending much
111149	so that's good and then what it also
113700	does is it gives the green LEDs behind
116460	each key something to reflect off of
118979	which makes the lights much brighter and
121170	more vibrant it looks really really good
123600	sighs so I've seen this before on the
125399	Quickfire TK from Coolermaster so that's
129000	okay that's just packaging again razor
131520	so good at packaging all
133250	insides all matte black and - alright so
137480	up okay let's just slice that open there
142760	we go
143180	so braided cord you can go ahead and
145190	check that out Wow
146630	really good really good non-slip pads on
148760	the bottom of the keyboard it's not
149900	going anywhere once you put it down and
151370	had a hard time moving it just now so
153320	I'll show you guys that in a minute
154430	you've also got audio pass throughs as
156650	well as what appears to be a USB
158660	pass-through yep
159710	so that's for the keyboard itself it's
161810	labeled port okay then you've got your
164210	microphone and headphones which plug in
166340	probably on the side I think yep there
168110	you go there's your pass-through which
169430	is positioned correctly for you know I'd
171350	love to see someone come out with the
172910	mouse that has a short cord like an
174470	apple length cord and that is designed
177200	to be plug into a keyboard because so
178490	many gaming keyboards have these ports
179930	on them but then you got a mouse that
181310	has an 8 foot long cord on it because
183050	it's designed to go down to your PC
184310	Razer if you're watching this video I
186500	want a short mouse cord ok so there we
190070	headphone microphone port wrist rest
193570	symmetrical even I'd say it's not quite
197420	long enough for me personally but if you
199370	don't rest your wrists on the keyboard
201140	which you shouldn't which is bad for you
203030	then I guess it's going to be just fine
204560	you can hear that sound of the Cherry MX
206630	blues so these keyboards are not for
212900	people who are looking for silence or
216080	households that are looking for silence
218030	if you want that then you're going to
219590	want blacks or browns blues are quite
222860	quite loud but they have a really great
225260	feel for typing and I get a lot of
227150	people asking you this they kind of go
228769	all well Linus you know I I you know
231650	which keys are best for for typing and
233810	which ones are best for gaming now the
235010	argument could be made that Keys like
236780	blacks or browns are better for gaming
238430	because they don't have that that click
241549	that discernible tactile feel as you're
243769	pushing it down personally I like that
245989	for gaming I like gaming on a very
247820	tactile keyboard these particular keys
249620	have 50 grams of actuation force so you
251930	can compare that to other keyboards
253130	figure out if you like a heavier key or
254720	a lighter key but I like knowing when
257209	I've pushed it down and because they're
259040	designed to instantly respond back up I
262039	don't find that the that the tactile
264440	catch actually makes that much of a
265970	difference for me
267100	on the bottom like I said we've got
268210	extremely good grips here and these I
270970	love this design of these as well you
272710	see how there's a rubber grip on this
273970	side and it goes all the way around to
275380	the other side it's a rubber cap which
277180	means that no matter how this keyboard
278920	is sitting on the table so you can angle
281080	it up about like that oops I knocked it
282910	down there you go it's not going to move
285460	anywhere no matter what you do so really
288010	really good stuff programmable keys
290350	which you can record on the fly so on
292300	the fly macro recording is included
294040	we've got also function keys here so you
296110	can use function mute volume down volume
298180	up audio media controls macros game mode
302560	which will turn your windows key off
303910	LEDs down LEDs up no LED zones on this
307570	one the whole keyboard lights up
308770	personally I've never used an LED zone
310330	in my life as well as a sleep button
312610	let's just see if I've missed anything
314260	well we go find a computer to plug this
316930	bad boy into so fully programmable keys
319420	plus five additional Oh
320950	oh no oh yeah diesels not really sure
323950	what to do so hold on let us figure this
325420	out so we found a computer plugged it in
331810	this is the coolest thing like ever I
334660	check this out so function seven eight
339040	nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
341170	fifteen sixteen se bun yet not 17 18 19
345400	it has like it has like between 15 and
348460	20 or whatever it is or at least 10
351010	different brightnesses you can hold it
353020	down and go all the way bright all the
354850	way dark but it is extremely
357220	customizable in terms of how bright you
359560	want the Black Widow ultimate 2013 to be
361900	here we're going to go ahead and turn it
363250	back on I just want to show you all the
364300	different backlit parts of the keyboard
365680	so all the keys are backlit all the
368020	little Razer logo at the bottom is
369250	backlit and it should be noted this is
370450	the only glassy part of this keyboard
372070	everything else is a gorgeous matte
374470	black that won't show fingerprints or
376750	cheeto stains or whatever else is a
378640	problem for you at your particular
380260	keyboard check this out so there's your
382180	macro record there's your game mode even
384040	these lights up here are completely
386380	matte so there's your number lock so you
388600	check that out so cool you can't even
390700	see its bare until you go ahead and
392110	press it so I want to turn the lights
393220	off for a minute here and show you guys
395040	what it looks like when things get all
397870	romantic in the tech tip studio
400590	extremely bright backlight which you
403210	know again razer understands not
404800	everyone will necessarily like so you
406990	can turn that bad boy down you know to
409659	like a just sort of a light glow or you
412270	can turn it all the way down so now we
414400	can find out how many levels there's 1 2
416289	3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16
423550	looks like about 15 so oh yeah right
427569	fully programmable keys plus gaming keys
430870	now not everyone's going to agree with
433240	having only 5 gaming keys personally I
435219	like it because whenever you ever have a
437199	huge like block of keys over here
439000	there's no way you're using all of them
440650	anyway you'll can only use a few I
442300	wouldn't have mind having a few profiles
443889	for them though so you could have
445000	different different sets of them but
446740	remember the synapse 2.0 software has a
448750	lot of customization that you can do on
450550	a per application basis as well so I
452620	guess razors assuming you're going to
454449	use their their software in order to
456189	configure your keyboard so that's
457719	probably a pretty safe assumption so I
459069	guess I take it back but the rest of the
460779	keys are fully programmable no cardinal
462639	sins have been committed in terms of the
464289	overall layout long shifts long
466240	backspace correctly position controls
469300	all that good stuff thank you for
