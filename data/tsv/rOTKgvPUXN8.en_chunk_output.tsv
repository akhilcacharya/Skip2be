0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to
2190	you by synergy synergy to makes sharing
4290	a single mouse and keyboard between
5609	multiple machines easier than ever check
7440	it out at the link below okay guys now
12210	this this is some crazy stuff I never
16230	thought I would live to see the day
18320	Intel and AMD technology in one box one
24420	box made by Intel this is the Hades
27119	Canyon nook it is their most powerful
29310	nook ever by a very significant margin
32520	and it is running an 8th gen Intel Core
35820	i7 processor and Radeon rx Vega mobile
40559	graphics now they're gonna have two
44520	different models that are gonna be
46260	available in bare-bones units just like
48180	previous Nook so what you get is you get
50370	the CPU the motherboard the case the
53129	power supply and oh right
56550	graphics so you got to add your own RAM
58469	and your own operating system but this
60210	thing is loaded for bear on the front
63690	you got your power switch yeah sure
65069	whatever reset or whatever that is SD
67470	reader 2 USB 3 ports HDMI out for VR yes
71850	my friends VR capable right you've got
74729	another USB this one's a Type C and
76890	you've got a front audio jack then
78900	moving it around to the back I got one
80790	that's not plugged in what this thing
83189	has 6 display outputs two HDMI 2.0 2
87509	mini DisplayPort 2 Thunderbolts at the
90750	back there's your power and also another
93119	audio jack Thank You rear audio on small
96659	form-factor really appreciate that that
98640	also does optical out 4 more USB threes
101820	to land ports because you know whatever
104250	we're just going to cover the whole
105720	thing in in i/o anyway and Oh check this
109110	out that right there is validated for a
112979	hundred watts of cooling because inside
115560	this thing on the high-end model there's
117630	a hundred watt model and there's a 65
119880	watt model you're gonna find a quad core
121740	hyper threaded processor the top-end one
124229	is actually overclockable and they've
126450	had it running up to five gigahertz in
128190	the lab and it is cooled by this frickin
130860	thing so the entire
132700	back half of the entire back is
134140	dedicated to heatsink with this sexy
136989	vapor chamber that covers one of the
139090	most unique processors that we have ever
142330	seen so right here on this side there's
144849	your quad-core Intel CPU right here on
147730	this side there's your Vega base yes my
150400	friends AMD's custom silicon solution
153280	department but same guys that have
154989	worked with the game console makers are
156670	actually providing a GPU to Intel and
159040	this is an HP m2 memory module so all
162640	three of these are sitting on this
164880	really special layer that I can actually
167950	even show you guys because it's so small
169360	that it's called an email and it allows
171310	high-speed communication between all
173319	three of these components so effectively
175360	this is a full PCI Express 8 X Gen 3
179200	link between the CPU and the GPU
181799	unbelievable and the whole thing is so
183940	thin that you're not just gonna see this
186549	in nooks you're also gonna see this
188440	integrated in laptops and Intel's
190120	expecting performance in the
192190	neighborhood of better than a 10 60 max
196299	q out of this tightly integrated
198609	solution they're also estimating that
200560	compared to Intel integrated graphics
202060	which we saw in the skull canyon look
203920	last year that we can see up to a 50%
207100	improvement in performance now it is a
209950	little bigger and it is a little thicker
212170	it's 1.2 liters compared to 0.7 liters
214660	for last generation but if you're
216639	looking for a tiny powerhouse of a
218620	machine I don't think you're gonna find
220209	anything close to this on the market not
223569	that this is actually on the market yet
225850	so let's get to that it's gonna be
227260	coming sometime later this year pricing
229720	is gonna be $7.99 for the 65 watt non
232540	overclockable version and approximately
235060	this is all estimates $9.99 for the
237160	overclockable one which CPU and GPU will
239829	be overclockable and you're gonna have
241989	to add your own ram your own operating
244299	system and your own storage which is
246940	interesting cuz they got - I've got two
249190	slots in there so you could put like a
251139	regular SSD or maybe octane that would
254530	be a cool idea
255310	I wonder if Intel thought of putting
257108	octane in there for super high-speed
258608	storage
260070	speaking of thinking of things have you
261970	guys given any thought to synergy -
263560	since the beginning of this video
265730	well you should it's the new generation
267890	of software from seamless that lets you
269300	share a keyboard and mouse between
270500	multiple computers be they Windows Mac
272810	OS and Linux it's pretty freaking cool
275510	and it's easier to configure then ever
277370	including now the ability to work around
279970	complicated networking configurations
282350	and automatically find the best path so
285050	go check it out at the link in the video
286310	description that's seamless comm slash
288980	synergy slash CES 1 and you can get 50%
292100	off so thanks for watching this video
295100	guys you can dislike you can like it's
297620	up to you you can also get subscribed
299780	and make sure you don't miss any of the
301910	rest of our content from CES 2018
305000	although I can't promise there's gonna
306770	be anything else more mind-blowing than
309080	this can you see that
313370	it's crazy
