960	[Music]
6680	welcome to my unboxing of the Philco
9000	magic such - this is a mechanical
12120	keyboard and you can see here Philco has
14940	so many different configurations of the
17609	keyboards they let you have pretty much
19109	whatever you could possibly want in
21689	terms of the layout so you can have you
24449	can have different layouts different
26010	sizes different switches under them you
28859	can have different color schemes of the
31170	keyboards we've unboxed the camel one
32880	before which is pretty cool
34530	this particular one has a black body
36270	cover with a 104 key arrangement so it
38670	doesn't have the missing number pad it
40530	has carry MX red switches which are
43860	basically like a softer version of the
47309	black switch so that is to say that it's
49890	very linear in terms of the travel there
52050	isn't like a resistance and then a click
54660	and then a release it's very linear and
57000	it requires less force to depress then a
59879	black switch which isn't to say that it
62730	has like a neurological disorder that
64530	causes it to be sad that is to just say
67110	that it is being pressed down depressed
72420	not like you know like it needs you know
77820	help from somebody to become undepressed
81060	although actually no because it doesn't
82950	need help to get I'm the one making it
85409	depressed and then if I would just stop
87840	putting so much pressure on it then it
90360	would be undepressed I don't know where
93299	I was gonna think that's okay so let's
94979	have a look at the keyboard itself
96689	Philco is a world renowned brand they're
100619	a Japanese brand pretty much if you're
103350	into keyboards and more people are into
105780	keyboards than you would think you have
107610	heard of Phil Coke you are familiar with
110040	Phil Coke and you probably want a Philco
112979	keyboard in some shape or form so they
116579	are known for their build quality very
119399	very solid keyboards it's not quite a
121500	model M but then again nothing is what
124530	can I say right however as far as modern
127350	keyboards go you aren't going to do any
129538	better than this there's absolutely no
131910	flex to the deck
133090	self there is that weight to it like
135849	it's not you know once again it's not a
137530	model and like you probably couldn't
138940	kill a man with it but you could stun it
141120	you know like if someone broke into your
144190	like you're gaming dead and you're all
145750	like oh yeah
147430	you know no like ax is nearby have your
149980	keyboard be like what pow and then
151810	hopefully you wouldn't wreck the USB
153610	port because this keyboard does plug
156280	into your computer by USB or ps2 with
159040	the adapter
159760	it features NQ rollover which means you
162340	can press as many things as you want
163569	without running into any difficulty with
165880	you know random ghosting and you know if
168459	you learn to type with your face then
170799	you could type with your face and that
172660	would be really weird looking but like
175180	probably effective in terms of the
177459	layout I love it
179440	because I'm one of those guys who wants
181450	to see long shifts enters and backspace
183760	keys because I have small hands and I
185260	can't reach a backspace key over here
187000	without moving my index finger off of
188680	the J which means that I'll get lost
190450	when I go back and then it'll be a total
192340	disaster and I don't know what to do um
194280	note all delete key thumbs up again
197940	don't function key on this one that's
200350	kind of interesting so two windows keys
202269	this isn't I guess not a more gaming
204160	oriented model whereas on the last
205870	gaming oriented one we had a function
207280	key here with the via keys up here and
208959	just two windows key on this side we've
211540	also got a full number pad and honestly
214120	in terms of the mechanical keyboard
216760	typing experience the number pad to me
219069	is very important because in my
221440	particular job I do a lot of typing on a
224349	number pad I can actually touch type
226030	faster on a number pad than I can
227680	actually touch type in terms of written
230079	like words and stuff because I enter a
233019	lot of numbers into my computer and
236099	mechanical keys make everything faster
238599	everyone that I have put a mechanical
240970	keyboard in front of types faster and is
243400	more comfortable than they are at a
244630	membrane key switch because they do
246669	provide more responsiveness more
248260	feedback and just the better they become
253480	depressed where he's under pressed more
255700	easily as well so that's a good thing to
257709	again build quality huge rubber pads
261060	quality rubber pads these are incredibly
263770	non-slip four of them on the bottom you
266080	can also
266500	flip up these guys right here and they
268000	have folding rubber pads that aren't
269890	going anywhere if you want to incline
271990	the keyboard a little bit and when it
273670	comes down to the fill comb yes they're
275140	expensive yes there are much better
276640	typing experience and yes you can get
278800	pretty much whatever you want in terms
280750	of the layout the color scheme the
282820	switches that you prefer try keyboards
285400	find out what you prefer personally I'm
287320	not an MX red guy it's just not my thing
290410	however that doesn't mean that I
292840	couldn't get this keyboard with
293980	different switches because feel cold
295240	rolls like that so don't forget to
