30	so today I'm going to be having a quick
1949	look at the Logitech g13 this is a
5310	gaming keyboard in the sense that it has
8690	gaming keys on it it is a board but it
12120	is not really a traditional keyboard
13500	this is actually more like that Nostrum
16109	Oh n52 item from Belkin except that this
20039	is a Logitech branded one and being
21960	Logitech it brings with it a lot of
24060	Logitech advantages so first of all
26340	Logitech is telling you okay you can
27960	have four different colored lights so if
30929	you can change the backlight color on
32399	your keys to four different colors
34170	they're saying there is game changing
36180	control you know I'm going to put this
37200	nice and close so you guys can actually
38940	read it yourself what is game changing
41610	comfort so they're saying the ergonomics
43379	of this are designed to give you the
45270	best possible comfort while you're
47610	playing games this is a gaming product
49469	it is for gamers for gaming and also
53129	they have something about 60 plus game
54690	panel enabled games including World of
57059	Warcraft actually I have a G 15 keyboard
59640	myself and I found that since I first
61859	got it when it was released like way
63719	back a million and one years ago the
65670	game support has gotten phenomenally
67770	good like I just installed a new game
69450	and boom
70740	it has my health or my ammo or whatever
73799	it is just on my lcd I don't even have
75750	to configure it anymore these days it's
77400	pretty cool so the first thing we find
79200	inside is probably a disc I'm assuming
82650	based on how inflexible it is yeah we
85740	find a QuickStart guide which is
87090	actually only about four pages just like
89250	that basically okay Quick Start Guide
91829	plug it in to a USB port and put the
95939	disc there that's your Quick Start Guide
97740	okay the next one is important
99720	information from Logitech will ignore
101340	that can be that important Logitech G
103680	Series key profiler download the latest
105540	one off the Logitech site as I always
107490	recommend and then let
109780	get down to business here so at the back
112510	of this box here is our USB cable tucked
115450	away in there so let's just pull that
117549	out oh this is a nice long cable
119140	actually and it's got kind of a sturdy
121450	thick cable feel to it so here should
124360	give you some idea how long it is long
126310	enough actually and they've probably
127540	thought of this putting such a long
129100	cable on a keyboard tech device it's
131350	long enough that you can kind of stick
133690	it away from your desk when you're not
135730	using it and then bring it up on to your
137410	desk when you're actually going to be
138730	playing a game so let's take the oh this
141489	is cool okay so when you're lifting the
143739	g13 out of the box you actually lift up
147100	the whole packaging here this is kind of
149620	like the wild mouse from SteelSeries and
151450	then you take off the plastic clamshell
152890	and then you can pull the g13 out get
157840	this out of here a lot of made a real
159069	mess in the box okay I'm actually going
160420	to lift the camera up here so that I can
162400	show you guys sort of what the
164019	ergonomics look like on this particular
166120	gamepad they've got a bit of a
167709	rubberized wrist rest right here so
170680	that's meant to be let's have a look
172030	from the side right where your pot right
175030	where your palm sits so that you don't
176560	actually have any gaps when you're
178570	resting naturally between your hand and
180400	the g13 and that is actually very very
183160	comfortable
183850	so these dented keys right here are
186280	meant to replace your WASD and then
188709	you've got all these programmable macro
191290	keys all over the place and like many
194110	Logitech Keyboard devices with the G
197079	series you've got em one and two and
198910	three M R so these are actually
201310	different profiles so you can completely
203410	reconfigure your key macros depending
206230	which one of these you have active
207760	obviously this is your brightness
209500	adjustment these are all unlabeled
211150	buttons I wish I could help you with
212290	those but I cannot and then there is
214269	your LCD screen now down here this is
216609	interesting too because normally the
218410	thumb is only good for one thing and
219850	that spacebar pretty much but here
222100	you've actually got a a analog joystick
225970	and then two buttons so you could find
228700	it to jump in something else anyway
230769	thank you for checking out my unboxing
232690	of the oh this is actually cool okay I'm
234459	not quite done yet you've got rubberized
236200	feet all over the bottom of the G 13 so
238659	that's going to keep it from slipping
239680	anywhere on your desk and they feel
241030	quite quite sticky quite grippy and then
243580	you've also got a metal plate on the
245650	bottom that's a very nice touch it's
247240	kind of a brushed metal finish on there
249370	and that's your g13 branding so to speak
252250	so thank you for checking out my
253570	unboxing of the Logitech g13 let's see
259600	if I can find this
