4680	link in the video description to learn
6060	more and start securing your passwords
8099	today this my friends is the new world's
13170	thinnest laptop the Acer swift 7 and I
17640	would forgive you for not being able to
19260	tell the difference between this one and
21210	the old Swift 7 based on the name but
23880	don't worry you guys they've got the
26849	model number SF 7 1 4-5 1 T that's how
31650	you can tell the difference now I don't
33480	condone calling products the same thing
35399	year after year but I'm also not sure if
37170	Acer has the right solution either way
38940	the name is not what counts it's all
41370	about the hardware so let's have a look
44760	at what they've managed to cram in here
47370	first up we've got a 7th gen core i7
51059	this time last time it was just a Core
54180	i5
54750	so now we've got a Core i7 7 y7 v CPU at
59160	a base of 1.3 you can actually see it's
61500	turbo into 3.3 gigahertz right now it's
64680	got 8 gigs of memory it's got 256 gigs
68549	of storage and it is just eight point
71250	nine eight millimeters thick making it
74850	just also 1.15 kilograms so this is
77520	among the lightest laptops we have ever
80250	seen as well improvements over the last
82680	generation in addition to the CPU also
86009	include a touch screen display now if
88650	you're into that sort of thing probably
90960	the most shocking thing about this guy
93090	is the keyboard it has an amazing amount
96299	of travel for something that is built
99780	into something so thin so I think the
102930	only solution is to take it apart and
105930	find out exactly how they did that now
108869	one thing you are sacrifice is backlit
110610	to look at that one thing you are
112439	sacrificing is that the trackpad is no
115200	longer clickable so you're gonna need to
116880	do a touch for left and a double touch
119159	like that for right but I think if
121229	you're the kind of person who is really
123149	into super thin laptops you can probably
125369	make do with that overall I was also
128098	impressed by the sturdiness so this is
129810	an aluminium unibody design and
132800	is completely fanless so how'd they do
136040	it well
136850	I took the liberty of pre removing and
140090	loosening most of the screws so I could
142820	open this baby up for you yeah this is
148970	why this is when I have the most fun at
150830	these shows popped the easiest way to do
156350	it I already tried this once was to kind
159020	of kind of give it a little bend well
164990	now it's off yeah okay so how'd they do
170750	it so about a third of the laptop maybe
174050	about 25% of it is taken up by this
176210	thirty-six watt hour battery right here
178600	it looks like that is actually two
181420	separate batteries or two separate cells
184760	it's kind of hard to tell I'm not going
186740	to get too much into the details here
188180	here's the fanless cooler so that
190400	actually got two heat pipes running from
193040	it look so it looks like the heat is
194870	gonna be dissipated through the keyboard
196700	it's not something I noticed while I was
198890	playing around with it so it clearly
200630	doesn't heat up too much but there's
202550	your CPU right there and it's basically
204530	just using like copper sheeting as a
207980	heatsink really impressive stuff our
210739	storage drive is up here so this is
213230	actually a 512 gig drive but they are
215630	planning to ship this with a 256 and
218150	then Ram is not upgradable like the SSD
221780	Ram is actually soldered right onto the
224690	motherboard it's not 100% clear where it
226970	is I'm not actually able to comment on
233270	that
233510	the last thing though that I did want to
235160	cover is that considering the thinness
236900	of this thing io is not bad you got a
239420	power button over here you've got two
242050	USB type C's and would you look at that
245300	a headphone jack huh so it turns out
249860	they can put those things on you know
252380	super thin computers so pricing is going
256310	to be 1699 us and availability is I
260298	don't know sometime in like the next
261798	little bit I actually didn't ask but
263539	there you have it
265120	so big thank you to LastPass for
267890	sponsoring this video LastPass has been
270170	a lifesaver for us for we've been using
272630	it for well over a year now company-wide
275150	and there's all kinds of things that's
277100	great for it's great for throw away
279110	sites where you sign up for an account
281360	because you like need to read that forum
284000	reply or you need to submit a warranty
286970	replacement and you know for a fact you
288830	are never gonna remember that password
291020	so your options are either to do a
292910	password reset every time which doesn't
295730	work if you're say on a plane and you
297230	don't have an internet connection or
298490	whatever else or you have to reuse a
300110	password which is literally rule number
302480	one the first thing they tell you not to
305750	do when you're trying to be secure
307370	online reusing passwords is bad or with
310340	LastPass you just have to remember one
312170	password and you can go in and it'll
314030	just Auto populate whether it's in a
315710	browser or on Android phones at least
318170	it'll actually even do it within apps so
320480	you get a new phone or whatever else you
322220	want to log into everything you just log
324290	into LastPass you fire up the app it'll
326570	go hey we detected that we can autofill
328310	this for you bippity Boppity two-factor
330560	and you're in you've got them linked in
332810	the video description but we've been
334100	really happy with the enterprise service
335930	that we've had so thanks for watching
338060	guys if you just like this video then
339950	you can hit that button but if you liked
341540	it hit that like button get subscribed
344120	or maybe consider checking out I don't
346940	know subscribe check out our other CES
348590	2018 content it's gonna be awesome is
354410	that PCB even like thinner than usual
356600	like the keyboard just goes right
358160	through this is it that's the keyboard
