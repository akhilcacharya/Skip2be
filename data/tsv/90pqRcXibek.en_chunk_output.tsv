6680	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9599	what is clearly a pre-production retail
12630	package because I don't think
14219	coolermaster with all of their
16500	experience would release our retail
18690	product that looked like this but this
21449	is pretty much what you'll get inside
23160	your real one with a more fancy graphic
25050	on it this is the Quickfire TK so if you
28560	didn't know already coolermaster has
30990	been doing mechanical keyboards for a
32820	little while now actually so they are
35579	quite well-regarded they have a pretty
37890	wide variety of products I mean you look
39629	at some companies where they'll release
41850	sort of one mechanical keyboard with one
44850	particular key switch and maybe it has a
46829	backplate or it doesn't have a backlight
48300	you should be happy to get what you can
50460	I suppose I'm cool masters taking a
52800	completely different approach and
54090	they're going after more like the guys
55410	who do a lot of different skills with a
57180	lot of customizability so the Quickfire
59489	TK alone is available in cherry MX blue
63000	cherry MX red switches and cherry MX
65909	brown switches they also come with
68340	different backlight colors to correspond
70380	to the types of switches in them so this
72240	I asked for if you know if you guys
74729	follow me on Twitter and you know what I
76290	think of keyboards I ask for obviously
78750	the Cherry MX blue version Oh check that
81360	out it's oh oh hold on up there it is
85310	alright I thought we were going to be
87090	missing a key there oh well this is a
88500	good opportunity to show you guys what
89939	it what it looks like so there you can
91770	see the Cherry MX blue switch you can
94200	hear if I move it up to the mic oh yeah
97710	you can hear the sexy sound that it
100079	makes when you actually actuate the
101549	switch I'm just going to go ahead and
102630	throw that back on it comes with a key
104280	removal tool right so so yes this is the
107549	blue version with a blue backlight and a
110700	blue and blue switches I'm just going to
113040	show you guys how this works so it comes
115140	with a removable cable which I don't
117299	know if I I don't know if that's
118259	entirely necessary but I guess if that's
120180	something they want to do then that's
121140	great it also has cable routing holes so
123540	you can bring it out to one side bring
125820	it out the other side or bring it
127320	straight out the back of the keyboard
128250	depending on what you find preferable
129929	there are rubber non-slip
133590	here here and here and the all this
135330	isn't these are my favorite check this
136470	out so if you get right in there you can
138209	see the entire both sides of it or
140730	rubber so it's an entire coating on the
143430	keyboard little foot itself here that's
145739	rubber so what that means is a lot of
147660	the time you deploy these things and the
149670	keyboard becomes slippery all of a
151349	sudden because only the bottom two are
152849	making contact properly and these will
154440	be just plastic cooler masters gone the
156660	extra mile and made sure that that's not
158310	going to cause any problems for you
160170	comes with a key removal tool so you can
162840	go ahead and remove the keys you can
164280	remove the keys without the key removal
166260	tool but it's not recommended because it
168690	can damage the switch underneath so
171420	let's go ahead and check this out so
172680	there you go you can see the blue the
174630	blue backplate it has a full metal
176220	backplate so let's find it
178200	well that's very solid actually this is
180329	among the more solid keyboards that I've
182220	encountered even some mechanical
184230	keyboards you can tell these they're
186209	still they're not that solidly built
187799	because they'll have a lot of flex in
189090	them but you can see I'm actually
190530	putting a lot of force on this can you
192030	can you see the Flex there's a little
193620	bit but I mean there's only so much you
195090	can do but it's very very solidly built
197489	that makes a great difference when
200489	you're mashing on something pressing
202380	buttons hard to have it not have any
204569	flex to it because that's how you get
206280	that sort of that perfect tactile
208319	response now blue switches are not for
210870	everyone you can hear how loud they are
214760	but like I said Coolermaster is making
217590	the keyboard available in a variety of
219150	different configurations depending on
220709	what you want the brown switch one does
222540	not come with a brown backlight just so
224849	you guys know so the blue switch one
226650	comes with a blue backlight the red
228419	switch one comes with a red backlight
229889	and the brown switch one comes with a
231900	white backlight so don't worry it's
233970	nothing nothing ridiculous like that and
236700	you know what this might be a bit of a
239099	bit of a problem here because oh no it
242340	works there we go I was worried that it
243959	wouldn't work because I'm not actually
245430	booted into Windows but it looks like
246870	all the software is running in here so
248700	the keys are individually backlight
250590	backlit and it comes with a variety of
253620	mode so you can see the mode here for
255510	whatever reason has these ones not
257130	illuminated and this will not eliminate
259470	it and the f12 not illuminated it also
261089	has three different brightness levels so
262500	I'm just going to hold down function
264270	here and so we'll go brightness all the
266640	way down
269280	Wow five different brightness levels you
272229	know what that looks stunning look how
274389	good the backlight looks when they can
276129	see here if I unplug it so unplug it
278560	again you can see they've colored the
280360	backplate blue which means the
282159	reflection of the LEDs off the backplate
284229	actually makes the blue much more
286360	intense and much more striking then
288430	keyboards that I've seen in the past
289690	that is a really nice touch that's smart
291789	I haven't seen that before so let's give
294069	it a sec - oh yeah I plugged it into the
296319	right thing okay so give this a sec to
298210	turn itself back on here so give me a
301389	moment so I managed to lock up the
303789	computer because I realize it was doing
306129	something and I was mashing on he's over
307930	here and it was obviously plugged in so
309699	I'm going to not mash keys too too hard
311889	anymore but I want to show you guys so
313389	it has five different brightness levels
315460	it has several different modes so that
318639	looks like sort of more of like an okay
320650	so there's WASD mode then there's sort
325810	of full mode except for the function key
327759	here and these keys right here
329560	and then there's sort of what looks like
331750	kind of a oh is it like pulsating or
334330	something oh cool it has like a
337180	breathing mode that's that's really neat
338979	okay and then brightness you obviously
341979	can't control in that particular mode
343509	I'm not sure what this guy does back in
345130	a sec okay I figured it out so I think
348430	I've got a got everything down pat oh
350229	this switch is between six key and n key
352509	roll over remember and key rollover is
354310	better because it means you can type
357009	like this if you want and it'll actually
358750	register every single keystroke no big
362289	deal six key rollover however is more
365409	compatible with various bios's or with
368409	Apple computers for example that don't
370330	support any key rollover because this is
371740	over USB which normally sort of
374770	naturally doesn't support any key
376779	rollover all right next we've got I
379719	could not figure out for the life of me
381490	why these keys weren't illuminating
382750	number lock so when you have number lock
385569	off you can see these arrow keys
387310	illuminate because we are in the mode
389289	that allows us to use the other
390490	functionality of this of this block of
393099	keys here so we've got a full number pad
396190	block which I personally still like to
398110	see but we have a keyboard that's not
400029	much
400590	than a 10 kilos which is really cool so
403350	by switching this functionality so
405390	number lock is on other functionality is
407820	on you got all your usual keys and page
410730	down page up delete all that good stuff
412890	and you have a full number pad just very
415740	very cool right here this is a function
418410	key lock so this is uh this okay however
423330	this works okay one of them is oh sorry
425220	windows key locks so you can turn your
426720	windows keys on and off and this is your
428850	function key lock which will lock your
430830	function keys on and off so that you can
433020	either have them operate as f1 to f12 or
435960	you can have them operate as dedicated
438390	media keys including play pause stop
440220	back forward mute volume down and volume
443610	up as well as all of your lighting
446310	adjustments and all that good stuff so
448020	you can go sort of I think we showed all
450270	the different lighting modes I think
452730	that pretty much covers it so thank you
455280	for checking out my unboxing your first
456930	look at the very well built very solid
459450	feeling I mean there's you know the
460620	whole CM storm thing they've just got
462360	good little touches that make it look
465300	nice make it function well and that
468870	pretty much covers it as you guys know
470430	I'm big into mechanical keyboards would
472290	I recommend this one absolutely don't
474390	forget to subscribe science tech tips
475680	for unboxings reviews and other computer
