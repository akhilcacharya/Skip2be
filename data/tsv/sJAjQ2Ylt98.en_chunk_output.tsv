30	now I always liked the concept of the Z
2399	board or the Zed board but honestly the
4830	build quality always felt a little while
7760	suspect to me
9360	now what SteelSeries did in their
11519	acquisition of ideas on is they took
13349	some of the products particularly the Z
15509	board and just made them better beefier
19350	stronger faster just better in sort of
23460	every way so that's where the shift
25439	comes from it actually accepts the same
28410	key sets as the Z board so if you have
30420	an old Z board key set you can throw it
32159	right onto a shift key board and vice
34050	versa you can buy a shift key set for
36210	your old Z board no problem but they
39239	just really improve the base station of
42420	it a great deal so I've actually done an
45420	unboxing of the shift already so you can
47160	check that one out on my channel if you
48629	want to this is specifically going to be
50879	about the World of Warcraft Cataclysm
53010	key set for the Z board so I have a Z
57329	board so well is for the Z board but
58710	it's mostly for the shift okay so here
60030	we go this box includes well here why
63239	don't we start opening it and then we'll
65040	talk about what it includes so let's see
66810	if there's any features on the back that
68250	stand out um no doesn't really look like
71640	there's anything there that I don't
72960	already know so I guess I'll just go
76259	ahead and start getting this thing
78900	opened up so you can see it comes with
80939	the default key set installed yeah and
84360	I'm just going to show you guys as part
86310	of this unboxing so we got a sticker
87900	product guide yep little baggie of stuff
91979	there we've got a SteelSeries shift key
95130	board here which is taped closed so
99380	remove that tape take out the keyboard
107450	all right then
111290	sorry guys are having cousin cover
113670	logistics okay
116330	so shift keyboard let's go over this
118560	really quick even though we've kind of
120960	already done it okay media keys here
122940	very nice keyboard layout that I like a
125430	lot
125970	full-size backspace full-size shift keys
127890	all of that good stuff
129270	you got your f keys you got your
131070	programmable keys up here including a
132840	record button and three different
134040	profiles okay you've got all of your
137820	other sort of normal stuff over here
139830	number pad print screen scroll lock okay
142230	so well that's normal except BAM whoa
145110	it's all gone so if you haven't seen a Z
148290	board or a shift before then there you
150240	are that's the concept of the shift
152990	removable key sets okay so it includes
155850	our wrist rest and I'm not going to get
158760	too far into that you can check out my
160459	my other shift unboxing if you want to
163080	see the wrist rest and it includes a
165600	cataclysm reset here we are
168350	so the cataclysm key set comes wrapped
171510	in plastic and the first thing we're
174120	going to do is show you how easy it is
175680	to install a key set on the ship you
178260	just slide it in like that lay the whole
180750	thing down and clip it in on the side
183739	there we are now it's in that was easy
186930	so all of this stuff over here that is
189810	not for gaming I mean maybe some people
191820	buying things to insert gaming functions
195720	although most people probably don't okay
197850	so not for gaming replaces all that
200190	stuff with for gaming okay so here
203070	everything over here is fairly normal
205590	except they've changed a lot of the
207330	labels so check this out
208560	so tab is now the oh really it's not
212370	going to focus on me alright let's see
214739	if we can get it to focus please focus
218209	I'll have to read it for you tab is the
221220	target nearest enemy button for example
224190	okay so there's a lot of stuff here
225840	there's enemy plates and then with the
228060	shift friendly plates there's backpack
230430	shift is all bags talent map skills
233130	quest social spell book action ten
236459	action 9 all kinds of stuff here so the
238709	F ones okay emote bar one you move bar
241049	two so thank you cheer welcome charge
243750	congrats in
244920	humming all good stuff here pet pat one
248670	pet to pet three pet for all right and
250920	then over here this is the gaming area
253800	of the keyboard gaming terrain alright
257339	so we've got complete replacement for
259769	WASD okay so if you want to run using
264000	this over here then you can totally do
266010	that
266250	we've got nah okay well you I guess the
273330	way this is set up you would not use
276300	this with your left hand the way you
281130	would for FPS games okay so you're going
283139	to use this with your right hand and
284669	then this with your left hand okay I
286979	don't quite understand how this works
288300	give me a moment see this is the problem
290250	with doing these videos like completely
292320	off the top of my head okay so this this
294510	is pretty clearly not not a replacement
297750	for WASD so WASD are your movement keys
301290	over here is a whole bunch of
303419	supplementary stats of got screenshot
305370	exit vehicle inspect invite trade raid
308910	okay here's all your raid functions so
311010	raid chat ready check raid warning raid
313350	browser hey chat functions so you got
315930	party chat guild chat region chat BG
318120	chat say whisper yell emote so these are
320640	all useful things to have automatically
322890	bound okay and most of these are keys
327390	that you would already normally find on
329310	a keyboard so check this out okay so
331039	right here delete also has a delete key
335700	over here now it looks like it's changed
339720	the actual location of it so what would
342060	have normally been print screen right
345270	here actually corresponds to insert so
348600	they've changed the layout slightly but
351090	the the the circuitry in the key set
356520	itself is going to remap that for you
358710	without you having to worry too much
360030	about it so pretty much that's it the
362910	point of the shift keyboard is this okay
366300	it's basically like a Z board except
368520	just generally built better and thank
371940	you for checking out my unboxing of the
