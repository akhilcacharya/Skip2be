26240	oh I lost okay so I've been asked for a
31419	demonstration video of the OCZ
34220	Nia or a neural impulse actuator and so
39110	this is a bit of a practical
40850	demonstration of how the nia can allow
44330	me to control this paddle using what a
48530	control that they call tension so I
50480	found I'm able to control my tension not
53480	very well while I'm talking but I can
55489	usually control my tension either by
57350	raising my brow or lowering it or also
61040	by by clenching my jaw so that allows me
67520	to control the paddle and direct the
71570	ball back towards the computer player
73610	using only like only like actions and
79580	and thoughts there's actually some other
82369	pretty cool stuff in here and I just
83960	wanted to show you this one this is part
85970	of their driver so I tried a few things
88939	and I wish I'd done this on camera cuz
91640	it was pretty neat but one of the things
93259	that I tried was eating and I found that
95600	when I when I was eating my whole brain
97880	kind of went nuts and all of the all of
100280	the different brain waves all maxed out
103369	but ok some of the controls that you can
106189	use with the Nia to control your games
108049	are attention so I found ways to control
111710	that I think it's different for for
113329	everybody another one is glance so it's
116359	easy recommends using glance and here at
119240	cameraman come out and have a look at me
120530	so what glance does is here if I look
122929	straight ahead glance should zero out
125509	can you see glance in the background
126969	make it so you can see glance in the
129080	background ok so I'm going to stare
130669	straight into the camera now watch I'm
132170	going to look a little bit to the left
133400	of the camera glance goes up and then if
137840	I look to the right then glance will
139760	also go up now the Nia can actually tell
142340	whether I'm glancing left or right so
144530	ocz recommends setting glance to strafe
146900	left and strafe right and then they
148910	recommend using tension to control your
150770	forward movement now I haven't found
152959	I've only been playing with it for a
154160	little while I haven't found ways to
155420	control the alpha waves or the beta
157610	waves but
158450	you can actually configure those to
161120	control other things as well and when
162800	you're playing me upon you can this is a
165620	good practice because you can use glance
168290	alpha 1 2 3 or beta 1 2 3 or attention
171110	to control the paddle so if I use glance
176120	if I glanced more if I look around more
179180	the paddle raises up and if I look
181519	straight ahead the paddle goes down so
185180	that's the NIA it hooks up to your head
187310	and then to your computer and you can
189500	use it to to control things so that was
192680	my my demonstration video I don't think
194930	I'm good enough with it yet to do a game
196940	demo but hopefully that will be coming
198860	sometime in the future it's definitely a
201010	very cool device something very
203450	different
