30	so you bought yourself an ergonomic
1800	keyboard spending not only hundreds of
4019	dollars but also countless hours trying
6420	to master typing on the darn thing but
8820	like that's fine I guess right you can't
11070	put a price on health but hold on a
13920	minute what happens when you're not at
16859	your regular desk most of the ergonomic
19109	keyboards that we've tested have been
21300	large and cumbersome enough that you
23130	wouldn't want to travel with them so
25529	what you're just doomed to aggravate
27660	your repetitive strain injury haha no my
30869	friends for there is a light at the end
33450	of your carpal tunnel introducing yogi
37710	type the foldable organ AMA keyboard but
42660	is this thing a direct path to keyboard
45420	nirvana or is it more like downward dogs
49730	speaking of nirvana today's video is
52020	brought to you by tonal bear tunnel bear

71850	the yoga type comes in a bougie carrying
74770	case that will absolutely make people
76630	want to be your friend and inside you'll
78550	find the bass wrist pads and the keypad
81280	set up is a snap at first it might seem
84910	like you're typing upside-down or
86920	something since you're looking at the
88660	underside of the keyboard as you type
90910	but actually the yoga type is kind of
94090	like the safe type keyboard that we
95920	checked out before except on steroids
99270	the main idea of having a vertically
102399	standing keyboard like this is to
104259	prevent what's called pronation that's
106960	when the two bones in your forearm
108880	crisscross pinching tissue and blood
111460	vessels of course though having the keys
114280	on the side makes them harder to see and
117060	let's be honest even the touchy stuff
120369	touch typists we'll look at the keyboard
123149	sometimes but instead of Genki rearview
126550	mirrors the inward angle of the key
128739	modules allowed yogi types creators to
130869	implement a much more elegant visual aid
133180	colored LEDs and you can even switch
136600	them off if you prefer and this angle
139600	has some economic benefits as well
141640	helping with extension and finger
144489	relaxation speaking of relaxation the
147280	included wrist pads are super cushy easy
151000	to adjust and the best part is they
153340	slide so they don't inhibit your natural
156190	movements this is so much better than
159070	having to hold your arms up the whole
161200	time like on the safe type my only gripe
164410	is that you can't adjust their height
166420	and I think that they're a little bit
168160	too tall to fully alleviate the last
170830	economic pitfall ulnar deviation okay so
174970	this is all quite positive so far but
177220	what's it like to actually type on this
179620	thing well at first it wasn't too bad
183100	since they've got tactile guides for
185019	both your index and pinky fingers as
187660	well as this sort of inexplicable one on
190299	the 8ki and most of the keys are in the
193810	same relative position as they are on a
196120	regular keyboard most of them
199389	I mean hey I get it this is
201870	ten keyless board and there's no room
203909	for keys on the foldable base so you're
206340	just gonna have to get used to the more
208650	obscure keys like home and and having
211620	new homes on the end but what about non
215519	obscure keys they moved the apostrophe
218760	key to no man's land and backspace a key
222659	that I use a lot more than I'd like to
224819	admit though probably still less than I
227159	should has been moved to right beside
229290	the P key which means that when you make
232290	a mistake typing on this strange new
234390	keyboard you have to rectify it by using
236940	your pinky in unfamiliar territory which
239760	often leads to making even more mistakes
241799	making you so unproductive that you just
244140	end up putting the yogi type in a bin
245549	under your desk for two weeks while you
247349	review other stuff but Linus backspace
251310	has to go somewhere doesn't it well of
253409	course it does and my vote is to take
256350	over some of that spacebar real estate
258449	this would not only flatten the learning
260728	curve but also make it more ergonomic
263010	since you have way more power up here
265229	than you do with your little finger but
267260	I'm actually not going to stop there
269789	as is the space keys are positioned to
272280	be pressed with the base of your finger
273930	which works and it's actually kind of
275880	innovative but it does disrupt your
278580	index fingers ability to continue typing
280770	so our preference would be to strike the
283680	space and backspace keys with the thumb
286590	like you do on the Kinesis advantage -
288690	or the erga docks except that these
291120	bloody joysticks are in the way not that
293820	thumb sticks are a bad idea inherently
297060	so these are for controlling the mouse
299220	cursor page scrolling and right and left
301889	clicks you can even switch between left
304229	and right-handed mouse configurations
306030	right on the board and I'm positive that
308849	there are some users out there who need
311130	to be able to do that from a neutral
312810	position the problem is that the mouse
315810	is effectively unusable it has crazy
318960	acceleration unruly steering and I'm not
321930	sure if our right stick is broken but we
324570	had trouble moving it at all without
326340	highlighting everything if they insist
328650	on keeping the onboard mouse I would
330990	suggest replacing the joysticks with
333440	marble-sized trackball
335249	or something like how cool would that be
337109	one last complaint did anybody else
340439	notice that the keys on this side are
342869	staggered and the keys on this side are
346019	all aligned WTF anyway should you buy
354119	this keyboard then at about a three
356519	hundred and fifty dollars it's $60 more
360119	than the awful safe type but is better
363899	in just about every way including the
365759	switches this one is way less mushy
368009	though with that said the advantage to
371039	is the same price is mechanical and
374009	though it doesn't fold up it is portable
377249	in the sense that all the macros and the
379499	layouts that you program onto it are
381509	saved on board so I wouldn't say that it
386279	sucks but the yogi type has enough small
389519	things wrong with it at this point that
391499	giving it our full endorsement would be
393779	a bit of a stretch which can't be said
