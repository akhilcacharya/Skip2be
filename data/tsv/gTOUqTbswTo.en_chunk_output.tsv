60	you know this probably happens to
1469	everyone all the time they're sitting
3419	there making a YouTube video pretending
5730	to play a video game for b-roll and
7560	though the wire gets caught on something
9690	I'm like you know what just screw this I
11460	hate it all
13460	fortunately the solution arrived today
17990	this is a special care package for love
21810	taken look at this special care package
25260	from Logitech that includes their new
28010	g9o 3 and g7o 3 mice and perhaps more
33809	importantly because this is Canada after
36840	all it includes what Logitech is calling
39809	the power play but it's not a hockey
43829	power play it's totally different with
46829	the power play these wireless mice can
50280	be used indefinitely without ever
54710	plugging them in I was going to say holy
59010	 but I got distracted because
61829	they're making
63750	[Music]
71400	Brow's privately and securely with
74650	tunnel there the simple VPN app try
77650	tunnel bear for free at the link in the
79930	video description so step number one
83020	would be to decide which mouth I'm going
85180	to use that's pretty simple this one is
88300	a hundred dollars and this one is a
91060	hundred and fifty dollars so I'm going
93670	to use the more expensive one because
96600	that's how you know you get the best
98680	stuff you just get the one that's more
100660	expensive then I need to set up the
105400	wireless charging power play we've got
109600	all our cables and dongles and pucks and
112510	mice and everything on box we're going
114790	to take off the packaging here now to be
117580	clear the plan is to follow this up with
119650	a full more in-depth review but today
123400	was all about wanting to see this in
126820	action because this isn't the first time
129429	that wireless charging has been brought
132790	to market I mean inform factors like
135250	this this is this is just a phone
136810	backing this is not a real wireless
138370	charging case but inform factors like
140470	this you could get like phone wireless
142959	charging docks but there's a bit of a
145090	problem right because a you have to
147459	position them like just right and then
149380	you get the icon and it starts charging
151030	it's kind of a pain in the butt and B I
152980	mean can you imagine having something
155230	that size you know under you know
158050	obviously not that's stupid and while
161350	this isn't even the first time that
164260	we've seen a company talk about wireless
167110	charging for a mouse this is the first
171130	time it's been turned into a real
173290	product something that you can actually
176200	okay not order today but you can
178959	pre-order today so our kit actually came
182140	with three of these cables this is
183820	actually kind of neat because the
185620	powerplay actually uses the same
188850	microUSB cables as logitech wireless
191709	mice so you plug that in and three
194680	things happen boom RGB lighting that's
197769	number one most important number two
201020	is yes so under that mousepad under that
205400	mousepad
206060	right there the powerplay mousing
210350	surface gets activated you can actually
212960	see some of the circuitry down there and
215960	number three is it actually eliminates
219890	the need for your wireless mouse dongle
223460	that's what's really cool about this
225710	unlike other wireless charging solutions
228080	the powerplay managed to fit into a 2
232600	millimeter thin form factor and it's got
237350	other advantages as well so
239390	theoretically over pretty much the
241730	entire surface here you are going to get
244610	not like a full-fledged you know one amp
248780	or 2 amp charge like you might be able
251000	to with a like a phone charger or
252980	something like that
253670	but you're going to be able to power up
256160	the mouse including all its RGB lighting
258649	and high performance wireless interface
261230	so these mic both of them are actually
263870	higher performing than many of logitech
266630	competitors wired mice in terms of the
269510	time to click to the time that an action
271580	takes place on screen we've seen this in
273320	their lab and we've seen this at tech
275180	shows but also all their RGB effects and
278690	all of that bullcrap so let's go ahead
283160	and throw one of these mouse pads the
285590	Logitech actually ships it with a couple
287870	of options they've got one of their hard
289580	pads and they've got one of their soft
293000	pads here so I'm going to use the soft
295070	pad because that's my personal
296210	preference they've only validated the
298520	technology with their mouth pads but
301430	theoretically there's no real reason why
303890	it couldn't work with some other random
305750	mouse pad as long as it's the right size
307790	oh yeah and there's another important
311120	piece that you need so this is a tech
313160	that Logitech says they're going to
314810	support moving forward so you just press
317180	that in and pop this out but all you've
319940	got to do is take the power play puck
322070	which uses magnets and a couple of
324050	contact points here it's oriented like
326600	that for your convenience plug that in
330380	and give you this pairing lhasa yo did
347900	you open it I told you this was for me
350750	to open okay first of all I don't have
356030	anything else
356840	hey no defense no defense whatsoever IDI
360560	couldn't keep his grubby fingers off of
362360	this and you're a big G 403 fanboy so
365030	you paired it with the 703 didn't you
367430	yes it is not explained so I didn't work
373120	all right well thanks Edie
376220	so the pairing process is supposed to be
378710	out of the box as simple as plugging in
381410	the pad whereupon it will enter a
383450	pairing mode instead of being RGB
385430	cycling and then you just pop the
388250	powerplay in flip on the mouse and boom
390980	you should be instantly paired and
392870	enjoying your complete and utter
395050	wireless freedom for that that was the
399740	experience we were supposed to have egg
404830	next step then I guess is to grab the
407990	Logitech Gaming software and actually
410300	find out if I sit here in game will my
415940	mouse charged or will it discharge no no
422660	discharge doesn't have to be a gross
424040	thing okay so let's get a baseline for
427070	our half an hour battery test we're
428840	looking at about 56% on the battery and
431750	what's cool is we can use this time not
434900	just to sit here and play video games
436040	but also to tell you guys a little bit
438770	more about the tech because the neatest
440420	thing about this is that even actively
443360	using the device we should be going back
445970	to Windows after half an hour or even
448130	more not just not having lost battery
452990	because it can power the mouse but we
454940	may even see a little bit of charge
457760	because it can actually do it while you
460550	are moving the mouse
461460	this is totally different from other
463710	wireless charging solution Logitech
466080	actually draws some parallels to the way
468090	that early radios worked so it's not
470160	quite the same thing but what they had
472229	in them was crystals that they used as
474569	rectifiers and what they could do is
477060	they could actually take the incoming
478620	radio signal that would have your you
480599	know sporting event or your war of the
482729	worlds' or whatever I'll phone it and
484710	they could use that not just to create
487020	sound but also to power up the device
490110	cool thing number two is the way that
492780	they're handling battery management
494250	because if you guys are familiar with
496410	lithium-ion batteries you may already
498509	know this having them constantly
500970	charging can actually be really bad for
503699	them so since the mouse has a battery
506639	built into it what Logitech does is they
508919	actually let it go between 80% and 95%
513390	of charge this does a couple of things
515849	number one is it keeps the battery
518969	healthy and number two if it keeps it
522179	free going so low that you wouldn't even
524459	have the option of you know grabbing
526290	your wireless dongle and taking your
528690	mouse with you on the go in class or
531120	something and that's critical because
532920	there is a pretty extensive list of do's
535709	and dont's that come along with a
537570	product like this this is not your
540270	ordinary mouse pad in fact there aren't
542490	a lot of do's there are mostly a lot of
544350	don't you don't want to use it on
546630	anything other than a flat surface you
549420	don't want to plug it into a USB hub
551550	unless it's a powered one you want to
553890	avoid using it on a metal or conductive
556740	surface like if you had a metal table
558810	for example you want to avoid putting
561029	any metal or magnetic objects on top of
563520	it that includes fidget spinners you'll
565350	have to move your fitting spinner a
566579	little over to the right or a little up
568440	here with that said though plastic
570779	things like CDs should be just fine you
574500	don't want to hold on I'm going to
576060	consult my list you don't want to fold
578730	it that's critical because the delicate
581880	antenna system inside here could be
585500	extraordinarily easily broken as we know
590610	because in my eagerness to
594089	unbox this thing I actually managed to
596490	break our first one I mean if you needed
603540	any further evidence that no matter how
605910	cool and wireless your gaming mouse is
607709	not going to make you a better gamer
609059	than here you go you've got this video
611519	but that's hardly the point it's the end
614699	of the day let's go ahead and tap out to
616800	Windows and okay so we didn't get any
620129	more charge using the mouse really
623730	actively but over a period of time where
627509	it should have gone down by about 3% we
630990	didn't lose any either so there you have
633870	it guys you saw it here in action
636389	logitech power play actual wireless
640709	charging with zero compromises other
