0	fresh books is the number one cloud
1740	accounting software a custom built for
3240	the way that you want to work for your
5009	free unrestricted 30-day trial go to
6720	fresh books calm slash Linus CES and
9480	speaking of number one this is my
10679	favorite case of the show so far it has
13440	such beautiful steel that I thought it
15299	was aluminum for like a while then
17369	there's tempered glass on the front and
19020	on the side this front is a really cool
21060	custom reservoir by der Bauer who worked
23970	in collaboration on this case but the
26550	one that you get if you buy it will show
28320	up as a clean tempered glass clear front
31050	panel ok but why is it that special well
34770	the price if you get it with no fans is
36660	one $29.99 if you get it with three RGB
40290	fans with aluminum frames it's one 59:19
43829	all the panels on this case are tooless
45989	although to remove them you'll have to
47760	remove the top one first it has two
49559	captive thumb screws on the back that
51750	you can just slide it back and lift it
53579	right off for now we're gonna remove the
56520	back panel this guy has two big meshed
59730	filtered breathing holes this one on the
61890	left here is for the radiator that could
63960	be attached to the three fans that are
65519	in the front and this one on the right
67170	hand side is for your power supply and
69420	your hard drives but the power supply
72630	and hard drive positions can switch
74340	around and be changed so you could have
75720	two power supplies in here if you wished
77490	and you took away this hard drive
79500	mounting location or like I expect most
82439	people will have it configured is like
84090	it is now or with these positions
85560	swapped now this hard drive Bay you can
87689	access them through the back through
89340	this little panel that's back here it's
90990	just one more thumb screw which can be
92820	two lessly removed and then you can
95040	actually slide out the trays through the
97259	back so everything is nicely accessible
99600	well we're back here I'd like to draw
101220	attention to this large plate in the
103140	middle you can mount one three and a
105119	half inch drive up here or one two and a
107189	half inch drive and a little bit lower
108750	down you can mount also another two and
110909	a half inch drive those drives would go
112110	on the inside so you actually close the
113820	case but you can remove the plate with
116219	the two screws up here or one screw down
118020	here in order to mount those drives
119820	before you put it inside and it doubles
122340	as a way to hide your potential cable
125460	mess if you decided to be a little bit
126899	lazy in terms of front i/o you have a
128520	power button two USB three type-a ports
131038	a headphone
131760	microphone jack and USB type-c port and
134459	that is all mounted onto a brushed
136409	aluminum plate which is great because
138390	all the areas that you're really going
139709	to be focusing on when you look at this
141269	case the front and the inside are
143760	covered by tempered glass and aluminum I
145890	mentioned earlier how you could buy the
147150	O 11 dynamic with three RGB fans
149700	included that brings us to their update
151980	of their Borah line of fans we're gonna
154530	start with the Borah plus 120 a three
157260	kit of these with their addressable RGB
159659	version which you can control through
161220	their custom software with a whole bunch
163049	of different lighting modes including
164700	CPU usage levels CPU temperature levels
167640	drive temperatures and a ton of other
169889	stuff is $99 for the three fan kit and
173040	the controller now if you step down from
175230	there get the same three awesome fans
177389	but it's you it's managed by an external
180000	physical controller that's $69.99 for
183060	the three fans and the controller and
184650	then if you step down from there again
186629	we're not going to low end fans we're
188430	just going to a step down from the Borah
190620	plus you get what I'm going to call and
193109	they've been kind of saying around here
194609	the Borah light but that is not the
196169	official name for it and that's this guy
198269	I actually personally to possibly their
201090	dismay think that it might look better
202739	because the RGB is on the inside the
205410	LEDs I should say on the inside are
207930	actually hidden by the middle sticker
209310	and it looks like the fan is just
211019	glowing from nothing which i think is
212790	really cool that is managed by your
214980	motherboard through just a simple PWM
217109	connector and is $39 for three of them
220230	the O 11 dynamic and the new Borah fans
223319	are both cheaper than I expected much
225569	more affordable than I expected I
226919	thought this case was going to be closer
228540	to 200 $250 speaking of affordability
231660	and managing money fresh books is the
