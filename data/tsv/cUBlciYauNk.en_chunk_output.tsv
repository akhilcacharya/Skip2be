0	thanks to iFixit for sponsoring this
1650	video check out their pro tect toolkit
3510	at ifixit.com forward slash Lynas for
6540	free solid generations digital storm has
9780	been making their small form-factor
11550	gaming computers bigger and bigger for
15570	some inexplicable reason but that all
17609	changes today they're showing off the
19859	Modena the event MX and the V locks X
23039	and those ones are pretty cool but this
25849	this is the star of the show this is the
29070	digital storm spark the kind of small
32460	form-factor gaming machine that I might
34350	have designed after I first laid eyes on
36600	many STX hardware back at Computex last
40050	year so inside this tiny box like look
43440	at this this is an event of extra scale
45629	like come on inside this tiny box you'll
49350	find tons of storage expansion that is
51600	three MDOT two slots and a two and a
55350	half inch drive bay you will find up to
58199	a core i7 8700 K you will find up to a
62579	gtx 1080 graphics card up to 32 gigs of
66960	ram and yes my friends that is full
70369	custom hardline water cooling with RGB
74640	lighting so they've done a couple of
76920	cool things to get that kind of hardware
78810	into this form factor number one is they
81900	have actually worked with Swift tech to
84299	design a custom block for the MXM
87420	graphics card that is used by this mini
90479	STX form factor number two is they're
93689	using super compact 92 millimeter
97229	radiator up here in the top as well as a
99780	one of the smallest pump reservoir
102390	combos that I have ever seen up there
105509	and number three is that they've
107909	designed their own custom chassis which
110670	by the time this is released in knock on
113490	wood quarter 2 of 2018
115530	will have tempered glass for the side
117810	panels on both sides it's digital storm
121469	so it's not going to be cheap once it's
123840	available you'll be able to customize
125159	not just the color of your coolant but
127829	even the color of the chassis with any
129869	one of their great paint jobs and while
132900	it's
133710	storm so this thing is not gonna be
136890	cheap if you're a gamer on the go and
139170	you don't like the laptop paradigm this
142470	looks like a pretty compact option this
148200	video from CES was brought to you guys
150210	by iFixit yes my friends at his courtesy
153300	of iFixit and their Pro Tech tool kit
155910	that I am able to cause the usual havoc
158640	that I do here at the show taking apart
161070	everyone's prototypes be they desktops
163470	laptops hell why don't we take apart a
166080	monitor this year I mean the sky's the
167820	limit because it's got everything from
169530	pry tools to sputters to suction cups to
172740	their 64 bit driver kit that means that
175350	you will never get stumped by a random
178350	screw that you just don't have that bit
180750	on you right now as long as you don't
183120	lose them so check them out at the link
