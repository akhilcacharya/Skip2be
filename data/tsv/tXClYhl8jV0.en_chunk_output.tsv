1500	Corsair Vengeance k70 and k95 these
4319	fully mechanical keyboards are designed
6060	for performance gaming visit Corsair
8099	comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
9870	more this will be an extremely short
12000	unboxing for what is a very simple
13920	product so I bought one of these because
16079	on our weekly live stream I want okay
20730	then I'm very durable though she's good
24570	on our weekly live stream I want to play
26609	Super Nintendo games I want to play them
28260	off of a computer because that just
30240	works better for me I own the cartridge
31859	but no gray area emulation whatever so
35399	this thing is going to allow me to do
37590	that this is the retro link mmm very
40350	descriptive dual controller port adapter
42860	compatible with original and third-party
45329	asset II it looks exactly like that it's
48660	almost like the picture is supposed to
49770	be the product dual ports for two-player
52140	gaming
52770	check that out dual ports connects to a
54840	PC or Mac via USB cable check that out
58079	that is a USB cable three foot long
60420	cable that is a three foot long cable
62579	compact and easy to use and it is USB 2
65220	so it both connects to a PC or a Mac via
68310	USB and it is USB 2 unbelievable ok so
74100	let's go back to the product itself
75330	player 1 is clearly labeled player 2 is
78299	clearly labeled so the alpha-male plugs
80369	in here and the beta male plugs in here
82409	but not at the same time that's this my
87090	friends is how hard the setup process is
89070	plug your controllers into the retro
91409	link plug the retro links USB plug into
94979	a port on your computer then without any
97110	driver installation whatsoever it
99240	automatically detected everything you
100979	can see there's two different
102000	controllers in there and you can also
104060	which one there we go you can also see
106530	your D pads working all your buttons are
108509	working for both of the controllers then
110520	you fire up your favorite game whatever
113670	it happens to be and of course you own
115320	the original console game because as
118409	much as emulation may be a gray area I
120990	personally feel it's not nearly as bad
123000	as long as you own the original game to
124920	dust off before you play and then
127259	hopefully you're gonna win I think I'm
129300	gonna win this one I'm up 3-2 so as
