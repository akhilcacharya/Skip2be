172340	seen this keyboard yes few times which
175940	one is this so this is all of them
178250	essentially this is the one that was in
179660	the mineral oil video this is the one
181250	that I repaired is one with all the
184010	signatures on the back yep yep
185630	so it's bare right now but all the
187100	signatures come in later okay I do like
189799	the ducky style feet though bro let's
191480	talk seriously for a minute very good
193790	well they all one of them is piece of
195530	4.0 divers all around up here the red
198320	part oh wow just because you didn't
200959	notice they were under the red they were
202280	under that well I'm glad you covered
203780	that for me verbally I couldn't see this
206299	is nice gold plated USB cable oh the
209600	gold plating doesn't actually help
210859	transfer speed at all all the gold
212780	plating is for is a stable connection
214489	absolutely oh let's rub against each
216709	other and make a better direction
220099	I'm sorry so I mean the gold on the
226530	outside of the connector there's there's
229049	no data you know this you know this now
231019	which is why you're laughing at you now
233310	I had looked this up at the time and
236310	found some article that was like it's
237840	better for a more stable connection and
240030	then I said it and when I wash this back
241980	like a couple days ago it's just like no
243629	no why I mean it at least you can take
248909	solace in that
250109	this was never published on the Internet

267810	of like you know what's nice and flashy
270060	you saying yeah these keys are just the
273240	ducky branding keys these can be
275370	replaced with really any of the general
277800	form factor keys on the keyboard are you
279630	not you know if you folks out there at
284909	home believe that you better go watch

385430	glute of the blue you're like still
386990	living at home here listen you this I
389090	was xx very sturdy keyboard is like some
391520	weight to it keyboard has some weight to
395720	it we're missing some gems here I mean
398000	you didn't cover the waist in part one
399950	I'm glad you're covering that it has
401330	some weight to it you're still talking
403220	about it it's very sturdy you drop it
407180	it's still around when going to a land
409340	or something that is going to be okay
410780	it's got some way to it's not just a
412520	fragile little piece of still going how
415040	many times are you gonna say about some
416330	weight to it a lot of people like it
418970	even with the numpad off of the keyboard
421940	just for spacing and all that kind of
424250	stuff on their table I like it on
425510	certain link yeah backlights mainly back
429140	the keys are awesome
430220	although ducky is in production and R&amp;D
432800	of a backlit ducky named the ducky shine
436520	there's so we're looking for five yeah I
439250	got you shine yes this is pretty
442550	defeated while this was before you could
445099	buy these in American other than
446330	imported what I want to know is why you
447889	didn't see our TV coming how you were
453169	covering stuff you didn't already fellas
454970	yeah you could hear it a lot you can
460759	hear it twice in fact you can have it
462440	explained to you twice absolutely
464000	just because you didn't get it the first
464960	line is loud also this particular model
467720	has ABS caps TBT cap sir it's pretty
471770	also mentioned before up yep like right
474940	like the first thing he says brushed
478070	though they are very what is sand rush
482470	is that cone with a brick I thought my
488840	ABS calves would hold up very well
491150	because it's not like they're low
492770	quality caps to just be cows are better
494990	like I'm doing anytime so no I don't
497690	know I don't know that I would have
499430	liked it to be backlit but really those
502669	are some pretty minor negatives other
504470	than that it's cute what's got all
506150	winners in care over USB is pretty
508070	awesome there's some one of the weight
509810	of keyboards awesome all the way the
