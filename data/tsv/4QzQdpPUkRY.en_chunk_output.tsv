0	you may have never heard a final mass
2100	the company responsible for the
4100	creatively named final Mouse but despite
7859	its obscurity the final mass that is to
10830	say the mouse and I guess by extension
13380	the company too has generated enough
16619	minds that in spite of the premium price
18779	point and lack of any sort of pedigree I
21330	not only bought into the hype and bought
23820	one before they had even announced that
25410	it was on sale but it also managed to
28710	stay out of my pile of false hope and
31590	broken dreams
41790	intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
45460	their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
49560	6600 K processors click now to learn
52870	more so where did the so-called hype
55270	come from it certainly has nothing to do
57820	with the ergonomic design the astute
60310	among you may have even noticed it's
62020	just an off-the-shelf
63340	om design you can find mice like this
66610	for ten dollars and it's exactly the
69190	same shell but let's take a tour of it
72100	anyway
73119	it has a soft touch coating for the main
75280	body a glossy plastic right side and
78130	textured plastic on the left it has a
80380	thin malleable braided cable a left like
83259	right like a screw wheel to the months
86710	and one dpi button that cycles through
89500	400 800 1600 and 3200 dpi rollers nary
94360	right yeah I know it's not but in spite
97210	of the generic appearance the inside
99250	guts do get more interesting the sensor
101680	is actually the acceleration for a 33 10
104110	that can also be found in other
106330	well-regarded than or pedigreed mice
108460	including the SteelSeries rival rocket
110979	KPM and Zowie FK 2 but there is a big
114910	difference final mass offers no
116920	customizability of dpi steps lights mun
119830	commands or polling rate because they've
122500	designed the final mouse to be genuinely
124420	driverless not like oh you can opt not
127869	use drivers but you can't change lights
129669	and stuff there's nothing you can change
132550	and no drivers you can install even if
135069	you wanted to and even the packaging is
137500	bare with just the small slip of paper
139480	with instructions and a final mass
142480	sticker this kind of sounds like a bad
145300	thing but it's actually not I'm on the
148840	mess when it was first announced and I
152080	I hated it no I wanted to hate it the
155680	build quality was terrible the buttons
157930	were loose the mass feet were poorly cut
160450	in place and the bottom of the mouse
162730	would actually catch on my mouse pad at
165480	$70 why would anyone care about the
168610	final Mouse furthermore why am i
170800	bothering to do this video well in spite
173920	of a
174140	plain design and subpar build quality it
176660	actually does perform and you know
179120	that's their aim pure performance final
183020	most have put quite a bit of work into
185209	perfecting the sensor controller and
186950	firmware of this mouse while I can't
189140	specifically reveal their secret sauce I
191120	can say that I spoke at length with one
193550	of their engineers that may have put in
195050	a ton of work into massaging the 3310
199520	sensor in this mouse to be the best that
201350	can possibly be for competitive gaming
204290	they told me they put more power into
207020	the sensor designed the circuitry to be
209510	as low latency as possible and show
212209	settings that their team found to be the
214610	most stable and accurate rather than
216739	simply shooting for the biggest most
218870	marketable number which is why they went
221540	with a 500 Hertz polling rate instead of
223820	1000 and why their dpi tops out at 3200
227450	the entire team behind the mouse play
229700	csgo at the legendary Eagle level or
232220	higher and being SMF see myself I feel
236030	like they're making a mess I've been
237860	looking for I've personally tested all
240230	the big hitters this is the first one I
242540	felt actually improved my game it's just
245360	so light and responsive so while I
247970	wanted to hate it based on the horrific
249980	build quality my aim and csgo has never
253280	been so good
254269	I can make click shots in the face with
256310	such speed and precision that I feel
258228	guilty it's enough to make me wonder if
260570	this mouse from this unknown company has
263270	a built-in aimbot despite the amazing
266000	accuracy the build quality was so bad I
268700	had to shelve my first unit fortunately
271820	they have a three-year warranty and are
273890	very responsive the revised summer
276140	edition comes with a whole host of
277789	welcome fixes and tweaks the new Mouse
279890	feet no longer catch on my mouse pad the
282320	back button no longer shakes and they're
284840	looking to make even more changes going
286700	forward as a result of feedback from the
289220	community specifically me that's a lie
292760	kind of AD 74 grams they've crafted an
295789	incredibly light mass the G 100's mm
298610	this has come close if you remove the
301460	weight inside them but they lack some
303680	buttons compare that to the Logitech G
306140	303 at 80
307220	grams the rocket KPM at around 90 grams
310220	or the SteelSeries rival at 128 grams it
314360	feels less like you're moving an object
316700	and more like it's just part of your
318920	hand the liftoff distance is 1 to 1.5
322250	CDs depending on your mousepad color and
324830	while the DPI settings seem limiting
327530	it's all you really need for most games
329570	and more than enough for csgo where
331850	higher ranked players often stick to dpi
334790	zone 400 to 800 Mouse tester and in-game
338180	chess confirm that there is no
339710	acceleration and it just feels
341840	responsive and that's really it so in
344930	summary the light is kind of annoyingly
346580	bright the build quality is suspect at
348710	times and the price seems a bit too high
351250	but the three year warranty is
353900	impressive the tracking performance is
355940	amazing second to nothing else that I've
358490	tried and it's the lightest Mouse in the
360710	category so if you want something that
362330	simply performs the final most might be
364660	your final mouse
367150	that's so cheesy I love it you know what
370160	else you might not need to shop for
371630	again a mobile carrier if you switched
373640	the ting because ting is focused on
375890	customer service and customer
377390	satisfaction first when you call their

384890	human being right from the get-go
387400	I'm not robot I'm a real human being
390800	the average ting user only pays about
393070	$23 per month per device and they want
396110	to prove that switching to ten could
