30	alright guys it's that time again we're
2340	gonna have a look at a brand new series
5250	of custom qck cloth gaming mouse pads
9059	from steel series so as with every
12269	seemingly Blizzard game release steel
14910	series has launched a new series of qck
18630	mouse pads so we have three different
20670	ones I'm only gonna unbox one because
22890	once you've seen one mouse pad and
24720	you've seen the graphic on it you've
26880	kind of seen them all so we've got three
28800	we've got the worgen Edition which is
31080	like a wolf thing that I'm not actually
35309	that familiar with Morgan's but goblins
38309	I have a little bit less trouble with so
39809	we have a goblin one so he's holding
41730	like kind of a green dagger thing he
43980	looks all cunning and goblin like and
47510	then we also have and this is probably
50190	by far gonna be the most popular one the
52949	Deathwing edition so that's Deathwing
56030	I've been playing Warcraft since
58520	Warcraft 2 and even Warcraft 2 had death
61590	wing I believe that was when that
63600	character was introduced and he was he
66900	was pretty wicked back then you had what
69450	Kurgan and sky reaiiy think was the the
73140	Griffin rider hero unit that you had in
76229	the mission where you have to kill death
78150	wing and remember death wing being like
81509	pretty pretty crazy hard to kill so
85020	there you go that's my experience with
87030	definitely so I'm just gonna open it up
89130	and I'll be back in a moment actually
91320	yea I've forgotten my chest tripod there
93900	so I had to have to get that sorted out
96720	alright so the way we open this is the
99000	usual way we open up SteelSeries most
101460	paths which is to break this seal right
103110	here it's an outside and pour the most
108509	pad out the other side actually like the
110850	packaging on the most pads it's kind of
112320	clever you see the mousing surface holds
115979	it all in place pretty well so you can
118140	see it's got some flex to it because
120299	this is a cloth mousepad so it has
123170	included with it a little SteelSeries
125610	professional gaming gear product guide
128429	thing which I'm about to discover I
131220	think ironically does
133620	not include the Wow mouse danke oh wait
139769	there it is all of us the old wall mouse
141750	old wall mouths an old Wrath of the Lich
144060	King mousepad so that's that bad sis
148890	that's a shame that's a shame but you
150150	know what I'm gonna do for you guys
151049	you've also got a sticker I'm going to
153030	show you the new Wow Mouse with the new
155790	updated Cataclysm mouse pads so here is
159480	the Cataclysm Mouse posing on the off
163200	man cords pulling all the wrong way they
166200	don't stay in the right spot there we go
168090	so there is the new Cataclysm Mouse
171109	posing on the new Cataclysm mousepad so
174959	there you have it there's your
175829	SteelSeries logo there there's your
178019	World of Warcraft Cataclysm logo because
180120	Blizzard will not license anything and
182129	see this is a licensed Blizzard product
183810	unless it has a nice big World of
185730	Warcraft logo on it which makes a lot of
187530	sense because they spend a lot of money
189090	developing that brand ok so then there's
191730	uh okay there's definitely himself he's
194760	looking kind of fat you know it's
197190	looking kind of like big in the middle
198450	maybe Deathwing is actually a she and
201410	you know maybe she's expecting I'm
204060	having trouble focusing right now here
205709	though which is a bit of a problem give
208079	me a sec so when I said I was having
209790	trouble focusing I didn't mean like on
211889	my video content I meant I think I had
214019	some dust on the lens and so yes there
216419	it is so there's there's the well mouse
218280	get that from all angles sort of what
220500	it'll look like on the World of Warcraft
222959	mousepad yeah I don't think I'm really
226769	going anywhere else with this okay you
228150	know why here why don't why don't why
229230	don't I at least show you guys what the
231120	wild mouse will look like on the other
233099	World of Warcraft mouse pads so you can
235530	sort of judge for yourself you know what
237449	what goes best with it okay so there's
240030	the Goblin one okay so we've got a green
242010	remember you can adjust the lighting
243840	inside the mouse to whatever color you
246209	want so I would definitely recommend if
248609	you get the worgen one you adjust it to
250410	like a nice blue glow and then if you
253349	get the goblin one adjust it to a to a a
255900	green glow and if you get death weighing
257728	all that it's gotta be a red glow it's
259858	red glow just like just like this
261238	actually just like the box go for that
263400	one and it'll match the definitely one
265050	person perfectly so thanks for checking
267060	out my unboxing above the world of
270120	warcraft
