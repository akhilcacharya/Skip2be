11280	description to learn more about the a
12809	data - drive air AE 400 welcome to my
15630	unboxing and overview of whoa what that
18770	Gandia s-- who's even heard of that
21330	before the answer is probably not you
24359	because they are a brand-new gaming
26760	peripheral company and usually when you
29970	know some random gaming peripheral
31710	company reaches out to me and says hey
33239	we'd like you to check out our products
34829	I kind of look at their website and I'm
36510	just like oh really I don't know what
39329	you bring to the table but in this case
41040	they've actually innovated which is
44219	pretty cool so there are like I said
47160	brand-new company that has brought some
49379	interesting things to the table with the
51629	Hermes mechanical gaming keyboard so
54750	first and foremost it's a mechanical
57180	gaming keyboard which of course you've
59910	seen that before next up it is LED
62910	backlight but if you check out their
64409	packaging they hardly even make mention
67110	of the LED backlighting because the sort
71220	of sad simple truth is nobody cares
73380	anymore because every gaming mechanical
75600	keyboard is LED backlit so this
77490	particular one uses a red LED backlight
79740	okay so that's all fine and interesting
81780	so let's go ahead and get this baby
83490	opened up so this is where they really
87210	got my attention because I ergonomically
91020	there's not much that you can change
92729	about the layout of a keyboard for
95700	gaming without messing it up for typing
98189	which is why companies like Razer have
100439	introduced products like the orb-weaver
102119	which is like a keyboard replacement for
105060	gaming so Gandy is's edition of gaming
107399	optimized keys hasn't managed to bump
109530	the typing experience so we've still got
110939	long shifts long enter' and long
112439	backspace and then we've got a bank of
114630	macro keys over here on the left hand
116549	side it should be noted that while I'm
117990	pointing at particular macro keys the
119969	button the buttons are fully
121619	reprogrammable on this keyboard you just
123479	have to use the included software so
125250	they've added five here and instead of
126479	banks upon banks of them they've
128098	actually added the other keys in places
129750	that make a lot of sense to me so under
132090	the spacebar is somewhere where you
133590	actually conceivably reach and then
135629	under the arrow keys if you use your
137340	right hand on the arrow keys in your
138840	left hand with your mouse you can
140519	actually use that as jump and then
142290	you've got a couple more functions right
143550	here and then they've added a couple
145080	more keys above the right and left arrow
146489	keys which i think is really smart very
148980	very cool
149700	so the included chord is using a braided
153540	design that might feel a little bit thin
156060	and that might give it a bit of a sort
157980	of cheap feel compared to some of the I
159930	think thermal takes branding is
161879	military-grade cable it's like this
163680	thick around but I will I like the fact
165840	that you can actually route it around
167160	things and it's kind of difficult to do
170220	when you have not only the keyboard plug
172980	as well as a USB pass-through but also
175470	to audio pass throughs for your
177870	headphone and microphone as well so
179910	let's go ahead and have a look at where
180989	those go so there's your pass-through
182910	USB port you'll usually plug your mouse
184650	into there as well as your pass your
185970	microphone and headphone ports the
188280	overall build quality the keyboard feels
189959	extremely solid especially considering
192329	these guys are a newcomer so there's
194040	really not much flex to it at all I'm
195840	like wrenching on it in order to make it
197880	flex that much you've got two little
199769	feet down here that ah yes I haven't
201750	seen this in a while I like this so you
203700	can see the entire tops of these are
206160	rubber that means that it is still
208760	non-slip even when they are raised that
212220	you have a higher inclination to the
214799	keyboard love to see that that's one of
216989	my personal little like things that I
219060	like so so anyway you've got a ton of
222139	function key implementation things on
225329	here so for example your media keys are
227880	accessible using function so right there
230579	is your back and forward as well as play
232470	pause mute volume down and volume up you
235650	can also enable game mode which will
237569	disable your Windows key and then
239700	there's a whole bunch of other stuff
240720	over here including brightness up and
242250	brightness down so there are six
243419	different brightness settings to this
245220	keyboard so we're going to go ahead and
246299	plug it in we'll be back in a moment a
247530	few other things to talk about for the
249690	hermès are the integration with your
252389	system as well as with other Gambia's
254609	peripherals so for example when you have
256500	multiple peripherals you can actually
258298	have them interact with each other and
261149	as it detects supported peripherals that
263880	kind of like gears up your little guy
265260	within the software which is kind of
266460	cool
266930	but not as cool I think as the on screen
269419	timers that you can enable now should be
271100	noted that for any kind of serious
272360	eSports competition having an on-screen
274130	timer would not really be approved but
276440	when you're sitting at home playing or
277880	when you're practicing for example you
279320	would certainly be able to use that
280580	functionality and you can also set up
282320	voice alerts which is kind of neat as
284360	well so you could actually bind any key
286340	you wanted to set up anytime where you
288560	want it or any voice alert you wanted
290240	and you could switch between them with
291919	your profiles for example on the fly
293870	which i think is incredibly cool so
295910	they've managed to deviate from an all
297620	black and red color scheme without it
299240	looking gaudy so the gam Deus logo which
301430	is actually Zeus if you look closely at
303440	it which happens to be their gaming
304520	mouse as well we'll be checking that out
305900	soon is yellow but it contrasts nicely
309080	with the rest of the keyboard and the
310639	whole thing actually looks very very
312710	good so the other function functionality
315919	hahaha that you have is you can switch
318199	between 1 to 10 gaming profiles up here
320630	there's actually 512 kilobytes of
322370	onboard memory that allows the keyboard
324139	to save your onboard profiles although
327110	you're going to want to set that up
328070	probably using their Hera software
330169	anyway you can also disable the
332780	functionality of the keyboard like you
334610	would on a laptop for example using this
336440	one and then you've also got yes here on
340400	the fly macro recording that is enabled
342110	using the function and control key so
345020	again that relies on the Hera software
347240	in order to function correctly next up
349550	you've got the cover oh yeah we get a
352669	couple of Gambia stickers included not
355639	that that's a page taken out of razors
357320	playbook or SteelSeries I think they
359840	also include them as well so the wrist
361610	rest I think is a really high point for
363560	this keyboard because if you're anything
365449	like my wife you refuse to use anything
367849	other than a steel series 7g not because
370190	you particularly like Cherry MX black
371960	switches or because you particularly
374030	like the keyboard at all in fact the
375770	layout has sort of a short backspace
377599	which is terrible but you like a nice
379789	big wrist rest the Gandhis has a huge
382430	wrist rest on there Hermes keyboard and
385190	it doubles as a keyboard cover so you
387949	can go ahead and I think it goes like
390620	that
390860	maybe it's like that there we go feels
392510	like something that's for sure there we
393919	go
394220	so you can cover up your keyboard just
396020	like that which i think is very very
397490	cool it's magnetic so getting it in
399919	place is
400639	a problem I just kind of put it close
402379	and then it just snaps into place which
404509	means there's nothing to break no little
406999	like plastic things here or anything
409400	like that I think this is one of the
410930	smarter things that they've implemented
412310	about this particular keyboard you can
414650	switch between six key rollover and n
416900	key rollover using the function key as
418789	well so the advantage of n key rollover
420949	is of course n key rollover you can
422749	press as many keys as you want without
423949	any ghosting or non-registered
426289	keystrokes but it can make compatibility
429710	with your motherboard a little bit more
430729	difficult so you could switch to six key
432379	rollover for the best possible
433669	compatibility and n key rollover for the
435800	best possible functionality which leads
437960	us to the final thing this right here is
443000	a blue cherry MX which I'm just going to
445669	go ahead and turn off the the backlight
448099	here so oh yeah I can show you the six
449960	different backlight levels so it goes
452120	all the way to bright this brightest
453500	then off oh that's pulsating rather
455569	sorry so let's go ahead and turn that
456800	off that's kind of nice alright that is
459560	a cherry MX blue switch with what
461089	they're calling the gam Deus element
462979	around it in effect this is sort of it's
466159	it's like that's a damper down there
468139	that what it does is it makes the key
471050	bottom out a little bit earlier than it
473599	otherwise would so gam Deus is claiming
475430	this improves responsiveness by around
477439	20% and can improve the well basically
482330	yeah improves responsiveness and
483860	shortens the keystroke travel I
486759	personally don't like it I'm just going
489860	to be completely upfront about that I
491779	find that particularly with a cherry MX
493939	blue I'm expecting it to bottom out and
497509	it feels a little bit weird to me
498919	however this is my initial reaction I
500810	can't say for sure that I wouldn't get
502580	used to it over a more extended period
504169	of time it's definitely a much shorter
506419	travel and if you hear the sound because
510379	you're not bottoming out because you're
511969	hitting that damper it has a similar
513740	effect of something like an o-ring mod
515328	but it even feels a little bit different
516828	than that because you're really going up
518510	against something that's under the
519708	entire key rather than something that's
521510	just on the the top of the key or the
523429	bottom of the key cap itself so this is
526010	the one thing that I'd say is kind of
527920	different about this keyboard and I'll
531769	leave it to the individual to decide
534350	whether you want your cherry MX blues
536510	messed with so to speak or whether you
538970	prefer the more sort of vanilla cherry
542420	MX blue experience it definitely makes
545210	the key travel shorter so if that's what
547130	you're looking for is Cherry MX blue
548570	with a shorter travel then this might be
551240	the one for you thank you for checking
552530	out my unboxing an overview of the
554930	Hermes from Gandia stop forget to
556670	subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
557930	unboxings reviews and other computer
559220	videos don't forget to like this video
560780	if you liked it or dislike it if you
562310	disliked it one way or the other is just
564170	fine and leave a comment letting me know
566030	what you think
567140	does Gama Diaz have a chance as a new
569900	gaming peripheral company would you
572330	consider it based on what you've seen so
574370	slick actually pointed out a couple
575720	things to me about this keyboard I know
577340	the video was sort of done but we're
578720	back number one is this is actually kind
581420	of cool I didn't think of this but these
582790	spots right here are aligned perfectly
585320	with the slots behind them meaning that
587540	you should be able to plug them in blind
589100	fairly easily whether you're in the dark
590870	or whether you just don't feel like
592220	looking over your keyboard like this I
594500	personally consider that very very handy
596600	and definitely thumbs up for that next
598280	up is that it looks like we could remove
600620	the gam DS element quite easily if we
603620	preferred a more a more sort of
606620	traditional Cherry MX blue experience
608690	see they come right out so there you go
611750	once that's done we can definitely hear
617870	the contrast between the two keys so
621770	it's much louder and we can also see in
624020	the key travel distance how much less
630110	the Gandy is element 1 is so that's uh
632150	that's very interesting this may
634760	actually be like a pretty-pretty
636680	ultimate grade keyboard especially if
638900	you have the option of removing this
650070	you
