30	this is my keyboard there are many like
2669	it but this one specifically is mine I
5730	love this keyboard I've customized the
7830	key caps I have specific ones that I
9809	like in specific areas it's signed by
12179	people on the back including day9 husky
14969	guys from Team Liquid de nines mom which
18330	is probably the favorite signature that
19650	I've ever gotten on anything
21840	it has custom PB Tiki caps which I love
24539	in ninja printing which is my favorite
26939	it's clique is perfect perfect there's a
31260	little bit of inconsistency between
32759	cherry switches and I love this
35070	generation of cherry switches the clack
37260	is great the plastics and the structure
39660	in the keyboard is awesome this is a DK
42540	9008 g2 it's a little old and it's
46170	technically broken and I really want it
48899	back so let's fix it
59429	intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
62019	their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
64680	6600 K processors check out the link in
67360	the video description to learn more so I
69580	love my keyboard and for many reasons I
72580	think it's just spiffy but to see if
75399	it's worth really fixing and not just
77320	sentimental reasons I'm going to take
78939	around see what people think about
80110	typing on it okay John try typing on the
82990	keyboard don't you think they travel
86830	really easily but they make a lot of the
88420	ways well this is VP Alegre clicking
94240	we're doing but they are too tight I
96310	like it because it's like just like
98799	you're breaking little glass guy only
102909	type with two fingers is it gonna do
107110	something no it's something I am not
109420	sure what you that seems fine okay
114280	so far people aren't quite as enthralled
116049	with it as I have liked it a lot kid a
122440	lot care at all Nick I take my keyboard
125860	do you think
135080	haha okay so people aren't quite as
140460	enthralled with it as I am except for
142710	maybe Colton but I'm gonna try to fix it
144840	anyways now I have a few broken
146790	keyboards having a broken keyboard is
148260	not odd for me this one unfortunately
149970	however had its USB receiver because
152940	it's a USB detachable keyboard fall
155490	inside of the casing now I haven't
158400	actually taken it apart yet so I don't
160170	know if it's as simple as some hot glue
162450	or if I'm gonna have to resolder the
164640	connection on the inside or if I'm gonna
166110	have to take like a USB extension and
168240	chop it and solder the wires in I have
171030	no idea let's go so first things first
175500	I'm just going to try to take apart the
178110	keyboard I've taken three screws out and
180890	that's all I can see in terms of screws
183690	now from there on it's probably prying
186180	the plastic so yeah that looks about
190290	right
190970	you can find everyone smile there I just
193860	hit one these clips so there are clips
197160	and I do need to get those off and then
199740	get a card down in there that can hold
203790	it open I'm going to try to find the
206580	next one here we go
212720	holding on on the sides but I don't see
215250	any clips ah there we go
221870	just one more then does that mean
224129	there's one more on this side yep okay
229140	no the top is off the bottom must have
231510	additional clips as well not completely
238860	bare as you can see but that top bezels
240900	off and that did reveal more screws so
244110	we can keep on working okay I think I
247319	have the OLT as you can see this is in
250200	our two parts so that tray is disgusting
254970	I will clean that out okay here's the
258298	back of the keyboard and here is the
261298	culprit and it actually looks like it
263610	straight-up broke these two plastic
266190	things right here are anchors that are
269070	supposed to be screwed on and holding it
270990	on and they actually broke right off of
273449	the plastic on the inside so I'm not
275010	sure what happened to the keyboard as I
277710	expected hot glue might actually be able
279570	to save it so I'm going to clean this
281220	disgusting thing out and maybe do some
284160	other cleaning around the board and then
286560	we're going to move on now that we're
289740	done cleaning these things a good idea
292080	would be to do some maintenance on your
294389	key caps in terms of cleaning it and
296250	cleaning the board and doing all that
297599	kind of stuff you want to check out
298889	maintenance and lubing techniques click
301530	up here for a previous video that we've
303539	done it's called the ultimate mechanical
305039	keyboard key cap guide and there's a
307260	table of contents thing you can jump to
309090	maintenance or lubing that would be a
310530	good time to check that out but I'm
312720	going to move on and start trying to fix
314760	things so the problem isn't that the hot
317340	glue cracked and broke off the problem
319410	isn't that the solder contacts broke the
321840	problem is that the plastic bits in here
323970	actually snapped right off in the mount
326430	gave away there were two screws going
330539	through it so I'm just going to move
336180	where those are oh so there's big screw
341310	holes here and here not in all four
345270	corners even though there's these two
347360	stands nothing screws into them this is
350370	probably a standard backboard for more
352950	than just this keyboards and I think
354900	we're back to the hot glue method I
357000	could do this with other types of
359520	adhesives but hot glue is easy to take
361860	back off so if this happens to not work
364740	I won't cause any permanent damage
366030	anything it's going to be fine I'm going
368370	to put a little dab right over top of
371700	where it was supposed to be screwed in
373940	I'm also going to put some along this
377790	line here which should in theory help
382650	keep it against the plastic and have it
385950	not fall back in okay so it actually
389250	seems to be in somewhat okay I can try
391830	it oh I'm bleeding um that's probably
396510	fine everything's okay anyways we can
400320	try to pull it up a little bit nothing
402210	really seems to happen and yeah seems
405600	pretty solid so I'm going to try to make
407100	sure that I've lined it up properly I'm
409380	just going to try to plug this cable in
411620	and it seems to be fine
413730	plug the connection in PC we didn't move
416280	at all I think we're good to go
418950	I'm going to plug this into the PCB and
421620	try to type something on it before
423570	putting it all back together properly if
425070	it works we're good to go
426360	I'll close up the case success if not
430130	I'll have to figure something out
434759	what am i screen goblak what the hell
441330	does that make any sense to you
443759	no doesn't oh I think there's some
451870	problems keyboard tester calm oh my
460060	goodness
460630	I think it works there's some weird
465610	things going on okay
471699	the weird things that were going on are
473080	no longer going on there was some crazy
474789	lag when I first typed it in or plugged
477250	it in after the driver was installed so
479740	I'm not sure what that was about but it
481270	does seem to work that's really exciting
483880	this keyboard got me through all of my
486310	post-secondary education and was there
489039	for the almost the entire time that I
491289	have a mineral oil rig and all that kind
492729	of stuff so I'm really happy to have it
496330	back okay let's put back together
502770	this is gonna be so annoying I have to
505870	pry all four eclipses up and then flip
508570	them over because they're stuck on a
510220	Ledge come on okay so after more effort
514690	that I would like to admit and Brandon's
516760	help we finally got the bezel thing on
518950	the trick was there was a guide rail on
521529	the inside so you had to slot it within
524020	the confines of the guide rail time to
526810	put the last final three screws inside
530110	one little Easter Egg that I noticed you
532959	can see just barely the voided warranty
536140	sticker that I pounded right through in
538570	order to hit that screw off
540850	nice little tidbit I like boarding
542800	warranties it's fun
547360	okay so it works due to the hot glue it
551350	kind of turned into more of a like home
554230	arts and crafts project than a hardcore
557410	soldering job that I thought it was
559329	going to
559869	oh well I'm happy my keyboard works
561699	hopefully you guys found that
562989	interesting moral of the story even if
565839	this wasn't all that complicated is if
567999	your stuff breaks and you're far outside
570309	of your warranty like I was with this
572549	just fix it if you can it might not be
575829	that complicated as we saw today not
578470	that bad at all the thing just came
580149	loose and fell backwards take your stuff
582040	apart check it out if you can't fix it
584379	you gained experience from taking it
586119	apart if you try to fix it and you fail
