7280	today we'll be doing a quick unboxing of
9870	the razor armadillo 2 now this is a
13799	mouse cable management system holder
16740	basically it secures the cord of your
19320	mouse so we're going to go ahead and
20670	open up the packaging here 1 2 3 4 razor
25080	as always is a master of packaging so no
30090	matter how expensive or inexpensive the
32399	product is it always comes in a great
34110	retail box so there's like a
36000	multi-layered box Dingaan oh I unpacked
38670	it wrong yeah see so that's not how they
41250	intended not the way it was meant to be
43110	unpacked so here we go so put that back
45989	in there this is how it was meant to be
49230	unpacked you're supposed to take the top
50700	off so the armadillo 2 is a mouse cord
53910	holder okay go ahead and do this it's a
57629	fairly simple straightforward device
61489	basically it's a weighted companion cone
65670	and here I have a mouse here
69299	unfortunately not a Razer mouse this is
71430	just a cheapo Mouse that I got with a
74640	demo unit or something and let's see if
76950	we can figure out how this works ok so
81030	that that moves a little bit that
83659	doesn't come with instructions I guess
87000	they figure you should be smart enough
88560	to figure it out on your own but not
91409	everyone necessarily is so why don't we
94110	go ahead and wrap that around and then
97200	we go ahead and run that to wherever it
99450	goes is that how it works I guess so
103130	hold on hold on because it looks like
105420	there's a bit of oh oh here we go hold
107070	on ok ok I think I get it I think I get
109110	it so I don't get it give me a minute I
114470	get it now it's it's so simple that it
118290	was hard for me to figure out so
120210	basically you push the top like this
122280	that opens up a gap in the side there ok
125100	you take your mouse cord you thread it
127259	into the gap and you let go now your
129780	mouse cord is secured now why would you
131970	need this you might ask
133440	the reason you might need this is
135240	because when you are moving a wired
137580	mouse remember wired mice until you get
140130	into the very high-end Wireless mice
142290	still provide the best performance for
145440	responsiveness for gaming so I mean this
148680	one's probably an exception but a high
150510	quality wired mouse still provides
152430	better performance so the reason is that
154650	there's a lot less drag on the court of
157620	the mouse if it is secured with a
160050	comfortable amount of slack
161910	whereas let's say you've got it running
164250	off the end of your desk which I see
166080	time and time again people with their
167460	mice configured like this so you're
169410	sitting at your desk like this okay so
170550	let's say you look down no no I want you
172500	to stay not you look down I mean with
175050	your camera in your FPS game you look
177240	down so watch this cord now it's hooked
180240	now when I go to look back out all of a
184140	sudden there's extra resistance on the
185790	mouse so I can't move precisely so
188040	that's what the armadillo 2 is for now I
190470	actually use a mouse cord holder at home
192720	I don't remember where I got it but it's
194490	it's a weighted one where the top
196350	unscrews you put the mouse cord into a
198330	gap and then you screw the top back on
199980	to secure the cord very similar idea so
202680	it's just got a bit of heft to it so
204090	that it's not going to move around it
205380	has a grippy bottom so also so that it's
207990	not going to move around and it's so
209700	simple to use that I can't figure it out
