89	thank you daddy Brad for sponsoring our
1500	CES 2018 content check out there's six
3780	skins in the link down below
5100	we're here at high Perkin checking out
6629	three awesome up-and-coming projects the
8880	first one however is project Ultra GB
11370	which is a current name not a final name
13950	but we'll use that for now it's an
15990	all-aluminum Gameboy that includes a ton
18390	of awesome features like type-c charging
20520	an RGB switching wheel to change the
22710	color of the included backlight an
25080	included audio amplifier left and right
28109	audio channel output and potentially LS
30720	DJ software coming from the start we're
32940	not sure on that yet this is all because
34829	it's being made with chip tune fanatics
36570	in mind
37170	my favorite feature however is the og
39239	dot matrix display it looks awesome when
42090	you actually do things on the Gameboy it
43980	looks fantastic I like that they went
45989	that extra step and made sure that it
47670	was that much of an original product it
49800	is gonna come in at hopefully slightly
51960	under $100 but it looks great it sounds
54480	great it feels great I just I'm I'm a
56850	fan next up for the Atari 2600 fans out
59969	there we have the retron 77 this is a
62460	modern console so you have HDMI
64170	1080p ode 16 by 9 aspect ratio or 4 by 3
68040	but then it has the nice things that
69659	you'd expect from an Atari 2600 like
71880	difficulty changing a black and white
73920	switch the option to have savestates
76439	which I guess wasn't in the original but
78119	you have now which is very nice because
79530	could be really frustrating to not have
80939	those in terms of firmware its
82770	officially licensed ella emulation so
85290	you'll load the rom from the cartridge
87390	onto the drive and stella will make sure
89520	that it all works ok and there will be
91590	updates from high Perkin themselves but
93479	you can also load your own firmware onto
96090	the device if you would like as it is
97560	open source and last but not least we
99450	have the mega retron HD which as you may
101759	guess is for Genesis and Mega Drive
103740	systems although it's not emulation this
105930	is just straight-up standard hardware
107700	with 100% compatibility across the board
110220	in terms of modern features you have
111869	720p output over an HDMI connector 16 by
115590	9 and 4 by 3 aspect ratio switches and
118020	an NTSC pal switch to make sure that'll
120329	work for you also there's a controller
122340	in the box just like with the retro and
124229	77 now as you guys know I'm a Nintendo
126270	and Game Boy fanboy so I'm pretty
127890	excited for project ultra GB but if
129899	you're more of a Sega or Atari
131599	let me know in the comments down below
132799	and thank you to D Brandt for sponsoring
135019	this video and all of our CES 2018

142219	other devices as well they have a bunch
143930	of different textured stuff like their
145219	dragon skin or their wood and they even

151370	from scratches or dents which is cool
