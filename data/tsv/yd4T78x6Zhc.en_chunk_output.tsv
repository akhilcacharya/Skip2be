0	there are literally thousands of
2689	imperfect choices for mechanical
5100	keyboards out there and you can
7529	customize them a little add some o-rings
10260	here change some key caps there Luke
12540	actually did a guy welcome to the
14009	ultimate mechanical keyboard guy but
16079	unless you have the know-how to actually
18510	build one yourself you're at the mercy
21449	of those that do or are you what if I
26189	told you it didn't have to be like that
28830	what if I told you that there are more
31679	options out there than you might have
33809	realized what if I told you that today's
37469	video is brought to you by I fix it
39540	I fix it's Pro Tech tool kit gives you
41489	the tools you need to tackle any
42899	electronics repair challenge visit
44730	ifixit.com forward slash line is at the
46710	link below and get yours today do you
48930	want to keep or use any switches that
53370	you like it could be all right so let's
58320	go over what we set out to accomplish
60510	here because when Anthony first came to
63390	me with this idea he had like these
65010	grand visions of programming
67760	microcontrollers and soldering diodes
70380	using 3d printed or laser-cut chassis
73680	and a bunch of other things that are
74909	really cool but this is our first rodeo
78780	so we decided to focus on getting one
80820	working first so with that in mind then
83640	we narrowed our search to parts that can
86189	bolt together relatively easily meaning
90060	though that we can expect to pay a
91470	premium looking at what's available
92909	there's a lot of ten keyless components
95850	out there but then even more options for
98460	the smaller and simpler 60% layout so we
102240	settled on that starting at mechanical
103950	keyboards comm for some essential
106020	supplies Cherry MX brown RGB key
109380	switches three choices of beautiful
113270	anodized aluminum cases to put
115439	everything into and then a selection of
117750	Springs that we can use to actually
120049	customize the feel of our switches so
123149	this way we could make the caps lock key
125549	or the function key more difficult to
128340	press accidentally and then we could
130348	even reduce the actuation force of keys
132720	like lwas
134099	or even the whole alphanumeric set to
136140	improve our speed while maintaining that
138599	satisfying tactile bump of the Cherry MX
141329	brown like the beauty here whoop is that
145200	the sky's the limit for customizability
150180	but while it's really fun to play around
153629	with a bag full of cherry MX is a
156079	chassis and a bag of key switches a
159329	keyboard does not make so we are going
162720	to need to wire them up now some folks
164609	do this manually but a PCB preferably
168900	one that is well documented is much
171120	easier not to mention a lot tinier now
174120	there are lots of options out there but
176370	for our project we turned to banggood
178560	where we found not only this nice wooden
181139	case actually this thing's really nice
183030	and wrist rest but also Satan no
186569	seriously
187200	we found the satan GH 60 a fully
191129	programmable keyboard PCB that seems to
193349	check all the essential boxes
194909	it's got macro support and RGB variant
198030	and it is widely used in the DIY
200220	community as a budget option so with the
203609	power of satan and a plate to go over it
206489	we started to write I said no soldering
211470	for this video so we just really wanted
213959	to make that Satan joke so maybe we'll
215370	do a follow up later with the Dark
216599	Prince G h-60 anyway after some more
218790	digging for a plug-and-play option we
220590	found this on a store called kbd fans
223290	the geek customized GK 64 from semi tech
227669	this PCB is pre-built with hot swap
230459	terminals so not only will we not need
232620	to solder anything ourselves we can much
235440	more easily pull our key switches if you
237840	want to adjust the springs or replace
239790	them altogether and it gets bonus points
241680	for using a detachable USB type-c
244049	connection and having multiple RGB modes
247530	including check this out you guys this
250709	lit AF sound activated mode courtesy of
255180	a little microphone built into the
257250	keyboard before you ask that microphone
264810	can't be used for sound input
266880	and for good reason I mean imagine your
269550	clanmates
270210	if you put your headset microphone right
273390	next to your cheerio next blues right
275420	anyway so while we were talking to way
277830	over at KBT fans we also requested his
280710	stylish Tina chassis a full set of key
284760	caps and stabilizers and another plate
288180	to fit our GK 64 which finally completes
291720	then our component checklist oh and we
296880	also got these which I caught Anthony
300240	working on and he assured me was
303480	productive but I will let you guys be
306660	the judge all this left now is to put it
309750	together and see how well it works
311520	um okay so let's assemble this thing so
315780	we start with what screwing down the PCB
317610	yes that was relatively straightforward
321410	so spacebar where's the hole I can't do
327360	this so that seems to go on that way
329430	mm-hmm what'd they do that on the doodad
332730	cool this is fun all good in hood but it
339990	doesn't even sit like evenly like it's
341790	bowed up in the middle so you're sure it
344400	wouldn't be faster to clip these into
345780	here and then put the whole thing down
346860	hmm
347640	yeah it's probably better to do that
349260	okay wait but there's to know there's
351750	some wiggle room yeah exactly
360910	yeah yeah here let's grab let's grab the
364490	stiffer one for the spacebar yeah like a
367760	much stiffer one okay where's 100-meter
369710	grams cool oh okay cool yeah let's try
373970	it oh wow it's like it's like yeah it
379700	feels like it's pushing you away from
381200	the table okay progress let's do a quick
383900	light up test hey not bad huh all right
389210	so now we can put all the key caps on
393110	all these aren't labeled are they well
402530	backspace isn't working
403730	oh is it working how concerned out of
408080	ten should be beyond that about that
410590	here we go and that is one vent a spin
416540	right there vent right over yeah I would
421640	recommend buying some extras if you're
423230	gonna undertake a project like this so
425930	everything is tested all in all I'd say
428720	that 60% it's gonna take some getting
433190	used to you got a super short shift over
435560	here your delete key is way down here
437920	you don't have function keys obviously
440510	but overall pretty pleased with the with
444770	the end product here it's compact its
447620	programmable it's super portable we
450980	don't have the ability to RGB sync it
453470	with you know Asus IRA or Razer synapse
456950	or anything but we could change out its
460010	case anytime we wanted we can make
461810	adjustments to the force of the
463880	individual keys I mean it's fantastic so
467690	you might be sitting there thinking gee
469070	that sounds great like this does that
471980	mean I should do it too well that really
475940	depends on how much you value your time
478430	and how much you value your money not
482240	only did this involve about an hour's
484670	worth of work not counting all the
486410	researcher finding all the parts and
487910	ordering them our bulk together approach
490910	means that our total
493049	topped 350 US dollars before shipping
497969	ore taxes I mean many people already
500849	bulk at the idea of a hundred dollar
503369	keyboard so this is clearly a deep
506249	rabbit hole for the amateur the more
509339	adventurous among us could salvage from
512519	old keyboards or even build or 3d print
515789	their own cases but there will always be
518549	caveats no matter who you are you won't
521490	get a warranty by going totally custom
525120	so if you care about that so in the end
528870	then while this may not be hands-down
531990	the best mechanical keyboard ever
534269	certainly not for the price nor was it
537750	quite as down and dirty DIY as it could
540839	have been its uniquely ours and for some
543600	people that's gonna be worth it so let
546089	us know would you build your own
547860	keyboard in the comments below and let
550379	us know if you'd like to see more DIY
553379	keyboard stuff in the future maybe next
555449	time I'll even let Anthony at the
