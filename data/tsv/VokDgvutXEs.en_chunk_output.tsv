960	[Music]
6799	welcome to my unboxing of the Philco
9690	magic touch to camouflage 10 keyless so
13620	what does 10 keyless mean it means this
15389	is an 87 key keyboard it is short here
20820	even like a generic keyboard it's like
22830	shorter T shorter so 10 keyless is for
26220	people who want space savings and don't
28380	necessarily need a full number pad well
31500	or a number pad at all alright so what
35550	do we got inside the box first thing we
37739	find is a manual that doesn't appear to
40290	have a word of English on it sweet ah
43579	there it is
44969	yes handling a keyboard when you're
47160	using a keyboard dropping or any kinds
49289	of activities may lead to accidents
51510	please keyboard on a secure flat surface
53460	when in use the keyboard is an
54539	electrical device that contains circuits
56070	and transformers do not expose the
57360	keyboard to water or any other liquid
59149	excellent good advice adopting MX which
62850	is Cherry MX which is our mechanical
64619	switches developed by Zenith electronics
66030	corporation Germany key travel is four
68040	millimeters deeper than comparative
69930	models the actuation point is located at
71760	two millimeters from the top when
72900	pressed down this keyboard uses
74430	individual Cherry MX switches that give
76439	you light touch typing ok so mechanical
80009	keyboards if you guys don't know this
81600	already they are 100 billion times
84990	better and this is all sort of my own
87330	personal opinion then keyboards that are
90119	not mechanical because they are
92540	significantly more comfortable they are
95909	significantly more satisfying to use
98280	because of the awesome noises that they
100590	make and I can guarantee you like I will
104159	put my personal - guarantee of approval
107939	on the concept that they will make you
110790	type faster almost everyone I've ever
113460	encountered know everyone I've ever
115170	encountered it's a guarantee has sat
117149	down in front of a mechanical keyboard
119180	started to use it and realized after a
122040	short period of time that they are
123390	typing faster on it and we're talking
125219	significantly maybe 10 maybe 15 20 %
127590	faster than you can on a membrane
129598	keyboard even if it's a really good
132020	brain switch keyboard so let's keep on
134510	going with this guy right here so this
137150	one uses Terry black switches so the
140150	black switches are actually here there's
142670	a key remover so I'm going to show you
144560	guys what exactly is the dealio with the
148790	names of the various cherry switches the
151160	cherian X that is the brand of switches
153140	that are used and then there okay this
155240	is a very interesting
157250	hold on alpha I'll figure it I was like
158840	so you put it under the thing and then
161360	probably from okay he's laughing at me
164120	now because I think you're supposed to
165110	go this way um so this is a key removal
168860	tool and not not the awesomest one that
170990	I've ever seen there that is what makes
173240	this a cherry MX black the fact that the
175670	actual switch right there is black so
177620	the characteristics of black is that
179330	they had a linear less tactile feel so
181760	you don't feel that that click that sort
185120	of that spring that that's uh you don't
187730	really hear the noise as well other than
190190	the key bottoming out so if you put the
191540	camera close you can actually hear if I
195500	don't bottom them out they're quite
197300	quiet they don't have that they don't
199160	have that loudness that is associated
201110	with mechanical keyboards however it's
203480	still going to be louder to type on then
205130	a membrane keyboard just because most
207410	membrane keyboards aren't built very
208760	well and has a nice solid backplane that
210830	you're going to be landing on if you're
213440	typing with any kind of force whatsoever
215750	so I'm going to pull off a few more key
217220	caps here this is probably the faster
218930	wave to it versus that tool that's the
221630	worst tool I've ever seen for removing
223190	key caps not but I'm like criticizing or
226430	anything but that's sort of not yeah not
228740	ideal and we're going to replace the
230810	WASD keys with the included WASD Keys
236120	let's have a look at the layout layout
237890	is for me the the deal maker or the deal
241310	breaker of any mechanical keyboard and
243110	it can be the difference between a
244400	keyboard that I love to type on but I
246080	absolutely hate and a keyboard that I
248300	hate that type on but I absolutely have
250550	to use because there's no getting away
252380	from it this has my favorite possible
255320	layout no changes long shift key long
260089	shift key long in turkey long backspace
263270	key no long delete key
265580	awesome I absolutely love it in every
268310	possible way you've got a function key
270259	here instead of a Windows key I
272120	personally consider this to be a boon
274250	for gamers because I don't think I put
276740	those on all the way there we go a boon
278930	for gamers because you're a lot less
280669	likely to be bothered if you
282500	accidentally hit a function key because
283849	then you'll have to like accidentally
285800	also hit like f3 to mute your audio like
291050	what a what are the freaking odds yeah
293569	um whereas if you have a Windows key
296120	here that could potentially bother you
297560	however I actually use the Windows key
300530	so having a Hardware switch to turn it
302300	off because I often forget to turn it
304550	back on it's really annoying because
305900	I'll actually press on it I want like
308300	the menu to come up or I want to cycle
312379	through my windows using Windows tab and
314150	I can't so there you go Windows key
317509	function key it does have arrow keys
320389	however you notice the number pad is
323090	missing everything else is pretty normal
325939	the one thing that you'll notice is
327020	missing so still got your scroll lock
328520	and it still got your caps lock buttons
331460	are lights but it doesn't have a number
333469	lock button which makes sense because
334639	there is no number pad ha keys are
338539	labeled on the tops although Philco does
340279	have a ton of options for keyboards
342199	we're actually going to be taking a look
343279	at a fair number of their keyboards they
344690	have lots of different colors of
346000	keyboards lots of different colors of
348440	switches lots of different
350569	configurations in terms of the actual
352250	layouts of the keyboards they are one of
353960	the most varied keyboard manufacturers
357349	out there but the one thing they all
359180	have in common is they all use
361099	high-quality built and they all use high
365449	quality switches so let's just take a
367580	quick look at the rest of the physical
369529	attributes of the of the cammo keyboard
372289	here which actually I was expecting to
374240	look kind of cheeseball but it actually
376219	looks kind of cool okay so you got a
378979	flip up here which will allow you to
381430	tilt the keyboard a little bit can see
383779	again just build quality the weight of
385819	it the proper rubber that's used on it
388550	it's not going to go anywhere no matter
389719	how hard you mash on it we've also got
391909	rubber here here here and here and
394840	you're part number in your serial number
395919	on the bottom in case you need it for
397690	any particular reason so I think that
400630	pretty much comes down to it pretty much
403090	comes down to what your personal taste
404560	is in terms of the look the layout the
406840	switches and what you're more what you
409780	like best
410350	so in general blacks are considered more
412240	of a gaming key switch as opposed to a
414639	typist key switch so depending what you
416560	use your computer for you might want to
418180	go with a different skew however I don't
419380	think most typists are going to be
420699	interested in the camo the camel sort of
423460	look so it's probably appropriate that
425260	they used to gaming switch on this model
426610	thank you for checking out my unboxing
428139	and first look at Philco z-- Magisto
430900	camel ten kilos don't forget to
432970	subscribe to - tech tips and don't
434200	forget it also includes a ps2 adapter in
436660	camo green and these keyboards all
439540	include and key rollover I think well I
443229	think it's like hold on to say yes it
445990	does have full and key rollover means
447880	you can press as many keys as you want
449500	and you won't run into any difficulty
450940	also I've been informed by slick who's
452500	actually more of a keyboard nerd than I
454630	am that this is apparently better than
456400	prying them off with your fingers
457419	because if you do with your fingers you
458590	can apply pressure in the wrong way you
460419	can accidentally damage the switch so
461950	that's why they have this tool which
463360	seems goofy to me but apparently it's
465370	for a reason
465970	there you have it thank you for watching
