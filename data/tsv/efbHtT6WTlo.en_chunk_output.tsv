30	this may be the most expensive keyboard
3030	we've ever tested individually
6450	addressable RGB keys no Cherry MX
11550	switches with custom key caps no
15770	Thunderbolt 3 pass-through with triple
18900	OLED displays no it no it's got none of
22949	those things
23880	it's the completely wooden handcrafted
27330	in Japan keyboard from Tekoa
29880	priced at nearly 1400 US dollars but is
36750	it at all worth it or does it get
39890	chopped by this $40.00 Chinese keyboard
43950	that we bought on Amazon speaking of
47370	things that are worth it by the way
48870	Tunnel Bear tunnel bear thinks the
50789	Internet is better when everyone can
52710	openly access the same content so try

61150	[Music]
68820	available in either maple or walnut from
72040	responsibly managed forests we're gonna
74320	start with a look at the illustrious
76630	Kokua keyboard key meaning both wood and
79869	tree in Japanese see what they did there
82810	simply put it's a work of art the 89
86049	gently concave key caps are cut from a
88539	single panel of wood with their relative
91149	position preserved such that the natural
93490	wood grain pattern is visible on the
95710	finished board the keys contrast subtly
99189	with the chassis which is one solid
101500	piece even on the back where they cared
103569	enough to carve a recessed bevel so that
106149	the board is easy to pick up off the
107860	desk turning now to the poop end of the
110380	stick we've got the $40.00 cooler tron
113380	other than the fact that this board is
115270	indeed made of wood its appearance is
117869	not that similar to the a koa key ok
123100	hand-carved sustainable bamboo sure I
126549	guess but there's no cohesive color
129699	scheme and the keys chassis pieces and
132820	the media keys have no consistency in
135010	the direction of the wood grain then
137200	making matters worse at the top of the
139359	board the wood motif is disrupted by an
141820	obnoxious cooler Tron sticker and a
144549	nearly useless power indicator LED that
147940	I would gladly trade in for caps and/or
151299	num lock lights something her koa
153459	managed to include and in a way that
155650	actually enhances the look of the board
157870	let's go back to the Hikawa and look a
160569	little closer
161380	the laser etched letters on the tree
163630	board have amazingly sharp corners like
166420	they're they're perfect to the eye the
169180	tactile guides are both elegant and
170950	functional and the key caps are aligned
173260	in perfectly straight rows one of the
175660	weakest points of the cheaper boards
178030	looks on top of that poor key
180639	stabilization makes the spacing between
182500	letters uneven assaulting your eyes and
184840	that impression has only made worse upon
186970	closer inspection excusing even the
189639	corrugated look of the bamboo wood grain
191739	the keycaps legend is etched with a
194139	degree of precision that I could
195609	charitably described as serviceable
198190	except for this Internet Explorer
200320	looking key that won't
201740	servicing me at all when it comes to
204350	general build quality from a more
205970	keyboard e standpoint honestly neither
208490	of them is the best we've seen I mean
209990	look at that
211430	flex akoha though at least to their
214370	credit all the key caps are aligned and
216470	sit at the same height by comparison
218960	check out cooler Tron's ragged afro and
221870	low rider style question mark while
225650	we're at it the edges are pretty rough
227780	the f9 key is randomly darker and the
231200	key guides subjectively mind you are a
233270	little too subtle to be really useful
235330	now some have complained that the legend
238610	on this one can be difficult to see
240350	particularly in the dark but cooler Tron
242870	claims that the symbols become easier to
245510	read after 2 weeks of use presumably
248060	thanks to finger crud filling up the
249920	grooves mmm yummy so for build quality
253040	and style points I'm giving it to her
255050	color it even feels and smells way more
258610	woody than the cooler Tron which might
261738	sound inconsequential but it's actually
263780	kind of the whole point here boy alright
267200	then what about the practical aspects of
269990	this showdown the bamboo board believe
272630	it or not is actually surprisingly
273770	decent to type on since it's one of
276230	those men Kanaka boards meaning that the
278600	switches are membrane but a small lip on
281270	the key cap gives the stroke a more
282920	tactile feel it's not as loud as a set
286010	of Cherry MX blues but it is louder than
288260	your typical membrane board it's got a
290660	bit of a weird layout since it's a full
292550	104 keyboard with a numpad but then with
295400	compact navigation keys but I might even
298370	go as far as to say that I like typing
300560	on it at least I would if it weren't for
303020	that astonishingly heavy spacebar but
306800	this stupid thing takes the force of
308810	Thor's hammer to press down it's shorter
311990	than normal and it's its left-of-center
315500	leading some typists to accidentally hit
318080	the Alt key instead alright then but
320860	what about typing on a keyboard that is
323470	35 times the price well to put it
326420	plainly this membrane is mush city
330669	people who aren't accustomed to
333110	mechanical boards might not notice
335560	but those who are and who might be
338470	considering the Jaco Ikki are barking up
341740	the wrong tree so to speak and this
343930	one's got a weird layout too it's like
346200	Japanese but with an English legend
349570	which is great if you're Japanese and
352060	you want to type in English but if
353919	you're used to a North American keyboard
355389	like I am you will be annoyed by the
358450	shortened ENTER and backspace keys you
361030	will have no use at all for the keys
363160	that Japanese speakers use to switch
365110	between their various alphabets and you
367300	probably won't be a fan of the even
369970	stumpy ur spacebar though it should be
373000	noted that this one was actually easier
375190	to use because at least it's centered so
377740	which one's better well truthfully in
381639	spite of the awful spacebar the bamboo
384490	Letran is probably the better type er so
387850	while you can get a real mechanical
390460	keyboard at this price point
391900	the novelty makes it may be a decent buy
395130	especially since unlike the Jaco icky
398139	it's wireless then again we couldn't
401350	even slide the little door shut and
402940	without it breaking as for the keyboard
405460	I believe them when they say that each
408120	individual unit is made by a Japanese
410520	master craftsman in a labor-intensive
413140	process at a rate of just one per day
416760	unfortunately that craftsman didn't
419260	spend any of that time on things that
421090	keyboard enthusiasts actually care about
423280	to be clear no one here hated it I'm
426280	just a little disappointed that someone
428740	could spend so much time making such a
431050	beautiful object then charge a sizable
433570	chunk of cash for it without even doing
435520	the requisite market research to realize
437710	that for 1386 dollars we expect a
442180	braided cable so then which one would I
447130	rather have in my home office honestly
452320	neither of them they're both kind of
455620	novelty items though at least one of
458560	them is priced accordingly I can't
460690	believe that we paid for this thing
463120	I feel like a total SAP often but what's
468070	not awful is ting the mobile carrier
470740	that's focused on customer service and
472660	customer satisfaction first when you
474760	call ting you do not speak to a robot
477100	you get put through directly to a person
479050	and you don't have to pay extra for that
481690	kind of service you pay only for the
484270	airtime that you use with the average
486370	ting bill only 23 bucks a month per
489190	device and if you're stuck in a contract
491050	and switch to ting they'll even cover
493120	25% of your cancellation fee up to 75
496180	bucks they've got new lower mobile data
498880	rates data is now just $10 a gig beyond
501280	the first gig and every single ting
503230	customer will be able to reap the
504760	benefits of this new change so head over
