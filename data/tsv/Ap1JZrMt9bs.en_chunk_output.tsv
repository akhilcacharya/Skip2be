30	synergy 2 is available now and makes
2429	sharing a keyboard a mouse between two
4350	systems so simple that anyone could do
6629	it check it out in the link of the
7770	description down below
8910	we're here at fantex checking out a
10950	setup that has two power supplies shared
13349	into one system that's so simple anyone
15179	can do it or one power supply shared
17730	into two systems so simple that anyone
19740	could do it
20520	fantex has teamed up with c sonic to
22890	make these power supplies and they're
24359	two different ones for the two different
26220	applications let's start with the revolt
27930	Pro this is the one you'll be using if
29670	you want to use multiple power supplies
31320	on the same system that isn't just two
34260	you could theoretically go beyond just
36480	the two we have here but I suspect the
38520	vast majority of people will stick with
40230	just two power supplies now how does
41489	this work you may have seen the power
43500	supply combiner and splitter that fantex
45989	is released in the past they've
47460	essentially built that functionality
48840	into these power supplies individually
51539	so the revolt Pro has your motherboard
53280	connector a whole bunch of CPU and PCIe
55440	connectors a whole bunch of SATA and
57180	molex connectors and then down below
58829	these rubber stoppers there's another
61050	motherboard and another CPU pin input
64110	connector that you would plug another
65820	power supply into it doesn't technically
67500	have to be a fan Tech's power supply
69210	although I do suspect that they would
71010	probably prefer that but you could use
72780	whatever power supply you want and it's
74790	able to share some of its power up to I
76950	believe 600 watts through this main
78930	power supply but it's also able you're
81090	able to use the other cables from the
82740	other power supply if you want to plug
83939	in more molexes or more graphics cards
86130	or whatever else you need
87119	and there's failover protection so if
89700	you are able to power both systems off
91979	of one power supply that is connected
93689	into each other say you go with the
95460	1,000 watt version and you have a beefy
97829	system or the 850 watt version and you
100229	have a fairly mid-tier average system
102750	that people are building these days one
104369	entire power supply could go down and
106170	your system won't shut down another cool
108299	thing about this that I like is if
110100	you're building a system that you need
111750	to power supplies for say Austin and
113970	scrapyard Wars season 3 or if you're
116250	mining or if you're just doing something
118890	crazy with computers and you need
120600	multiple power supplies you don't have
122280	to mess around with bridging the 24 pin
124740	connector with the green wire and the
126329	black wire and making sure that you
127710	switch both the power supplies on at the
129628	exact right time so that you don't have
131250	part of your system powered up and the
133050	other part
133440	not powered up now everything's plugged
135300	into each other it's really simple you
136980	have one power switch everything's just
138630	fine it'll work but moving on from there
140910	we have the revolt X which is kind of
143190	the opposite it splits instead of
145590	joining on this one you have labels for
148350	system one where you have motherboard
150150	CPU connections SATA molex PCIe all that
153930	kind of stuff and then there's system
155670	two where you have motherboard and CPU
156990	as well this is also great but for
159870	completely different scenarios this
161670	enables you to run say two systems in
164070	one box you could have your main system
165960	that you do everything on air and your
167370	day-to-day then you could have your
168720	streaming box or a workstation or a test
171000	system or whatever else on the other
172680	side this also makes it so that say you
174450	have two workstations next to each other
176100	you could run them out of the same box
177870	with two systems out of the same box
179670	split monitors onto each side and then
182010	you're at higher efficiency this is a
183870	1200 watt Platinum rated power supply
187020	and if you look at efficiency curves
188970	down on the lower end if you're not
190710	using that much power say both the
192360	systems are idling on two separate power
194730	supplies you're at low efficiency on
197070	both of the power supplies this will
198959	make it that you're gonna climb the
200100	efficiency curve a little bit make us of
201780	those idling times which is actually a
203400	pretty high percentage of the time
204690	you're using your core you're not using
206130	your computer I guess when you're asleep
207690	and whatnot if you don't turn your
208890	computer off or even when you just walk
210630	away from it if it's idling it will be
212430	more efficient than other possible
214500	solutions you get one power supply that
216540	isn't at a higher price than it would be
218489	if it didn't have this internal
219720	functionality it's a quite competitive
221130	price for other power supplies at the
222480	1200 watt range same with the revolt pro
225060	that we mentioned earlier it's not
226320	necessarily higher price than anything
227880	else in its competitive range and it
229380	looks really good
230160	I like this grill on the top and you're
232260	able to gain this functionality you
233730	could use these things you could use the
235530	revolt X 1200 watt as a single power
237870	supply for a single system you could use
239940	the revolt Pro 850 or 1000 watt as a
242850	single power supply for a single system
245040	you're paying essentially the same
246510	amount and you're gaining functionality
248220	to possibly use in the future say you
249660	want to grow on your system you want to
251760	add a graphics card or two or do some
254160	other crazy stuff and you have the
256320	revolt Pro well you could just get
257970	another power supply link it in you have
260070	more wattage you have more connectors
261630	everything's kind of handled for you
262950	it's nice and smooth so you go with the
264960	revolt X and you
266360	- just add another whole computer you
268639	had a workstation beside you you had an
270080	employee your girlfriend wants a
271639	computer something like that you already
273650	have the power supply you just plug it
275689	into the other system and you're done
277099	you even have to buy another one that's
278659	pretty cool a trusted power supply brand
281030	like see sonic coming together with
282349	fantex to add really cool functionality
284180	to their power supplies and make
285770	everything nice and simple and easy to
287479	use is really cool if you decide to go
289250	with something like the revolt X and
290539	have two systems you might need some
292909	software to link the keyboard and mouse
294919	as well over the system soon I'm doing
297080	sponsor spot there we go synergy 2 is
299479	out they've simplified a whole bunch of
300979	stuff with the new release there's no
302629	longer the server client settings that
304550	you have to set up just all your systems
306020	will work together it's also able to
308000	communicate over more complicated
309979	networks that's energy to you sooner if
311870	you one used to have problems with back
313250	in the past so you have to worry about
314840	that stuff anymore
315650	there's a new UI there's SSL encrypted
318319	connections it's it's much more simple
320930	even able to access your computers
322639	before you've logged into them if you
324500	have all this stuff shared over which is
326569	nice so you can move the stuff over
328009	login from there everything's nice and
330050	good to go if you want to check it out
331849	check it out in the link in the
332719	description I like the video if you
334190	liked it dislike if you disliked it stay
335870	subscribed for all the rest of our CES
337250	2018 content I did not suspect we would
339860	be doing this many power supply videos
341180	but everything's been really cool so far
342830	so yeah stay tuned I'll see you next
344719	time
