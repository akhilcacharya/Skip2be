290	all right so this is the Wow Cataclysm
3270	mouse and I've actually got one of my
5850	co-workers who moved to our Ontario
7859	office helping me with this little
9630	filming session the first thing I
11400	noticed about this guy is it's huge so
13830	there it is next to my incredibly
15630	beat-up and rugged looking g9 so you can
19710	there's there some distinct differences
21480	between the the the crafted sort of
25289	worn-out finish on the Cataclysm Mouse
28289	and the disgusting one help finish on my
31619	old d9 so the first thing I want to show
34140	you guys and the reason I have him here
35520	holding the camera so that I can
36809	actually operate the mouse while while
39540	he points the camera things the first
41399	thing I noticed is it's really really
42899	large so it's actually not I'd say it's
45539	not quite comfortable for me to reach
47280	all of the buttons like I can't really
48690	reach that one I can just barely reach
50850	that one and if you have slightly larger
53789	hands than me that's probably a good
55320	thing and you'll find this Mouse quite
57629	comfortable I think the overall shape is
60000	kind of like the iqari laser and one of
62309	the other things that I did notice is
63960	that not everyone cares about this but I
66869	have a hard time picking up the mouse to
69390	move it if I reach the edge of my mouse
71100	pad without mashing the buttons on the
72659	side so that's something you're gonna
74010	want to watch out for if you do have
75600	larger hands it might not be such a
77250	problem I'm downloading the driver
79350	package right now it's 26 Meg's so I
82020	hope there's some pretty good
82979	functionality in there and I will show
85110	you guys that in a few minutes but this
87600	is just the initial impressions after
89670	putting it on my sx mouse pad which by
93450	the way it glides on like nothing I have
96000	ever seen before
97140	it probably glides better on this mouse
99210	pad than my Akari laser my g9 or any
102030	other Mouse that I have thrown at it
103860	tracking is already dramatically better
106229	than the original wow how switch
107729	honestly I really didn't like it's hard
110340	to quantify but I didn't really like the
111810	feel of the laser when it tracked
113310	whereas this one is quite smooth quite
115439	responsive it they've definitely
116969	upgraded it a lot in that regard okay so
120360	the first thing that the driver
121409	installation did is it updated my
123030	firmware and then it installed itself so
125040	I've got lots of functionality here so
127140	the first thing I want to show you guys
128340	is some of the basic features so over
131038	here the default see
133380	value was at about 800 I turned it up a
136530	little bit and then I turn the
137880	sensitivity down in order to get the
139530	movement just right for me
140760	like I said I love the way this most
142740	tracks though it's very smooth and it
144630	glides great on the SX mousepad all
147780	right so we've got the pointer speed
150050	sensitivity okay so that's all of your
152520	basic controls you don't have quite the
154470	level of granularity that you do with a
156330	more twitch FPS gaming oriented Mouse
159690	from steel series like these I or the
161820	Akari laser but you do have that basic
164730	stuff and it's still better than what
166560	you're gonna get with a generic Mouse by
168330	a long shot now where this mouse really
171090	gets complicated
171990	is all of this stuff so let's start with
173820	the colors I wish I could show you guys
175800	this in the dark but I don't actually
177180	have a way to turn off the lights in my
179040	office so here's one thing I'm gonna do
181470	I'm just gonna turn that down so that we
182940	can actually focus on this there we go
184380	so you can see the color intensity and
185820	pulsation so color changes the well the
188400	color so you can see I have it set to
189990	red right now intensity changes the
192690	brightness and pulsation so I'm gonna
195840	show you guys like a low pulsation
198150	compared to that I had before so you can
200100	see it actually turns off and then comes
203640	on quite slowly so that's kind of
205380	depends what kind of a look you're going
206730	for colors you have pretty much every
209160	option under the Sun so I'm gonna change
211200	it to blue there it is blue I'll show
214710	you guys a couple of the different
215820	colors why don't we do green let's see
218730	what like a like a bright green looks
222090	like there's a green looks pretty cool I
225410	could kind of do this all day this is
227580	the kind of feature that I could like
229430	play with forever on a mouse there's
233130	yellow pretty cool okay so here I'm
236790	gonna turn that back to normal all right
238380	and then there's a whole bunch of stuff
239790	here as well so here are all of the
244080	different things that we can assign to
246120	buttons so first of all you've got all
248340	of your built-in while stuff because
249780	World of Warcraft has some pretty
251970	specific rules for how you are allowed
254790	to bind actions to keys and what is
257100	considered cheating and what is not so
259019	this allows you to just simply bind
261510	World of Warcraft actions to the mouse
263760	buttons without actually binding Lakey
266730	or keys to your mouse buttons that is
268170	built right into wow you can actually
269400	configure this within game as well
271410	should you so desire so you can bind
274350	game commands to a button you can bind
277230	change CPI commands to a button this is
279360	cool check this out
280680	CPI op CPI down so you can assign that
282900	to whatever you want most gaming mice
285950	have actually here d9 is a perfect
288420	example have dedicated buttons for that
290520	and a lot of them don't actually allow
293970	you to change them to different buttons
295740	or bind those to something else if you
297840	don't really care about changing your
299250	sensitivity so that's a pretty neat
300930	feature that they've built right into
302100	the driver
302820	there's also change profile so you can
304860	set a button to change your profile up
307260	profile down or even assign them to
309240	specific profiles so your profiles allow
312120	you to have up to ten different sets of
314750	bound actions to your buttons on the
318240	mouse so if I decided okay well I'm
320160	gonna use like let's say these two for
324630	like profile one and two that way yeah I
327210	sacrifice those two profiles but I allow
330210	myself to bind two entirely different
332430	sets of commands to these ones which are
334500	really more convenient to reach anyway
335910	for my hands and you know two things
338280	here two things here so it really gives
340440	you a lot more flexibility depending on
342210	how the mouse is most comfortably used
344070	for you so that's a pretty cool thing
345720	too and then finally whoops look like
347700	the wrong thing
348270	finally custom macros so you can create
350550	new ones yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah
352950	Wow you're not allowed to use macros and
354630	Wow thank you don't show me that again
355890	so why don't I just create a Mac you
357750	macro that's copy/paste or rather copy
362820	okay so here we go
372750	okay so enter okay okay I don't have I
378210	don't quite have it figured out how the
379560	macro recording works so give me two
380820	seconds here guys alright I figured it
383250	out so there's a couple of different
384390	ways you can create custom macros and
386370	really I don't play well so this is the
389280	functionality that would pretty much
390810	sell this mouse to me okay so I've gone
393030	no delay I've created some custom macros
394950	all you do is type a name just click on
397110	the block's press the keys you want and
398880	then click okay so I've created copy
401580	paste and cut you use the convenient
403770	little chart here to say okay which
405540	buttons go where and then you can just
408030	map them like this so if I click here
409770	and then click copy and I can change it
412080	to whatever I want so I want that to be
414060	a custom macro copy then I can have that
416850	functionality with that button so all
418650	that's really left now is to just show
419910	you guys the functionality that this
421500	enables for the average office worker
423600	yeah you might look weird for having one
425580	of these on your desk in the office but
427200	I mean come on okay I've already got you
428790	know 215 keyboard I have four monitors
430680	at my desk so I couldn't look much
432480	weirder so I'm not going to worry too
433620	much about it so I type something
435680	testing this all right so I've built in
440520	a copy cut and pasted to my mouse should
445080	be no edition so I okay I get copy right
447900	now there we are copy and then you know
451229	enter enter you don't you could build in
452760	like you've got so many buttons here you
454440	could put enter you could put spacebar
456419	you can put anything that you use
457740	frequently just bind it to the mouse so
459780	I'm gonna click this button here and
461450	then I'm going to paste hehe that's so
465570	cool
465960	so yeah here you know what yeah I'm
467850	gonna show you guys real time the the
470460	creation process so I knew okay so we're
474240	gonna make it
474930	enter I don't want any delays okay and
479310	then all I want is enter and then okay
482340	so now I'm gonna find a button that I
484680	want so I think button number four
486150	should be pretty good for enter then I
488040	go over to this interface here I click
490110	custom macros I go to enter apply okay
493979	so I have applied that to the mouse so
495750	now what I can do is I can press enter
498810	enter enter paste enter enter paste
502229	enter enter paste and then if I want to
504630	I can go up here I can
506160	can actually cut instead of copying if
510000	I'm hitting the right one it'll take a
511560	little bit of practice getting used to
513120	where all the buttons are but then I
514890	could press enter enter paste so hold on
519179	let me try that again
519870	cut oh I don't know if the I don't know
521700	if it might have been cut wrong but
523559	anyway pretty cool hey guys so that is
526500	my overall impressions of the
528480	SteelSeries MMO gaming mouse the new
531300	Cataclysm edition basically I think it's
533900	just so much of an improvement over the
536820	old one which I looked at back at launch
538890	in terms of the software as well as the
540540	hardware and I actually really like this
542790	I may just find myself replacing my
544730	trusty well used g9 for this at work
548160	because the the productivity of this
550290	just looks phenomenal oh yeah not to
552360	mention there's memory on board so you
553770	can save your profiles and carry them
555600	around with you pretty sweet don't
557700	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
559170	for more unboxings reviews and other
