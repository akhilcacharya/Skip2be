30	welcome to an on-location unboxing of
3449	the funk surface 10:30 XL we're actually
6060	in the middle of our production set for
9660	our video about the making of the funk
13410	m3s Gaming Mouse
15690	so we we figured since we have a few m3
19140	S's because we have to do some funky
21630	stuff with them we can unbox that later
24600	but this one since we got to open it
26789	there might as well unbox it now so this
28830	is if you guys don't know funk it's
31679	probably because you haven't been on the
33570	gaming scene for long enough because
35180	funk mouse pads have been around for a
38100	super long time I have an ancient funk
40680	pad that's still running on my in-laws
42270	computer still tracks perfectly like the
44789	day I got it it's a soft one anyway this
47219	is the original dual sided Mouse surface
49800	concept yes punks claim to fame was
52500	their old dual sided mouse pads where
55110	they had a smooth side on one side and a
57449	rough side on the other side so if you
59219	like it smooth then you can do that if
60809	you like it rough then you can do that
62190	too large tracking area large rubber
64619	feet this is the XL version so there is
67020	him a large version so this is this is
70380	extra large as you can tell from the box
71970	it's quite large it's about one Linus
74189	body width in height and then about I
78080	don't know two whatever of those is in
82290	length so let's not worry too much about
84299	that let's open this bad boy up all
86130	started in 1999 in sunny California
89040	bunch of passionate gamers and friends
90810	got fed up with computer gear not
92430	cutting it after a successful launch of
94979	the surface 10:30 the archetype was
96780	introduced to the market so there's a
98700	little bit of history of funk and don't
100979	be fooled into thinking performance can
102450	be heightened by adding more features
103470	rather than perfecting core functions so
106380	here is a piece of foam over top of it
108240	that protects the mousepad itself here
110579	is him no ok get a funk insider account
114810	you can be a beta tester and all kinds
116310	of interesting neat stuff like that cool
117810	here's a little pull tab so you can open
120240	it up and get the most out it's nice
121950	little velvety thing that it sits on the
124530	packaging is outstanding this is some of
126540	the best packaging I think I've seen on
128280	a mousepad so the original dual sided
130979	nose pad large rubber feet on the bottom
132660	check that out
133440	oh those are nice those are your like
135480	super like okay it's hard to make my
138450	point of how grippy they are but why
140460	don't I just try putting it on a surface
142470	and then moving a mouse on top of it and
145170	showing that it's not going to move at
147000	all so there I think I've made my point
148980	now and then this must be the the rough
154050	side so it's got a bit of a texture to
156630	it okay and then the smooth side see you
164160	can hear that's a very different noise
165600	so there's two little tabs here so that
168990	you can pop out the mousepad and change
170880	it on a whim so you just pop it out from
173130	there and I think that's pretty much
175830	everything else there is to say about it
177660	it has a two year warranty and thank you
181740	for checking out my unboxing and first
