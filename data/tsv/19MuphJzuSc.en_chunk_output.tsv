0	thanks to synergy for sponsoring this
1620	video from CES 2018 synergy 2 is the
4620	easier way to connect one keyboard and
6870	mouse to multiple computers check it out
8790	at the link below so we're here in the
11670	Nvidia suite where they are showing off
13530	the world's first big big format sorry
18690	excuse me big format display they're
20730	bringing big screen gaming to the PC now
23760	gaming monitors that are big have
25529	already existed for quite some time
27240	and there are even PC monitors that are
29429	as large as 42 inches though it should
32460	be noted that there are only a few
33890	outliers that you could really consider
36090	to be gaming monitors that are 30 inches
39090	or above well that all changes today the
43170	65 inch monstrosity behind me checks off
46620	a ton of the boxes from our video
50370	earlier this year where we designed our
52980	ideal gaming TV so it's got really low
56820	latency like super low like a monitor
59670	it's got DisplayPort and HDMI input just
62489	like a monitor it's got a hundred and
64470	twenty Hertz max refresh rate just like
67140	a monitor and like a high-end gaming
70680	monitor it supports variable refresh
73140	rate with Nvidia g-sync technology so
76350	they're announcing three different
77820	models but all of them are using a VA
79650	panel from a you Optronics with quantum
82320	dot film four DCI p3 color support and
85340	nice deep black levels they're also
87900	using a full array back light solution
90869	with local dimming in order to achieve
93150	1000 nits peak brightness with the
95430	ability to support HDR now they haven't
97920	announced plans for Dolby vision at this
99479	time but it should be noted that most
101610	games maybe there's an exception or two
103829	you guys can leave a comment if you can
105060	think of anything but most games are
107040	supporting HDR through HDR 10 anyway
109560	let's talk results now they haven't
112020	announced how many local dimming zones
114180	these TVs have but if I had to guess I'd
116790	say it's probably similar to the 4k high
119280	refresh rate monitors that they talked
121500	about at CES last year so more than tens
125969	but probably not you know over a
128818	thousand something along those lines and
130889	in terms of results well local dimming
133500	is still not oled so that's a thing you
138210	can see blooms around bright objects in
141210	very dark scenes from time to time and
143400	it was especially noticeable in menus or
145440	if you have a bright moving light moving
148560	around your character like let's say
150240	like a navvy type assistant but if
152880	that's the case you've probably got more
154530	annoying things in your life and in
155880	general and fast paced situations we
158010	didn't really notice it while gaming now
160410	let's take a look at the back of a sirs
162540	prototype here these are absolutely
166430	prototypes so I guess the other thing to
169050	consider is that you've got to give them
170190	some time to improve it so they're
171840	announcing three partners Acer Asus and
174420	HP who are gonna launch displays
176310	hopefully sometime in the summer and
178020	it's up to those guys how they want to
179640	finish the screen matte or glossy how
181680	they want to do the stand the sound the
183630	bezel and the OSD options but in terms
186750	of the actual performance of the panel
188370	they're all using the same panel so it
190470	should be pretty similar okay then so I
194040	mean it's a TV realistically the
195989	expectation would be that you can use it
197670	for more than just gaming so Nvidia
199739	solution to that is to integrate a
202049	shield TV so they're full standalone
205530	device experience into the display and
208530	this is another thing that was in our
210150	video why don't you just have a high end
212459	thing built into the thing why are they
213930	why are they laggy it's ridiculous so
215670	Amazon and Netflix both have 4k HDR
219090	support and now you've got full
220860	integration with Google smart home and
222510	Google Voice which is pretty big and
224430	this is another announcement today that
226410	just like someone mentioned in passing I
228269	was like what really g-sync is now
230730	supported with game stream and in
233220	android games on shield TV though it
237030	should be noted you can't just plug your
238530	existing shield TV into your TV or your
240570	monitor because it only has HDMI out and
243110	gsync on the desktop anyway at this time
245640	is only supported over DisplayPort
247910	another cool thing for the TV guys not
250470	the gaming guys out there is video
251730	playback thanks to variable refresh rate
253650	is done at the native frame rate so if
256380	you're watching cinematic content it'll
258060	be running at 24 fps or if you're
260040	running something like the Grand Tour on
261599	Amazon then you will actually see it at
263940	the 25 fps that it was shot at No
266970	stupid interpolation no pulldown no
269220	nothing like that
270120	so let us know what you guys think in
273120	the comments is couch gaming finally
275280	here we've got low latency wireless mice
277890	we've got wireless keyboards we've got
281010	actual gaming TVs is it time well it's
285090	gonna depend on your budget like I said
286800	it's coming this summer and Nvidia is
288600	not commenting on pricing at all so I'm
291750	just gonna have to wildly speculate
293340	based on what I know about a typical
294750	g-sync up charge over a decent monitor
297060	and say I wouldn't expect these to be
298350	less than probably around 5 grand so let
301200	me know what you guys think you're gonna
302640	see and what you would pay at the
305010	comment section at the comment section
306960	damn it I was so close no let's just
308520	roll with that thanks to synergy for
310590	sponsoring this video synergy 2 makes
312930	the configuration of synergy their
315300	keyboard and mouse sharing software that
317070	works across Windows Linux and Mac
318620	easier than ever even with more
321150	complicated networking setups also
323700	improved with synergy 2 is the ability
325560	to have it running seamlessly in the
327090	background so you can set it and forget
