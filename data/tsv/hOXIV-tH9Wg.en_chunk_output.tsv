350	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
3000	the Razer DeathAdder 2013 edition now
5400	something I noticed about the Death
6779	Adder 2013 is that it doesn't say 2013
10250	anywhere on the box at all in fact the
14099	only hint that this isn't a normal death
16320	adder other than the packaging change
17850	and if you look really closely at the
19740	specs is razors marketing blurb here
22080	where they say how did we improve on
23760	perfection and very carefully we didn't
26070	want to fix anything that wasn't broken
27510	and so we literally didn't change
28769	anything okay
30510	we focused instead on enhancing and
32130	optimizing the Death Adder utilizing
33360	next-generation technologies and further
34620	economics week's ok so did they not
35940	change anything did they change stuff
37170	they did change stuff so let's go ahead
39059	and get this baby opened up they went
40320	from a 3.5 g-sensor to a 4 G sensor so
43140	they've increased the effective dpi and
45390	while the DeathAdder has been and still
47430	is an optical gaming mouse as opposed to
50520	a laser gaming mouse and yes I know
52050	laser is technically an optical
53579	technology but that's not what most
54899	people mean when they say it they have
56789	they've still achieved a 6400 dpi range
61230	for this particular mouse which is very
63359	high for an optical mouse so let's go
65760	ahead and open it up now they did allude
68130	to some economics tweaks and so in
71220	addition to adding an upgraded sensor
73470	they have also made some slight changes
75479	to the shape of the mouse which does
77250	retain its right-handed Gretsch so you
79530	can see here this is not an ambidextrous
81750	ambidextrous mouse alright so we made a
83640	bit of a change to our tabletop here so
86070	that you guys can really clearly see
87780	what razor's changed about the Death
89729	Adder 2013 so it is still a right-handed
92850	shape but you can see it's more subtle
94590	than many right-handed mice so there's
96420	an indentation on this side you can see
98850	the more pronounced curve there and then
102420	when you flip around to the other side
103680	you can see that it is a much less
106200	pronounced curve and actually comes out
107880	a little bit so while a lefty could put
110399	their hand on the mouse the the their
113340	index finger would sit too low and their
115590	middle finger would sit too high and it
116700	wouldn't quite be comfortable it is
117890	shaped for the right-handed player now I
120990	have sort of small ish hands especially
124259	for male but I can palm this thing
126719	perfectly and then I have probably a
128848	little bit of ID looks like about a
131099	centimeter of space left where
133120	even if my fingers were bigger or if I
134860	curved my fingers a little bit I could
136209	have significantly larger hands while
138370	being able to palm the mouse comfortably
140080	now we've encountered gaming mice that
142269	are a palm grip type Mouse but that are
145599	so small that you end up clawing them
148299	unless you have little tiny little kid
150819	hands so that is not the case with the
153010	Death Adder 2013 now an improvement that
155170	they have made that I think is huge is
157360	the addition of these rubber grips on
159280	the side so that is an extremely grippy
161709	rubber I don't know how to make that
162760	point on film without just kind of
165220	saying it guys it's awesome it has a
167500	nice texture to it so that you can you
169989	just by touching it lightly you'll be
171819	able to pick up the mouse with a almost
174010	no effort note by not exerting almost
176349	any pressure on the mouse from the side
177819	at all this is great because it frees
179650	you up to have your mouse hand very
181510	relaxed and your wrist relaxed not
183670	causing any additional tension here but
185799	still being able to lift when you get to
187359	the edge of the mouse pad and there's
188950	another one on the thumb side as well so
190629	you can see that the way that they're
191739	shaped is optimized for the fingers that
194049	are intended to be pointed at them so
196150	this one's a little bit lower a little
197590	bit lower profile for the pinky and this
199750	one's a little bit higher profile with
201639	more of a curve in for the way that your
204730	thumb would be positioned now Razer
206290	calls the buttons on this mouse hyper
208180	response buttons and I don't know if I
210459	would call the mouse wheel click
212019	particularly hyper responsive nor would
214599	I call the front and back clicks
216280	particularly hyper responsive because
218260	they feel like normal buttons to me but
220540	the left is the right click feel like
222310	they're on a hair-trigger so I would say
224049	yes those are definitely hyper
225970	responsive optimized for extremely fast
227980	button presses with almost no effort
229510	whatsoever so what makes it optimized
232569	for programming what's the difference
233829	between a pro level product end and a
236109	consumer grade product a lot of the time
237940	it's well how many times is a pro going
241030	to be pressing the button versus how
242260	many times is the typical consumer going
244329	to be pressing the button so booting up
245470	a computer so that I can show you guys
246760	the lighting effects but I want to show
248680	you the bottom of the mouse as well so
250389	they've got what they're calling their
253949	ultra slick Mouse feet so you can see
256389	there's one up at the top left one up at
258548	the top right and then another one down
260440	at the very bottom so Ray
262430	doesn't give you any particular rating
264110	for how long these are supposed to last
266180	but it should be noted guys that it
267979	actually doesn't matter if it was a huge
269750	surface area along the bottom of the
271580	mouse or a small one the coefficient of
273680	friction would actually be the same
275030	here's the 4G infrared sensor so
277430	precision 6400 dpi many people don't use
280130	DPI's above sort of the lower ranges but
284210	having the flexibility to be able to
286220	turn up your dpi and lower your mouse
288199	sensitivity and turn off acceleration
290090	allows you to really tune the mouse to
291889	use it the way that you want to use it
293300	so here's the here's what the lighting
295340	effects looks like so you've got your
297139	illuminated scroll wheel just like that
299840	okay you've got your illuminated Razer
302990	logo right here which apparently turned
304970	itself off ah there we go so you can
306620	configure it within synapse 2.0 the 2013
309169	edition does work with synapse 2.0 which
311330	takes all of your gaming profiles and
313070	stores them in the cloud so you can use
315680	them wherever you happen to be as long
317419	as you log in it'll store your profiles
319639	on a per game basis so you can map your
321500	you can map your commands however you it
323780	is that you want to do that I want to
325460	just make sure I didn't really miss
326389	anything here okay it does support
327800	thousand Hertz ultra pooling which is
329479	good on many gaming mice do that does
332150	support on-the-fly sensitivity
333440	adjustments and I think that pretty much
336919	covers it for what they had to say for
339289	themselves on the box itself I guess the
341539	last thing is just to show you that it
342949	is using a nice high quality braided
344780	cable so hopefully now that we've
346729	switched to a white tabletop you guys
348560	are going to be able to see that alright
349909	and thank you for checking out my
352280	unboxing and first look at the Razer
354110	DeathAdder 2013 which they didn't change
356479	anything about what they did but they I
359139	don't know whatever so looks to me like
361550	the things they changed are good oh of
363680	note now that I've actually got the
365419	product out of the box because I had to
366919	look at it before it was out of the box
368330	it does say 2013 somewhere so there it
372050	is 2013 is on the mouse itself even
374810	though it wasn't on the outside of the
376729	box don't forget subscribe to - tech
