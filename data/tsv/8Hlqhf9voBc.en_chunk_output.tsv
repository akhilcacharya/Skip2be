0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to
2190	by squarespace built an awesome website
4080	or store with their all-in-one platform
5730	today at the link below so we're here in
8519	the Synoptics booth at CES 2018 so you
11550	might know synaptics for their I don't
13230	know fingerprint sensors touch pads all
17369	that kind of stuff if it's a sensor
19050	they're probably into it but fingerprint
21390	sensors are actually the one we're most
22920	interested in right now so this right
25949	here is the first phone I have ever laid
29189	my hands and/or fingers on with an in
32759	screen fingerprint sensor it's using the
36360	synaptics clear ID FS 9500 and if you
40140	haven't heard of that before well the
42270	reason is that it is not out yet
45239	now this phone is set to launch in early
47760	2018 they won't give us a ton of
50789	information about it but what we do know
52710	is that it uses a six point four inch
55140	OLED panel it's got a dual camera setup
58230	on the back that was actually pretty
60690	snappy but we can't evaluate the image
62910	quality in a setting like this it's got
64709	a pretty clean black and gold overall
66810	design and on the bottom you'll find on
68939	microUSB that was a little disappointing
71159	but thankfully a headphone jack the star
73979	of the show really is the display though
75869	it uses a Samsung OLED panel probably a
78600	good choice there and like any phone
80820	these days that display is kind of like
83880	a cake or an onion it's got layers you
87150	know so what happens here is there's a
89729	glass digitizer that's on top then
92040	there's an OLED panel with its substrate
94110	and then there are actually little holes
96829	that allow light from the panel to
100200	bounce off of your finger and through to
102990	the sensor underneath it reading your
105390	fingerprint now the speed is not as fast
107640	as something like an iPhone 8 but it's
109229	also not as slow as some of the early
111570	generation touch sensors so I didn't
113430	feel like there was really any
114600	compromise that I was making in using it
118079	now the question you guys are probably
120420	all thinking right now why has he not
124110	talked about this yet
125159	is can you see it and the answer is
129538	yes but with a gigantic asterisk because
133230	the only time you can see it and I had
135689	to look pretty closely even under the
137879	powerful lights in here on a black
140040	background the only time you can see it
142260	is kind of at an angle like this by the
144780	time you get to a normal viewing angle
146879	and we're talking like that still it
149190	disappears completely and on a white
152159	background I couldn't I can't oh oh
155609	there it is okay barely you can barely
157739	make it out at all so this is really
159890	freaking impressive and you know what
163890	else is impressive Squarespace you can
166079	create a beautiful website or online
167400	store with one of their award-winning
169109	templates today and the great thing is
171299	no matter what kind of bugs are you know
174060	discovered in CPUs haha your website
177569	will perform well with no downtime no
179940	patching no updates nothing like that
182220	Squarespace takes care of all of it

201239	watching guys you dislike this video
202620	then you clearly hate technology because
205049	like with completely all display phones
209099	being basically the freaking future this
211290	is kind of an important development but
