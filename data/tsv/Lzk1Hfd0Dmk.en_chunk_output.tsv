0	there are two types of Linus tech tips
2250	viewers the ones who can't remember
4620	trackball mice and the ones who are old
7910	like me that's right kids
11460	in the late 90s these bizarre pointing
15660	devices were almost as popular as a
18770	standard ball mouse you know the kind
22769	that had its balls down below but then
26430	fell into obscurity as optical and laser
28949	mice gained dominance but our track
32098	balls bouncing back well Logitech logy
37430	Logitech is giving it a shot
40530	meet the MX ergo their first trackball
44190	in nearly a decade and the video is
47879	brought to you by tunnel bear which
50460	makes it easy to privately and securely

66979	at 260 grams the Ergo is twice as heavy
72960	as your typical Mouse but that's fine
77069	like other trackballs it is not used by
80840	sliding it around the desktop instead
84000	you actually move the pointer by
86670	spinning this optically tracked ball
89189	with your right thumb the ergo is
92340	beautifully designed the soft touch
94950	rubber finish that covers the entire top
97259	of the Mouse gives it a premium look and
99539	as for the feel well it can leave your
103200	hand a little hotter than you might be
104700	used to
105149	but we're inclined to overlook this
107670	because with the base set to its upright
110429	position
111200	reducing pronation or scissoring of the
114119	arm bones it positions the user's hand
116610	similarly to a vertical mouse it is
119869	extremely comfortable I guess that's
122579	probably where the name comes from with
125280	that said was good for the wrist isn't
127679	always good for the thumb moving the
129810	cursor especially a long distance
131730	downward feels kind of like doing thumb
134850	crunches unless you reposition your hand
137720	let's take a look at the buttons the
140220	left and right clicks are rated for 10
142380	million and are otherwise pretty darn
145230	standard these back and forward buttons
148079	are both easily accessible with your
150180	index finger as long as you don't have
152160	child sized hands like I do and the
154380	scroll wheel is rubberized move smoothly
157230	and it comfortably tilts to either side
160680	now we've got a couple of more
162989	interesting buttons this one toggles
166079	precision mode which like a sniper
168690	button on a mouse shifts the sensitivity
171419	for precision pointing and this one is a
174660	logitech easy switch so that you can
177120	switch easily haha I see what you guys
180030	did there between devices with one of
182970	them using the included 2.4 gigahertz
184919	dongle and another one connected via
187169	bluetooth and you might actually find
189720	yourself doing just that track balls are
192810	great for travel because they require
195239	very little area to use ergo and
198840	airplane trade table or armrest will
201239	actually work nicely for much more
203400	comfortable mousing compared to trying
205410	to use a touchpad and thanks to the
208530	Argos four month battery you won't even
211319	need a charging cable with you
213269	fun fact though if it does die it boasts
216360	a full work day's worth of battery after
218459	just one minute of charging okay then -
222780	that's all well and good but what is it
226080	like to actually use it well if you've
230880	never used a trackball before you might
233370	actually be surprised at how easy it is
235319	to convert our writer James went into
237989	this thing with zero experience and
240870	after a few days reported it's become
243720	second nature and some actions like
246599	middle-click scrolling are actually even
249060	easier with a trackball with that said
252390	it's not like there wasn't a slight
254700	learning curve and it has some clear
256769	disadvantages if you use a multi display
259769	setup or an ultra wide monitor for
261988	example you might find yourself having
264120	to crank the sensitivity just to cover
266760	all of that desktop real estate and
269360	while okay that's true of any mouse on
272550	the trackball in particular this really
275760	made accurate pointing on fine things a
278610	feat of concentration since it does tend
281639	to jump a bit when being turned very
284160	small amounts the solution as it turns
287340	out though is to turn on mouse
289020	acceleration which how about that it
292590	turns out that setting does have an
294330	actual use though you will want to
297389	disable it while you're gaming on your
299550	trackball weight gaming on a trackball
303830	yes that's right you can use a trackball
307349	for gaming and it actually doesn't suck
309930	either our resident csgo guru IDI was
313770	actually up and pointing noobs in no
316320	time though he did say that he was a
318630	little disappointed in the ergos
320310	tracking speed which may prove to be
322620	insufficient for players who like to
324030	whip their mouse for quick turnarounds
326690	okay then Linus I'm interested you got
330080	me but why should I buy then the $100
333830	iMac sir go over Logitech's own
335900	competing wireless trackball the m5 70
338930	is the precision button easy switch and
342230	the smoother ball action really worth
345290	the extra $50 maybe not but they are
349640	nice to have and the 20 degree tilt
351980	really is a lot more comfortable and
355000	surely there is no solution that exists
358130	to prop up the m5 70 okay but in all
362180	seriousness though does the MX ergo
364490	belong in your future
365510	well there is still room to improve a
367580	stepless scrolling mode on the wheel a
369920	low latency Lightspeed connection higher
373040	endurance switches and the dedicated dpi
375740	switch would all go a long way towards
378020	making this feel like a true flagship
380480	maybe a g-series trackball is on the
383090	horizon but with that said it's really
386510	good if you're a track baller it's easy
389870	to recommend as for if you're not well
393170	it is the kind of thing you do have to
396800	experience on your own but Logitech has
399890	a 30-day return policy so if you're a
403669	little ball curious then there's nothing
406340	to lose from giving it a spin speaking
411919	of giving something a try
