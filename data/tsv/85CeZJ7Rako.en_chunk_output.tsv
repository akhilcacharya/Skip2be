7429	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
10080	the Elite Jian heli on which I have been
13290	informed is not you know okay okay here
16710	so on their site they actually explained
19199	that leat gen they explained what leet
21779	means which hopefully all of you know
23310	and if you don't then I don't know you
25350	can stop watching now I suppose no no no
27330	I don't reject any viewers I want anyone
29160	who wants to learn about the heli on
30420	Mouse to be watching this video so leet
32549	make means you know you're like elite
34140	and then eg on like Legion like a army
38190	or something so they're like yeah that's
39329	where the name came from it's like leet
40710	and Legion together and I was like oh
42600	well this mouse is called the heli on so
44610	it's probably like hell and like lions
46770	like ah together and that's probably
49200	what it is and then I was informed that
51300	it's an RTS Mouse so what they're
53010	probably talking about is the heli on
55230	unit in Starcraft so there you go I got
58890	told and there's a cool little logo on
61410	the side where you can see the mouse
62910	inside Legion is sort of a new player in
66150	this whole peripheral game but they seem
68310	to be doing some interesting stuff so we
69689	checked out the ldren before which was
71700	which is actually diesels using it about
74549	half and half now with his old mouse so
76409	he's seeing if he can make the switch
77580	it's hard to change mice because there's
79409	so many different things that affect
80880	whether you like a new Mouse or not but
82770	the fact that he's legitimately
84390	considering changing it out is is pretty
86790	strong that's a pretty strong statement
88950	so I was I was pretty impressed they're
91439	serious about building high-end products
93119	which is cool
93810	unlike sort of some of the other guys so
95790	they're using an Avago 9500 laser mouse
98970	sensor made in Japan Omron micro
101340	switches they actually have a cherry MX
103290	blue switch for the attack button it
106530	does have a dedicated attack button
108299	which is in line with the RTS sort of
113220	roots of this particular great packaging
115380	look at this packaging sorry I'm not
116610	actually done with this yet for custom
118530	profile sets six fully programmable
120090	hotkeys customizable sixteen point eight
121979	million color LED and I think pretty
125369	much it eighty Meg's of hard disk space
127680	system requirement a driver does this
129479	thing have okay looks cool
132360	I'll give it that so mouth lot okay so
134670	labels dpi adjustments so 100 dpi is
138210	blue 800 dpi is green 16 Wow seven
141630	different settings for dpi is at least
143280	and you can change the colors depending
144570	which one you're using race switching
146640	can be done with different profiles so
148980	the default is red - Tarryn is blue Zerg
152100	is purple Protoss as yellow custom is
153930	green so that's that's kind of cool as
156030	well so yeah it's definitely definitely
158970	optimized for Diablo and other RTS games
162209	like that wouldn't it be funny if I made
165090	mistakes like that I was just kidding by
166620	the way but wouldn't that be hilarious
168720	if I actually didn't know gaming to the
171270	point where I didn't know what an RTS
173459	was and I was trying to do unboxings for
175140	products that are optimized for them I
176730	mean I didn't know that the hell he owns
178709	a unit and Starcraft I don't think it
180239	was unit in Starcraft 1 so BAM
185270	okay comes with this is something that I
187680	do like to see it actually comes with
189420	replacements for the slippy pads on the
191340	bottom of the mouth so oh 3 M Wow see
194430	it's all about the baller stuff with
196110	these guys on runs which is 3m mousepad
199620	feet and all that kind of stuff
201350	here we go it's an ambidextrous Mouse
203760	and here is the braided cord so it's a
207870	gold-plated cord although it should be
209160	noted that the gold plating here doesn't
211230	do anything the important thing is the
212610	gold plating on the inside you got that
214500	diesel I don't know if he's got that he
217019	says no it's ok
219870	braided cord so it's not gonna sort of
222420	catch on anything and it's not going to
224940	have problems I've actually had one of
226830	my braided cords fall apart not that
228930	long ago but this one seems like it
231060	wouldn't pop out of the side I had one
232709	night where the cord just popped right
234000	out of the braiding so that was sort of
235769	disappointing it wasn't elite gymnast by
238890	the way so on the bottom here we're
242310	selecting different profiles for the
244019	mouse with a dial that's from an
245489	interesting interface so there's that
247170	default Terran Zerg Protoss custom and
251420	yeah it works pretty much like that is
254430	there another way to do this no okay you
256168	flip the mouse over you turn the dial
257430	and then you're in the actual profile
259649	that you want to be in so you don't it's
261298	not tied to a software switch just sort
264240	of unique
265330	ha there it is cherry MX blue attack
267879	button so that's a dedicated a although
270610	I've noticed the fact that you can
272379	probably reprogram that to something
273699	else if you want it has a pretty unique
274780	sound because it isn't MX blue see that
279069	so it actually yeah as like some pretty
281620	serious
282520	click eNOS to it you've also got a
284139	couple more programmable keys so there's
285789	one here one here there's your middle
288159	click left click right click and I'm
292300	trying to figure out if these are
293919	related to something in any way but it
295569	would actually appear not let's go ahead
297430	and plug it in and have a look at what
298629	the lighting zones look like doo-doo-doo
303360	doo-doo-doo-doo watching the video
306909	listening to Linus sing doo-doo-doo okay
310270	well that explains what all this is so
311650	there's just lighting that shows through
312969	here at the bum of the mouse here on the
315250	logo here on the top and here and here
318849	on the side so you can change those
320169	colors to pretty much whatever you see
323680	fit so I want to close by showing you
327069	guys how we actually change the dial on
329050	the bottom and how it affects the color
330430	so you can actually see slightly through
332409	the hole there what goes on but here we
334150	go doop doop doop blue purple yellow
337949	other more different blue oh we should
340750	have had like green instead of another
341949	more different but well that pretty much
343389	wraps it up thank you for checking out
345039	my unboxing of the légion Helion RTS
347949	optimized no see how I almost set RPG
350319	can don't forget to subscribe to Linus
