6500	so today I have the lk1 gaming keyboard
9990	from Raptor gaming they sent this over
11759	for us to do a quick unboxing and
14460	overview on so Oh English isn't the
18029	first language on the packaging itself
19560	it must be intended for looks like the
23580	German market first okay so the brand
26400	new Raptor gaming lk1 offers you
28080	high-end technology performance and
29340	features an unbelievable price so yes
30539	this is a value gaming keyboard
32570	exchangeable red single buttons and a
34530	water-resistant surface are the
35790	highlights of this feature-packed beast
37500	and fast true highlight is the fast
41040	mover technology it locks removed keys
43550	automatically that secures that you
45899	never press the wrong button even under
48480	the biggest pressure of your opponents
49860	okay
50309	compact and slim gaming keyboard water
52590	resistant structure and low noise typing
54239	and precise button pressure point and
55710	egos technology anti ghost is good
57360	because what that means is that
59699	sometimes when you press certain
61199	combinations of keys you can register
63480	like additional ghost keys at the same
67260	time so it's definitely good that that
69570	doesn't happen because that's very
71100	obnoxious so what do we have here looks
74580	like we've got eight keys that go in
76830	place of the red WASD and the red arrow
80250	keys and that is exactly what we have
83159	and we also get a key remover tool these
86100	are really handy to have just sort of in
89070	general because if you ever have to
91170	clean your keyboard it's really nice to
92640	be able to remove the keys in a way that
94439	doesn't risk damaging them so it's
97799	fairly light very lightweight keyboard
104840	and we don't have much in the way of
107250	sort of different features here so let's
110670	just have a look at the overall layout
112040	one thing that I would prefer to see if
116130	they do sort of our second generation of
118170	this particular product is a full-length
120030	shift key as well as an Enter key that
122579	comes over here it looks like what
124320	they've done is they've actually put in
126170	to backspace keys one here and one here
129330	our backs backspace backs
131580	Lackey's one here and one here the
133200	backspace key is positioned and it's
135390	sort of I would consider correct
136890	location that is a full-length one and
139530	but my my sort of reservations about
142230	that are mostly to do with typing and
143940	less to do with gaming um I guess it's
146100	sort of less offensive when you have
148560	additional buttons available here for
150390	gaming for your WASD although this one I
152580	would have definitely preferred to see
153990	as a full-sized enter so the keys are
157140	definitely very quiet like here I'll put
159270	it next to my SteelSeries 7g for
161100	comparison so I'm just going to kind of
162420	mash a key here and mash a key here so
170160	it's definitely quiet terms of overall
173090	layout what do we got so we got our
175380	little flippy things here we've got one
177510	two three four five rubber grippy feet
180180	on the bottom designed in Germany maybe
182550	China I guess that's why it's intended
184170	for the German market and German webbed
186720	which is the first language on there oh
188610	you know what why don't we show you guys
190170	how to replace the keys on your new
193650	gaming keyboard so you just go like that
195450	you find the correct key in the pile and
199800	then you just push it on so these are
203220	really easy just go like that let's find
205890	the s if you can find it which I'm
208650	having trouble with it's always the last
210000	one you turn over right then you just
211709	put that in position and put don't like
214140	that it uses gold plated USB and it does
217590	have a very flexible braided cord which
219900	is kind of nice because stiff cords can
222540	be a bit of a bear to route so you can
225209	see how how flexible it is okay and I
229709	think that pretty much covers everything
231239	there is to say about the Raptor gaming
235200	keyboard that we have here so thank you
