30	thank you master off for sponsoring this
1650	video at CES 2018 check out their
3659	Sennheiser 6xx headphones in the link in
6450	the description down below we are here
8280	at Coolermaster checking out their H 500
10769	m and no stops pulled case and we start
13440	off with four tempered glass panels one
16020	just on the sides you can see all the
17609	beautiful internals of your case one on
19529	the top and the front so you can see the
20970	fans and one on the back so you can see
22619	your cable management now the tempered
24150	glass panel on the front can slide out
26430	I'm not going to do it right now because
27779	prototype case and stuff but it can
29580	slide out and you can put in a mesh
31500	grille so if you're worried about the
33570	airflow it's fine don't worry about it
36030	it comes in the box no big deal but it
38250	does also have mesh on each side and
40410	along the top so that these four big
42750	fans can all breathe properly even if
44520	you do decide to leave that tempered
45809	glass in and right now at the show
48510	they're not filtered but they will be
50460	filtered once you guys are able to get
52020	it into your hands I have been told for
53489	front IO its kind of front slash top IO
56160	the power button is the Coolermaster
58350	logo but with no text in it nice and
60030	subtle and it has an illuminated ring
61920	around it to the right of that you've
63510	got a hard drive activity led to the
65129	left of that you have headphone and
66720	microphone jacks and then above you have
68640	tons of USB which is great to see you
71340	have four USB three type-a ports and one
73979	USB type-c port which is awesome I'm
76350	happy that cases are starting to have
77610	these on the front because you're
78960	starting to see more c2c cables out
80850	there in the wild which is really cool
82350	moving on to the inside of the case the
84509	main notable part that you're gonna see
86130	is the power supply shroud it's been
88200	around for a while now but this one does
89729	have a cutout again been around for a
92250	while now but this one is illuminated
94259	which is cool and there's the subtle
96630	outside halo logo as well I kind of
100229	maybe suggested that they also include a
102630	blank in the case just like how they had
104670	the mesh front they would have some swap
106409	ability for you and we'll we'll see what
109110	happens there just in case you have a
110520	different brand of power supply or you
112140	want to orientate it in a different way
113369	or something else there's also the
115500	ever-popular option to mount your
117299	graphics card vertically so if you don't
119670	have two cards like they have in this
121619	setup which is beautiful by the way but
123750	if you don't have two cards you want to
125189	have one and you want to display the
127049	really cool part of the card which you
128489	rarely actually get to see which is at
130169	the side with the fans on it you
131920	mounted vertically you might have also
133810	noticed that the lighting in the room
135459	has changed quite a bit while I've been
136870	hosting this video that is in sync with
139150	what's on screen it's called screen
140860	follow it has to do with their master
142750	Plus lighting control basically anything
145270	that can connect through Wi-Fi or the
147040	internet in your house or a 4-pin which
149470	like fans in the case and whatnot can
151600	all sync together and follow your screen
154030	or just be set to one color whatever you
156310	kind of want to do we even had something
157870	earlier
158380	where they brought paint up on the
159580	screen and then just made the whole
161290	paint a different color and all the
163810	lights in the room wouldn't follow that
165280	color it was pretty cool it's nice
167440	because with traditional setups they're
169269	all separate the Nano Leafs might be one
171670	one mode your computer might be on
173230	another mode other lighting in the room
174850	might be in another mode it gets kind of
176440	messy and you have all these different
177580	controllers and need to sync everything
179019	up and the not great with this setup
181900	it's all done through your computer you
183819	can nicely set it up on your desktop
185170	it's all handled it's all in one
187120	solution better that way
188350	and last but not least let's jump behind
190209	the motherboard panel we did already
191980	mention that there's tempered glass back
193330	here but a good pair for tempered glass
195819	behind another word panel is good cable
197980	management because if you have messy
199510	cables back there it's kind of a
201250	negative to have a tempered glass panel
202959	so they handle all of that for you which
204820	is really cool they have big panels
206560	covering up all the messy cables so you
208150	don't have to worry about it which is a
209470	huge benefit also of huge benefit thank
212530	you to master out for bringing us the
213700	CES 2018 this year check out there is HD
216549	6xx headphones in the description down
218769	below they're USD $200 and they have the
222489	same sound signature of HD 650s which is
225250	cool I have a pair at home they're
226299	comfortable they sound great they're
228010	open just so you know that's an
229720	important thing for audio files out
231250	there but yeah if you like them check
