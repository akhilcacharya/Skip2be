30	today I'm gonna be having a look at a
1439	product from me onyx this is the Probus
4770	380 high performance gaming mouse pad
7350	like all of their packaging it is
9650	extremely minimalistic you basically got
12150	an image of the product the name of the
14070	product what it is the brand and that is
16949	it so let's flip this guy over and see
20070	what the Probus 380 has to say for
23369	itself so their slogan is lightyears
25230	ahead of the game and in fitting fashion
29160	they named all of their products after
31230	stars so here we go a star has been born
35070	this is taken directly from the Greek
36570	word for forward foot okay so it's in
39120	the history of the particular star that
41370	this one is named for here's a model
42780	overview so it is the physical answer to
45570	performance design and innovation the
48270	new developed surface is treated with a
49829	special silver metallic plastic coating
52710	I haven't heard of that before
53969	according to test results this special
55890	coating offers optimal tracking
57329	conditions and improves the overall
58530	performance of the mouse movements okay
60840	we have implemented a thin vase of PVC
62820	plastic to give stability from the hard
64709	most potent that compromising the
65909	flexibility from a soft mousepad the
67890	back side is made of natural rubber to
69900	insert a shirt a steady grip okay here
72810	we go material PVC plastic base squat
74820	value now we'll talk about that a little
77009	bit more later but squat is the surface
78890	quality analyzer tool that is available
81990	on my onyx mice so it looks like this
85229	score is pretty high okay ultra fine
88350	texture 3d by 260 millimeter thickness
90900	rubber base back and led optical laser
93360	it is compatible with so don't be going
96060	and grabbing an expensive new focus the
98939	8 380 mouse pad for your ball Mouse
101310	please do not I shouldn't need to tell
104159	you guys that it's kind of like using a
107100	VGA output on a GTX 580 just don't just
112079	please don't
112770	okay so packaging we have got a plastic
115860	cover plastic paper covered okay to
119939	avoid any damage to the finish and
121670	speaking of the finish movie that's
123750	shiny look at that I've actually never
126659	seen a mouse pad with a finish anything
130169	like that I'm going to try
131450	get the right angle to show you guys on
133580	the camera what it looks like in person
135560	so that's that's probably about as close
138050	as we're gonna get you can see all of
139580	that shiny reflective spark leanness
143870	coming off of it it's got kind of a kind
146420	of a neat feel to it overall so the
149510	rubber on the back is very very grippy
153019	okay you can see the texture here once I
155630	put that down I guarantee you there's no
158780	way that it's going anywhere now that
161930	it's on the table it'll move my
163519	tablecloth before it'll actually move
165340	itself
166700	here it's just you can read that yet
169459	there you go
170030	lightyears ahead of the game you next
171950	time net here's their little logo down
173930	here in the bottom and really all I'm
175940	gonna be able to tell you guys about
177410	this product is how it tracks and since
180590	I actually don't have a mouse handy or
186079	maybe I do I won't be able to tell you
190760	as much as I hoped
191989	so I've got an ounce 3200 go ahead and
197150	plug that in although it's not really
200359	gonna be any way to tell with any
202280	certainty how effective it is until I've
207109	actually played some games on it
209090	although what I will tell you guys now
210980	is that it glides like mad so you've
215930	actually got a little bit of a texture
217790	to it so it won't start moving without a
220220	little bit of resistance but it is a
222079	tiny tiny bit I mean a tiny bit of
224750	resistance to start the mouse moving and
227060	once you've got it moving it's very very
230150	smooth so most of the drag on the mouse
232489	right now when I'm sliding it across the
234170	mouse pad is actually from the cord so
236359	if I had a way to there we go to reduce
239989	that drag and slide the mouse then you'd
243349	be able to get a better idea it's
245060	actually a fairly worn out nails 3200
247910	you can see the Teflon feet on the
250220	bottom are actually pretty scratched up
252169	from use with another mousepad so big
255769	fan of the ergonomics of this particular
258048	Mouse by the way so that glides like
260120	crazy like I said without playing any
264260	game
264650	it's gonna be very hard to gauge the
267350	overall accuracy of this I'm going to go
270440	ahead and close that so let's see if
273889	there's anything that we can just do to
277370	click around it's very fast very very
281300	fast and from place to place a lot of
284990	the time when you get a new mousepad you
286400	can actually feel it
287570	right off the bat how responsive the
289820	mouse is on it it's a little bit faster
293660	than I'm used to on this pad all right
298190	well thank you for checking out my
299180	unboxing of the Probus 380 i'm actually
302210	going to be doing an unboxing shortly of
304100	the nails 5000 and I'm going to run that
306949	squat tool to find out how it compares
310100	to let's see let's find another mouse
313940	pad that I have around how about the
315770	SteelSeries 5l we'll compare it to that
