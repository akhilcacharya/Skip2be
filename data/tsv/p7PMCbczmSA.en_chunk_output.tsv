30	thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring
1260	our CES 2018 content if you want to make
3990	an awesome website or online store you
5819	can use their all-in-one platform today
7919	we're here at EVGA not checking out a
10110	motherboard or a graphics card or a cool
12389	or anything like that we're checking out
13799	a power supply the EVGA supernova 2200 P
17609	tuned if you can't tell from the name
18900	it's a 2200 watt power supply that's
22830	insane that has 183 point three amps on
25980	the 12 volt rail but despite all of that
28859	in standard room temperature ambience at
31619	full load a full 2200 watts of full load
35910	it will only sit at 50 degrees Celsius
39739	it is rated on the 80 + Platinum 230
43649	volt European scale and yeah European
46620	are wimpy 110 volt North American
49320	standards are not going to apply here
51120	this is way too much power so they had
53190	to move to 220 volts European for this
56879	power supply but that probably won't
59460	affect anybody that'll actually probably
61199	be a benefit for most people because
63239	this is targeted towards probably minors
66180	considering if you look at the
67409	connections on the back there's 9 VGA
70740	cables plugins and each one of those
72990	cables branches off into two PCIe
75240	connectors that's 18 PCIe connectors you
78570	can't even you can't even use that
79860	normally in a normal computer so
81689	definitely definitely for the miners and
83400	I don't know what the peripheral cables
85920	are we haven't figured that out yet
87330	we're gonna free that out probably
88560	tomorrow so I'm gonna throw myself in
90540	the hotel suite later where I'm gonna
92670	break down what kind of crazy rigs you
95009	can actually build with this thing and
96930	what you'd actually use it for in the
99030	real world what kind of mining setups
100799	you might have so I got really busy and
102840	actually had Jake put all this together
104310	so I'm gonna read his notes off here
105899	right now if you threw together a seller
108030	on G 39:30 and asrock H 110 pro BTC +
113399	which is compatible with 13 graphics
115500	cards 13 gtx 1070 t is some Patriots
121320	signature 4 gigabyte edition Ram a
123899	silicon power 60 gigabyte SSD or go with
126719	the flash drive version bunch of risers
129598	a 13 GPU frame
132040	the EVGA supernova 2200 watt power
135010	supply you could pull about 6500 Killah
139030	hash minding directly to equi hash and
141609	jared generate about 65 to $80 a day as
145750	of right now and bitcoin just dipped a
148750	little bit so that might actually go up
150280	later on pretty insane don't have a
152680	price for that whole bench because it's
154150	gonna change drastically wherever you
156159	are and prices right now and all this
157900	kind of stuff is like freaking all over
159879	the place so if you deal shop and try to
162129	play your cards right you can make some
164079	pretty decent Bitcoin whoa thanks Luke
