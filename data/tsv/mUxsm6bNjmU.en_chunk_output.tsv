6620	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
8970	the SteelSeries free which contrary to
11580	what you might believe having heard the
13710	name of the product costs money not very
17130	much money mind you it's not super
19170	expensive but it is it's super freedom
23060	enhancing which is I think what they
25199	were going for with the name but what it
27390	sounds like is that it doesn't cost
28859	anything so there it is tiny little game
32250	controller which has huge huge
36200	functionality especially once we get
38879	into a little bit more about it and you
40620	guys understand what's going on here so
42629	first things first we've got a
43890	QuickStart guide which is thick they
45690	should call it a thick Start Guide yeah
50600	alright how to configure your free on
53340	different devices carrying pouch USB
55710	cable Quick Start Guide Android iOS
59120	including iphones ipads ipods pc mac
64049	general information pairing mode buttons
67760	end of english so what you guys may have
71189	figured out based on that is that
73439	there's a SteelSeries sticker inside as
75360	well as a little guide to their free
77460	product family and the flux product
79470	family which i also have here which is
81240	some pretty sweet baller looking
83100	headphones ah what you may have figured
85290	out is that this is pretty much
86640	universally compatible with any number
89310	of different platforms and it is for
91439	playing games now the first thing that
93720	came to mind for me is holy crap i have
96390	a bluetooth controller that is portable
98939	and wireless and convenient and i can
101970	use it to play like SNES games on an
104729	emulator on my android tablet holy
107000	freakin crap of course that's not what
109920	we're supposed to use it for because
111930	nobody has any SNES games on their
114600	tablet on an emulator because that is
117180	not what you do no playing other games
122780	however if you have other games that'll
125460	work with that - so you got a pre
127320	bog-standard configuration it's perfect
129538	for SNES games although you won't be
131099	playing those with a left and right
132599	shoulder button
133860	a d-pad starting so I mean a and B as
136650	well as Oh No yeah sorry sorry
140430	a BX sorry 1 2 3 4 those are the other
143430	buttons however you got a couple of
145260	analog sticks which actually they're a
148950	little stiff but they'll probably loosen
150930	up in time they feel pretty good not bad
153420	considering again the cost of the
154920	controller and the size so you got a
157440	couple analog sticks in case you want to
159270	use those for you know other games that
161459	you're not playing on an SNES 8 well I
163350	mean you're not playing any games on
164550	this this joke sold um charging you get
167970	about 10 hours of intense gaming with
170010	the device when it's got a full charge
172200	and around 20 plus hours of casual
174630	gaming where you're sort of using it
176420	sometimes and then not using at other
178560	times and I don't know what he's
180000	pointing at I don't know what he's
182040	pointing at poor slick ok belenko oh you
186330	wants to know the cable doesn't matter
188580	the cables just for charging well yeah
192239	you could but then bluetooth anyway so
195930	it's cordless but slick wants ok fine
198450	it's this long it is one Linus arm
201000	length and one Linus chest width
202799	long and the other than that I guess
207000	let's just look sort of closely at it
209010	and how awesome it is and how small it
210570	is oh you know what this might be kind
211860	of funny so this is it next to my hands
214110	so you can see that I will have no
215790	difficulty using this now I'm gonna go
217680	ahead and take the camera from slick and
219150	I'd like him to hold it in his hands so
221150	if you are a large person like slick
224790	who's basically a giant it might not be
227280	perfect for you I hope they come out
229049	with like a free XL or like you know
232230	freed something and it's a little bit
234269	bigger but for now this is perfect for
236390	girls children and men with girly hands
240709	thank you for watching and don't forget
