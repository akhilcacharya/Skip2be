1110	this video at CES 2018 create an awesome
4319	website or online store using their
5819	all-in-one platform today and speaking
7919	of today we're here at Origin PC
9200	checking out their new millenium now
11550	their original millenium launched a few
12990	years back and featured something really
14610	cool it was their variable mounting
16350	system that is now fully patented and is
18480	still here on display normally you would
20490	see the internals of the system on this
22590	side of the computer but they have it
24029	there showing off their variable
25199	mounting here so you have graphics cards
26670	facing up the motherboard is rotated it
29340	looks really cool what comes along with
31380	that is now your IO is all at the top
33239	and they've revamped this part a little
34890	bit so there's now a magnetic top and
38160	show you guys they're six magnets three
40980	on each side and it has velcro mounted
43260	dust cover which is absolutely really
45329	cool just shove that back in there you
47309	see all your i/o like standard is on the
49649	top now the back doesn't have i/o
51300	because naturally it's all up here but
53730	if you want to look at front i/o they've
55590	changed that a little bit too now it has
57030	a sliding cover so you can hide all of
59579	it if you don't have anything plugged up
60899	there and it'll look all nice and sleek
62640	or you can slide it up access your USB
64589	type-c and your LED switch so you can
67409	switch between there now RF controlled
70229	controller so this you don't have to
72210	like target it and point at it from
74010	wherever you just point somewhere
76049	completely different press a button
77220	it'll work it can sync up to I believe
79170	five of these all at once you can change
81000	your whole room if you want to have them
82799	all different colors which is really
83880	cool
84210	or you can just press the button and it
86220	switches to motherboard control and then
87900	your RAM and the motherboard lighting
89310	and all that kind of stuff syncs up you
90810	can have it done either way moving up to
93180	the front there's now an aluminum front
95009	panel that can open from left or right
96630	this one in particular is opening from
98670	the right side and in here you can see
100979	that they have an optional VR panel so
103049	it has an HDMI and two USB three outs
105659	and a hot-swap hard drive Bay down in
108479	the bottom now as far as side panels go
110280	you have a lot of options in this
112079	configuration we have dual glass but you
114570	could have one glass you could have one
116219	aluminum you could have both aluminum
117750	you could have aluminum with a textured
119939	finish on it the one that they have here
121500	is a wood texture so you can actually
122880	feel the grain as you run your hand
124920	along it be glass and aluminum can both
127560	have laser etching so for the glass they
129568	would laser etched the inside so that
131310	your LED lighting on the inside would
132810	catch
133340	just on the inside of the etching and it
134690	looks really cool for the aluminum
136849	panels when it gets laser etched you
138739	could laser etched a photo into there
140000	they have a really cool doom scene done
141769	here but you could get whatever done you
143750	wanted I was told you could send in a
145220	picture of your dog and they could have
146780	it jumping over at some gaming scene
148550	whatever they'll have their internal art
150440	team do that for you super cool also
153049	they're completely tooless so you can
154819	just pull off the magnetic mounting on
156349	the side here it swings out on a nice
158150	hinge and you can just lift it right off
160069	and swap it with another panel if you
162170	want you could order more than two
164030	panels with your system now if you
165680	ordered your new millennium and it's
166970	just you know you're enjoying it a lot
168380	but you just need more out of life you
170900	can upgrade on the fly you don't have to
172459	buy a whole new case you can add this
174200	bottom Bay which upgrades it directly to
176690	the Genesis chassis in there you can
178910	throw pretty much whatever you want you
180260	could have a diorama scene if you want
181790	to do something weird like that or you
183019	could just go directly with a huge
184549	amount of hard drives three and a half
186290	inch or two and a half inch SSDs water
188750	cooling I believe you can have two 360
191420	radiators in the bottom if you wanted to
192829	go really really hardcore with the water
194090	cooling and there you go your upgraded
195799	that's it we're also checking out the
197239	new Omni which now comes to the six
198799	hundred fifty watt power supply which is
200209	great because it can power any single
201980	graphics card it also has moved up from
204049	an MITx board to an an ATX board which
206750	isn't for expanding to multiple GPUs but
209959	you can have more RAM and other
212030	expandability options which is great
213560	it's also on the front has a 144 Hertz
216829	Samsung panel and it's fully upgradable
219739	the CPU the graphics card everything Ram
222590	can all be swapped out by you and last
224930	but not least we have the Kronos XL this
227060	is a step up from the Chronos in terms
229310	of size and power you move up from an
231859	ITX board to an M ATX board also you
235940	have dual graphics cards here they have
238069	displayed the light side and dark side
239870	Titan X graphics cards which looks super
242720	cool in this rig and it can be placed in
245870	multiple configurations so as we have it
247940	here it can be standing up but it can
249560	also rotate down onto its side to show
252019	off those GPUs on the side and to work
253849	quite well in a home theater setup and
