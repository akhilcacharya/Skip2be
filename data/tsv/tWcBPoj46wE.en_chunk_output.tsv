30	so today I'll be doing a quick unboxing
1949	of one of razors newest mice this is the
4920	Razer Imperator and unlike their other
7410	new Mouse this is an ergonomically
9059	design that is if you're right-handed
10700	mouse for gaming okay so let's start
13799	with the important key specs first of
15839	all it is powered by their 3.5 juillet
17880	xur sensor and it is a 5600 dpi mouse so
21960	let's get this open right away it has a
24960	contoured thumb grip excellent okay so
28109	how they are pitching this mouse is in
30179	his control comfort and customized it is
32488	not a mere Mouse and the extension of
34050	your hands it delivers comfort and
35910	better fit for gaming take on foes and
38070	fatigue alike blah blah blah blah
39480	basically I personally never really
41520	liked razors ambidextrous mice for their
43500	ergonomic sigh mean they perform great
45629	and a lot of people do like the
47489	ergonomics but I prefer more of a palm
49230	grip Mouse and that seems to be what
51180	they're going for here with the empiric
52710	or so let's start to get this box open
54180	your knife do you have a knife on me so
56309	I can just cut the seal just like that
58890	so that seems to be what they're going
60449	for is to target that audience that
62460	wants more of a more of a contoured
64860	organ ominous so actually let's have a
66750	quick look and see if I'm missing
67830	anything here so we've got adjustable
70590	side buttons that's oh that's cool
72210	actually
72900	that's one of the things that they've
74280	customized about this mouse I'll show
75600	you more about that in a minute
76710	ultra large non-slip buttons seven-foot
79320	lightweight braided fiber cable and a
81000	gold plated USB connector and on the fly
84390	sensitivity adjustment Teflon feet and
87049	ok alright let's have a look at the
90450	accessory package that razors included I
92340	mean they're great at packaging product
93780	look at that that looks terrific take
96570	off there ok package at the back here
100740	get this opened up and find out what
103079	they've included normally Razer includes
104790	a few key things like a product catalog
106950	user manual alright so let's see how
110310	many of their usual things they haven't
112510	today so you've got your certificate of
114070	authenticity this is a real razor
115630	product also in French very cool all
119080	right you've got a QuickStart guide this
120910	basically shows you how to plug your
122890	mouse into a PC Thank You Razer it also
127330	shows you how to adjust the side buttons
129280	which we will show you in a minute I'm
130630	gonna leave that open in case I need to
132190	cheat while I'm showing you guys how to
133480	do it then we have a master guide and
135790	this is in about 300 different languages
137890	as far as I could oh no it's not even
139540	how many oh no it's about like five
141460	different languages in it including a
142720	Greek alright then we've got a sticker
145410	okay Razer stickers we have a little
148300	card telling you how great this mouse is
149950	thank you for buying it then we have a
152200	product catalog which shows you a bunch
154090	of the other Razer gaming peripherals
155890	that you can buy and then we have I
158470	haven't seen this one before okay one
161290	punch out oh sweet okay to punch out
167680	okay we're following the instructions to
169150	rest your drink so if I had a drink I
172120	would put it here and then three go
174430	forth and kick ass so this is a coaster
177660	Thank You Razer for including this Razer
180430	coaster with my new Razer product
182709	awesome okay so let's get to the mouse
185680	itself so we take off the illness's
187630	sealed just a moment pulling out the old
190630	knife to stab someone in Quad modern
195640	warfare 2 which I don't actually play
197730	I'm just kind of faking it because I
200110	have nothing else to talk about while I
201459	open this package ok here we go so this
205420	is the impurity tour so let's start with
207459	a quick side wall look at it while I
209739	rest my hand on it and kind of show you
211510	how the ergonomics of the mouse work
213730	this is actually very nice feeling and
215620	it's definitely a comfortable palm grip
218410	overall on the most it contacts my hand
220660	at every possible place and this is
223000	really cool so I'm gonna Oh neat ok so
226989	here is how the adjustable side buttons
228880	work that seems to be one of the killer
230320	features of this mouse there's a little
232120	slider on the bottom of the mouse where
234310	you can rock these side back and forth
236620	buttons are actually I use these for
238060	voice communication you can rock them
240519	back and forth so that they fit in the
242380	place that is most comfortable for your
244660	fingers
245510	so I would obviously not keep them here
247220	because I can hardly reach this one I
248540	actually prefer them more towards the
250099	back that's really neat okay so here you
252799	can change your profile so you can save
254780	different profiles on the most for your
256488	dpi as well as your button mappings so
258380	you can cycle between them here that's
260389	really neat as well up here these are
262370	probably going to toggle dpi settings
264110	but I'm just sort of guessing right now
265520	I'm terribly sorry about that up here
267680	are your oversized buttons so they're
270169	actually advertising this as very very
272479	large rubberized buttons actually the
274280	whole mouse has like a rubberized grip
275840	II thing going on that I really like and
277430	then this part is more slippery but
279080	that's okay and then over on the other
281120	side you will find that not a great deal
285820	so here's a quick sort of overview look
288500	at the mouse there it is and then oh
290660	yeah last thing last but not least
292190	you've got your braided cable so we just
294260	did an unboxing of the abysus which I
297410	was not impressed to find just a normal
299600	plastic sheathed cable but this one has
301880	a very nice non tangle braided cable as
304220	well as a gold connector so thank you
306169	for checking out my unboxing and quick
308060	product overview of the Razer Imperator
310639	Mouse
