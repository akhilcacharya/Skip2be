0	this is a brand that maybe not everybody
3330	in North America is going to recognize
5220	and in fact I can tell you right now
8250	that many of their products I'm gonna
10290	have trouble pronouncing because it's
11820	all based on stars and their little
14309	slogan is lightyears ahead of the game
16740	so this is me onyx and I hope I'm saying
18600	that right and then this particular
20220	mouse is a new one it's actually not
22710	even out yet but this is the Neos 3200
26250	so the 5000 is already out but the 3200
29699	is kind of like a slightly lower end
32520	version of the 5000 you can see right
34890	away that the ergonomics are designed
37440	for a palm grip and this is a phenomenal
40020	box like I I'm I'm a nun boxer I see a
42570	lot of boxes yeah this is a great box
44969	it's got like a nice matte black finish
46860	it's very minimalistic it's got like
50550	kind of a cool shape to it and let's
53160	have a look at the overall well the
55590	overall the overview on the back so you
57420	can see it has seven programmable
58890	buttons it has a custom LED light system
61379	so you can actually change the colors of
63090	the LEDs on this Mouse braided cable
65850	which is pretty standard for a high-end
67320	gaming mouse these days it has a 3200
69930	dpi optical LED sensor so that means
73080	that this is not a laser mouse it's got
76350	a truly ergonomic design and it has
78570	friendly rubber coating so all of these
80700	are very very important and I will
82350	actually be using this mouse and I will
83970	let you guys know my impressions either
85830	in a separate video or I'll add a clip
88470	to the end of this one I'm not quite
89610	sure yet it depends how long this is
90990	model overview yeah okay that tells us
93630	pretty much everything we know why don't
94710	we start getting this out of the box and
96210	we can talk a little bit more about it
97619	as we go along so the first part we're
100259	gonna take out is this and we will find
103439	the cable there so it's just a beautiful
105420	braided USB cable you can see that's
108090	going to be quite durable there's not a
109380	whole lot you'd be able to do to have
111570	that snag on anything you can see that
113909	there is a gold plated USB connector and
116579	that once again is uh I would say
119880	typical for a premium gaming mouse but
122250	not all of them have that particular
124049	feature Wow
125670	knowing 20 driver CDs so I'm gonna go
128220	ahead
128530	assume that you either don't need
130030	drivers it could be a driverless mouse
131770	or that you can download the latest ones
133900	from the neonics website which I did
135640	visit and it's very nice all right here
138100	we go
139800	installation okay well maybe this will
141970	tell us how to install it so the mouse
143920	is plug and play all you need to do is
145780	connect the mouse into a free USB port
147610	the LED lights on the mouse will light
149620	up and the mouse is ready to go your
151510	operating system should automatically
153400	recognize the mouse without restarts or
155050	further actions okay so it is completely
157120	driverless you plug it in and you go
159220	that's simple okay warranty is two years
163959	do not try to repair the product ok
166330	customization you can download the
168850	driver software yes you download the
170410	driver software and that's where you can
171880	do all of the customization for the
173260	mouse it is equipped with the unique way
175269	tuning system which allows you to change
176709	the weight of the mouse horizontally on
178900	both sides next to the center for a more
180700	balanced feeling that's kind of cool
182830	okay so let's tap the small buttons
184330	forward so in here Oh hold on tap these
188470	small buttons forward I wonder how you
191470	do that ok I'll be back in a second the
195040	cameraman and I puzzled over this for a
196750	while and the conclusion we came to is
198430	that it must be a typo from the the
202209	næss 5000 manual because there's
205420	there's no way this mouse comes apart
207190	which is good because it does feel quite
209110	solid and I was actually kind of amusing
211750	myself off-camera when I noticed that
214049	the the mouse is designed in Sweden it
217120	says that on the package remember yeah
220630	here it is designed in Sweden made in
222730	China so I was just saying to the
224049	cameraman it comes in one piece it
225549	couldn't possibly be designed in Sweden
227230	but it is so there you have it
230260	alright let's have a look at how long
231700	the braided cord is because that can be
234970	relevant if you keep your computer tower
236709	on the floor and you want to sit at your
239049	death so let's say in theory I was
240970	sitting at my desk like this and I
242859	needed to reach something over
244470	cameraman I might could reach it just
247350	fine as you can see all right so that's
249870	fairly straightforward now I want to
251280	talk about the ergonomics of this mess a
252660	little bit like I said I may actually do
254760	a separate video showing that but okay I
258329	think it should be pretty obvious what
260220	mouse this this reminds us all of right
262710	off the bat but you can see they've
264330	actually made some improvements over the
266670	ever-popular at Carey laser there's a
269550	bit more of a contour for your two
271710	fingers to rest here on the right hand
273630	side of the mouse and they've actually
275280	added some additional buttons so you've
277470	got your one two clicks you've got your
279930	mouse wheel you have your dpi up and
282660	down and then you've got your back and
284910	forward so they've added a dpi up and
288840	well they've added one of the DPI
290430	switches the iqari laser only has one -
293010	to actually toggle between the two dpi
295050	modes so that's one interesting change
297720	it's got large slippy feet on the bottom
300419	of the mouse so no matter what kind of a
301890	mouse surface you're using you should
303750	get good performance out of those and
305580	they shouldn't wear out too fast because
307919	you can see that they're quite thick now
309990	in terms of the sensor performance I'll
311610	have to get back to you guys on that but
313080	thank you for checking out my unboxing
314160	of the Neos 3200 high performance gaming
318120	mouse from me onyx and hopefully you
320490	will see a lot more out of this company
