4799	freshbooks dot-com slash Linus CES so
8970	here I am at CES and once again razer
11219	has an utterly crazy prototype project
16770	lynda thing that they're showing off
18660	that actually really isn't that far out
22170	there so in front of me i have what
24510	appears at first glance to be three
26939	razor blades tilts but one of these
29189	things is not like the other or in sort
33750	of different terms two of them are not
35760	like the other this is a regular razor
37739	blade stealth it has an intel core
39090	something-or-other processor it has a
40890	screen it has a battery it has a GPU of
44219	some sorts of RAM some storage
45899	these ones are totally different so we'd
49230	actually seen concepts like this before
51960	where you take whoa did you just press
55890	that button where you take your phone
58170	and you just put it into kind of a dumb
61320	shell and take that CPU that ran that
64260	storage that battery that Android
66360	experience and make it larger than life
69750	and razor is showing off actually a more
73049	finished version of this than I probably
75659	would have expected so they moved the
78030	keyboard up so there's no power button
80310	here anymore
81060	the power button is now on the side of
83549	the phone so your fingerprint it's going
85439	to work just fine as long as you use the
87479	right fingerprint cuz normally you would
88740	set the razor phone with your thumb
89850	because it's kind of on the side anyway
91530	don't worry too much about those details
92670	then you've got a 1080p screen up here
94829	which may or may not ever be a real
96689	product at all so will it be 1080p I
99270	don't know but in the future they do say
101100	it will be touchscreen so how are you
104520	able to clarify that it will have some
106829	specs but you can't say that it'll have
108270	others because it might not ever be a
110280	part you know what it's not the point
111360	the point is you got a big screen up
112470	here that would be touchscreen you've
114090	got a small screen down here that you
115799	can use as a second screen slash use as
118439	a gigantic trackpad the speakers are
120689	actually built into the phone and then
122430	they're gonna have some other
123210	functionality built into this guy as
124920	well so it's gonna have an extended
126719	battery so you're not gonna have to
128310	worry about the still impressive four
130470	thousand milliamp hour battery but maybe
132000	not good enough to power
133620	this screen for a long time battery
135390	you're gonna be able to get hopefully a
137069	fair bit of use out of it it's got a
138690	full-sized razor grade keyboard so that
141000	means nice clicky keys in the case of
143430	the razor blade stealth as well as full
145019	RGB lighting it's got an illuminated
147120	Razer logo on the back and they're
149040	working out a way to use USB on-the-go
151440	for expanded storage so it's not clear
153870	whether that would be through a microSD
156000	slot or whether that would be through
157560	storage that's actually built into the
159329	chassis itself in terms of i/o right now
162209	the project Linda version of it has a
165000	headphone jack so razer does know we
167760	still need those how about that it's got
169950	a type C input that can also be used for
171780	charging and power and then it's got a
173400	type-a over on the other side so the
175890	idea here is that whether it's for
178200	larger screen gaming or whether it's for
180569	some you know Lightroom I mean phone
182459	processors are getting so powerful that
184140	you can legitimately don't right sorry
186599	this one's tethered down they didn't
187829	want me lifting that one I'm sorry so
190140	you can legitimately do productivity
192599	type work on your phone processor the
194489	idea is now you've just got a bigger
195810	screen in order to be able to have a
197970	better experience so they're not talking
201450	about pricing if I had to guess I'd say
203970	based on just you know the aluminum
206220	construction sort of quality the
208230	components and all that I don't think
209849	it's gonna be cheap so let me know what
211889	you would think would you consider
213930	buying like a shell accessory like this
216690	that is for one specific model of phone
219569	although we don't know what razor's plan
221370	for the future of the razor phone is
222660	maybe they're gonna keep this form
223709	factor for a bit I don't know but would
225750	you consider an accessory like this to
227849	have a more laptop like mobile
230129	experience with your phone device and if
233069	so please leave a comment letting me
235470	know how much you would consider paying
238079	for something like that but wait don't
241260	go away hold on hold on there's one
243030	other thing that I wanted to show you
244019	guys here today Oh check this up so this
247560	is cool I actually asked razer they had
249359	no idea if this was gonna work or not
251280	but hey USBs USB right and this thing
253560	for a project type product not product
258209	project it's in a fairly functional
261329	state actually check this out this right
264120	here is the Razer Mamba
267130	flex it is a wireless mouse that
270460	requires no battery and no wire
273250	whatsoever because it is using inductive
275380	charging now you might say well hold on
278230	a minute linus logitech has had that for
280600	months and you would be right but that's
282700	slightly different because razer
284710	solution doesn't have a battery so when
289360	you take it off the pad you have to plug
291940	in the cable or it just doesn't work at
294430	all and you might go put - that sounds
298180	terrible well hold on maybe it's not
301120	terrible maybe it's just a different use
302980	case because unlike logitech solution
305440	the Mamba hyper flux is extremely light
308530	so what it has in it is a capacitor that
311170	charges up over a span of about 30
313030	seconds because I mean it's got to use
315070	all the rest of the power so for all the
316750	you know chroma RGB lighting and
318580	everything on it and then that gives you
320230	about five to ten seconds of you know
322150	liftoff time we're like oh I
323290	accidentally went off my mouse pad but I
324910	wanted to make sure that it's working
325900	right away and there it is completely
328600	wireless mouse and all yours for the
331960	value price of just - $49.99 us so
336790	anyway thanks for checking out our video
338020	from here in the Razer suite at CES 2018
