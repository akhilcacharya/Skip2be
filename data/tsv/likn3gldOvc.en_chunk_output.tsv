60	today we'll be unboxing the Razer
2220	DeathAdder black addiction addiction
4710	maybe I'm addicted to mice no probably
8639	not
9090	we're gonna be unboxing the Razer
10469	DeathAdder Black Edition which is
13019	probably very difficult for you guys to
14490	read the Box up so I'll read it for you
16379	it features a true ergonomic
18090	right-handed design 3,500 dpi infrared
21150	sensor many people prefer the infrared
23550	sensors to the laser sensors i
25740	personally don't but that's that's
28019	definitely a selling point and 1000
30750	hertz ultra poling which is the maximum
32279	supported by the USB interface there's a
35309	new sensor familiar form factor okay so
37739	the old DeathAdder was released way way
41730	back when and what they've pretty much
43590	done here is they've upgraded the look
45090	upgraded the sensor there is an on black
47129	edition featuring the 3500 there are the
50430	3.5 G infrared sensor but this is not it
52739	okay this is pretty much everything we
54480	said before four times more precision
55980	than a standard 800 dpi mouse cool on
58050	the back we see a bunch of stuff that we
59730	can talk about once we actually open up
61260	the product and finally there's a
62940	message from Razer guy sweet okay so
65790	this is part of their essential tier of
68970	products so what that means is it's a
70950	more of a value product more what you
73799	need to get fragging done rather than
76080	featuring a bunch of frills and gimmicks
78030	and extra accessories personally I like
81720	frozen gimmicks but I also like
83189	inexpensive products so I'm kind of torn
85820	which one I prefer Razer packaging
88350	always excellent so it's all black
90659	inside to go with the Black Edition
93090	theme of this particular product go
96390	ahead so inside here we're gonna
99270	probably find the usual spiel inside so
102840	congratulations there's no turning back
104220	you own Razer now though the cult dot
105990	raises own DOM and all that good stuff
107610	you got a QuickStart guide you got a
109200	master guide you got a product catalog
112020	showing you a bunch of the Razer stuff
113549	that you'll probably also like because
114990	you bought this after all and finally
117960	you've got some Razer stickers which I
120329	used to think we're UV but it turns out
122800	they are not disappointing but not that
126700	big of a deal I suppose in the big
128590	picture so I'm gonna go ahead pick up
130360	this plastic right here where hopefully
132610	I'm not going to reflect it and show the
134440	cameraman who is helping me today so
136600	let's have a look at the actually let's
138460	start here so we've got a gold-plated
139900	connector bold you know here's something
143320	I should talk about Gold is not actually
145270	the best conductor so some people
146590	believe that you use gold on connectors
148420	because it's the best conductor actually
150220	silver is a better conductor than gold
151750	the reason we use gold is because it's
153970	soft and malleable so even when you
156250	insert it and unplug it from your
158590	computer a lot of times it's still going
161170	to make good contact because it's so
163330	soft it'll just reform itself according
166540	to whatever is is brushing up against it
168730	so you have a nice good contact surface
170530	area on there okay you've got a nice
172180	braided cable here so it's not gonna
173860	snag on stuff whenever you're sliding
176170	the mouse across your table I mean it's
177820	not a wireless mouse so you do have to
179530	take that into account the DeathAdder is
182010	most optimal for a palm type grip so a
185590	palm type grip means you're making
187000	contact with the entire mouse as you lay
190060	your hand down on it it means that you
191860	operate the buttons using pretty much
193900	your whole finger not just the fingertip
196360	like you would with a fingertip or a
198040	claw grip okay the Death Adder does not
201280	have any buttons on the side although it
202690	does have like a grippy durable sweat
206200	proof II feeling finish on this side
208180	this is more of a traditional hard
209860	plastic and then over on the other side
211660	we find more grip enos so that means
213370	that your fingers that are on the side
214900	to hold and control the mouse are going
218140	to have an easy time gripping it even if
220239	you have to lift it off of your mousing
221890	surface we have forward and back buttons
223780	on the side although you could set those
225459	to other functionality should you so
227260	desire your standard left and right
228940	click your mouse scroll wheel as well as
230680	a mouse click on the bottom of the mouse
232780	you find your model number product
234760	number rating which is the voltage that
237670	it takes and you find a little bit of
239680	information about your sensor so you got
241120	your 3.5 G infrared sensor precision
243340	3,500 dpi you've also got some slippy
246640	pads which are one two three so they're
249790	little ones but really that doesn't make
251620	that much of a difference in terms of
253360	either friction or in terms of dirt
255610	so I wouldn't worry too much about that
257079	one way or the other and I think that's
260680	pretty much all I have to say about the
262240	Death Adder Black Edition right now
