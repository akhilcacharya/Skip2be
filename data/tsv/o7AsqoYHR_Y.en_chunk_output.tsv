6109	for the ultimate no compromises compact
9269	gaming PC look no further than the
11250	obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
14040	now to learn more alright so the last
16079	time we talked about thermal takes TT
18359	eSports Poseidon we were marveling at
22020	how inexpensive the Poseidon was
23939	compared to competing backlit mechanical
26130	keyboards now they're back with the
28199	Poseidon Z a keyboard that is
30090	functionally pretty much the same thing
31859	that comes in at $10 cheaper so what did
34530	they do to reduce the price even further
36780	making it one of the least expensive
39050	full-size mechanical backlit keyboards
41910	on the market one word Cale no not
46050	cabbage key switches our first Poseidon
49800	this one right here used Cherry MX blue
52469	switches manufactured in Germany well
54660	our Poseidon Z uses blue switches oops
58890	that are manufactured in China by a
60989	company called Cale that happens to use
63449	the same color based naming scheme and
65700	also have a very similar internal design
68460	to their switches because cherries
70080	patent on their switch design has
71700	expired
72270	alright so then what is the difference
74400	well functionally not much the two
77220	keyboards are basically the same thing
78900	it's got a fairly plain-jane design with
81210	no real alterations to a standard 140
83970	layout there's a gaming mode button at
86040	the top right that disables the Windows
87750	key and some media control keys that can
90180	be accessed with a function modifier
91890	that you'll find at the bottom right it
93450	also features a six to eight key n key
97439	rollover which I understand what they're
100229	saying it's six to eight key rollover
102450	depending on which Keys you're pressing
103860	but that isn't n key rollover hopefully
106350	they can get that fixed on their site
107640	soon and hopefully one of these days
108899	I'll get through a review of Thermaltake
110340	product without finding errors or typos
112140	on their box or website but anyway
113759	there's cable management down here so
115110	the cable can come out the right left
116549	they've also got nice high quality
117930	rubber grips on the bottom even on the
120810	foldout elevator piece that allows you
123420	to incline the keyboard the whole bottom
125250	of it is grippy and thumbs up for that
127890	but let's get into what is the
131220	difference why is it cheaper well
133380	because manufacturing in China is
134970	cheaper for all kinds of reasons cheaper
136740	labor and lower costs associated with
138360	transporting the switches to the
139620	factories where the completed keyboards
141660	watch will be assembled just to name a
143040	couple when you trade though in my
145530	experience is looser manufacturing
148080	tolerances I've used a couple of Kail
150450	blue switch keyboards so far and this
152730	one is noticeably heavier than any
155490	Cherry MX blue or even other Kail blue
158220	keyboard that I've used before closer to
160290	Cherry MX greens than to Cherry MX blue
162600	is just from typing on them and that's
164640	the difference I mean look at this you
166170	can probably even hear the difference
167820	Cherry MX blue kale blue well trust me
172950	there you can hear the difference even
174180	if you can't pick it up on the mic one
175830	cherry MX keyboard to another there will
177720	be variants as well but with a newer
180270	less proven manufacturer the potential
183270	for us to discover significant
184830	differences from batch to batch is
186260	definitely still there okay then - is it
190020	okay for Thermaltake to do this doesn't
191820	it feel deceptive and you know what no I
193860	don't think so honestly I'm pretty okay
195840	with the way Thermaltake is doing it
197730	they're not calling the switch is
199410	something that they're not they're just
201060	calling them TT eSports certified
204270	mechanical blue switches all things that
206670	they are and more importantly they're
208800	passing at least some of the savings on
210840	to the customer in the form of a lower
212640	price and a longer five-year warranty
214980	period this contrasts with razor's
217410	approach where they also discontinued
219510	all their cherry MX based keyboards but
221220	then charged exactly the same amount for
223800	the newer models with Chinese switches
225420	something that they may feel justified
227400	in doing since they're now rating their
228720	switches at 60 million keystrokes versus
230580	50 million keystrokes but I would have
232709	liked to see a token discount or a
234510	longer warranty to go along with the
237030	longer waiting on the switches or
238980	something at least so there you have it
241650	this video ended up being more about
243690	kale than about the Poseidon's II but
245730	that really is the main story here
248160	anyway thank you for watching guys like
