30	so today we'll be unboxing the Logitech
2460	G 19 keyboard and since I think this one
5310	might actually take a little while I'm
7020	going to get started right away just
8809	cutting the seals here and I'm gonna try
12389	and see if I can install it on my work
14910	computer so that I can show some of the
17100	cool features of this keyboard so I'm
19890	going to need this let's see in box
22890	number one which just kind of folds up
25500	you'll find the let's undo the zip tie
28859	here so what do we have here we have an
32460	audio okay we have a USB cable and then
37170	we have a oh this is a power cord okay
40290	so it actually doesn't take all of its
42780	power from just the USB cable for this
44969	keyboard you actually need a separate
46980	power dongle so I'm guessing that in
49530	here yes we will find an AC adapter so
55039	the setup for this thing seems pretty
58129	pretty straightforward you take the AC
60660	adapter plug it into the power adapter
63799	there and that was fairly easy so let's
68250	get the keyboard itself out pretty
70920	shortly here we're actually filming this
72570	at my desk so that I can compare against
75540	the g15 g2 or Gen 2 sorry that I use day
80280	today and plug it in to show some of the
83700	cool cool enhancements they have made
85830	over the previous generation g-series
87960	keyboards so I think there's actually
90420	some other stuff in the box here that I
92100	wanted to show before we're quite
93840	finished ah there we go on the bottom of
96570	where the keyboard was you'll find the
98490	wrist rest
99299	I get that a package here so that clips
102000	on just like actually I think this wrist
104610	rest is identical almost identical to
106680	the one I had on my old keyboard so
108689	that's not particularly interesting and
111299	then you'll find the Quick Start Guide
113700	as well as a driver DVD so there we go
118560	so let's get the keyboard itself plugged
121290	in
122330	put it up on the desk here and since I
126110	don't have a powered USB port up at the
131510	front I'm actually going to have to go
133730	around to the back of my desk and plug
135590	this in this is kind of awkward I guess
138410	the cameraman can sort of zoom in on the
140990	keyboard and show you stuff about it
143420	while he's waiting for me to do this and
149230	there we go
151280	powers in and then I need to put the USB
154940	in now there we go okay so is the
161420	keyboard on do we have power I think we
164240	have power
164720	excellent so you can see here we're
167000	installing the device driver software on
169820	the computer and it's already giving me
172520	the options on the keyboard itself -
176860	let's see let's give people a look at
179720	this so here we go generic USB hub
181790	Logitech G 19 LCD human interface device
185720	now there's quite a few cool things that
187280	you can do with the LCD here you can
189530	actually display a lot of the more
191780	traditional stuff and you can use these
193340	little buttons here to navigate so we
195800	can show the LCD clock or we can go back
198709	to the menu okay configure oh wow that's
202670	cool okay here check this out we pressed
204709	configure and it actually gives us a few
207380	different options for the LCD clock so
210080	if I switch in between all these have a
213830	look at the LCD down here it actually
215300	just changes it right in real time like
217850	that I can just click around and show
219410	them so that's uh that's pretty cool and
221660	there's also a whole bunch of other
223130	black and white options as well so let's
225730	go back out of there so okay and then
230120	we'll go into the menu no I'll go into
232790	ah there we go so you can press this
234530	little button right here and you can
236180	switch to program so let's see let's
238040	find something else there's a media
239870	display you can look at pictures you can
241940	watch movies I believe you can actually
243769	watch YouTube videos on here as well
245600	yeah here it is the video player for
247400	YouTube and you can use it as a window
249709	sideshow device now another really cool
251930	thing about this keyboard is you can
253430	actually change the lighting settings
256010	and I'm not sure if we're going to be
257600	able to figure that out in real time
259760	here however it is possible we will be
263840	able to do it I'm not a hundred percent
266479	sure so here's our configuration for the
270050	LCD our global settings let's talk a
273410	little bit about the other random
274520	features of this keyboard as well so it
276229	uses actually the keys feel pretty
278389	similar to the g15 but I've only looked
280310	at it for a second you can see that
282229	compared to the g15 Gen 2 the width is
284900	about the same but you actually get more
287150	macro keys so we've got 12 macro keys on
289580	the G 19 and only 6 macro keys on the
292580	g15 Gen 2 now you've got ah let me see
296389	up here the Gen 2 has your volume
299630	buttons like this as well as your media
301699	buttons up here on the side of the LCD
303520	whereas the new one I actually like the
305960	system a lot better it's got the buttons
308210	over here where you can more
309590	conveniently reach them you know you're
311060	not tinkering around up at the top and
312620	it has like a volume wheel which is kind
315410	of a cool way to be able to adjust the
317120	volume another thing you can do with
318770	this keyboard as I mentioned is you can
320330	change the colors so you can turn your
322250	backlight on and off and you can also
324320	change the colors in terms of different
326150	zones I not really sure how to do that
328580	but anyway I think that pretty much
330289	covers the keyboard overall thank you
332210	for checking out my unboxing video on
333800	the Logitech G 19
