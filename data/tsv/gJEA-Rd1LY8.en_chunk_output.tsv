7919	card and USB reader for your mobile
9480	devices check the link in the video
11160	description to learn more about the
12780	adata - drive air AE 400 now the obvious
15929	thing the obvious misunderstanding is
18240	the Logitech g600 2 is a follow up to
20580	the G 600 it is not in fact brandon was
24300	asking me before we started so for those
26220	of you who don't know Brandon is b-roll
27960	everyone's decided that they want to use
29730	their real names now so there you have
31080	it
31349	so Brandon was asking me well ok what's
33840	it like how does it compare to that
35160	other one we have and I kind of went I
36360	don't know like I don't know what to say
39149	because the G 602 is so different from
43110	any other product like what is it is it
45840	an FPS mouse is it an MMO Mouse is it a
49620	wireless mouse is that a gaming mouse is
51809	that this is it that it's a lot of
53129	different things and I really feel like
55430	particularly with Logitech's pricing of
57750	this mouse they've made a lot of other
60690	products in the market from other
62489	product lines and from their own product
64709	line kind of irrelevant which is both a
67860	compliment as well as something you know
69990	kind of kind of scary because from a
71670	business perspective you want you know a
73619	better average sell price you want you
75750	know better margin you want this you
77310	want that and this is a very value
79229	oriented option that appeal should
81420	appeal to almost anyone so without
84479	further ado this my friends is the G 602
89630	buckle my shoe anyway so it takes their
93180	new science wins approach to design
95189	which means a couple of different things
96479	well most importantly very very rugged
99000	materials so the finish on the top is a
102030	slightly textured hard plastic finish
104520	for the left and right mouse buttons a
106310	rubberized textured finish here for the
109020	palm rest and then a more textured matte
111750	black that goes all the way around the
114060	right side of the mouse all the way to
115829	the back and then around the left side
117930	where your thumb rests so this kind of
120509	reminds me of their older like they're
122909	really old performance mxr like like
125969	they're really shapely wireless mice a
127680	little bit in terms of the shape a much
129179	more sleek more streamlined lower more
131459	optimized for gaming
133330	okay so that the whole idea behind
134860	science wins is these materials aren't
136510	going to wear out the next idea behind
138160	science winds is other things aren't
139720	going to wear out so these buttons here
141130	are rated for twenty million clicks each
143680	which is outstanding but feet on the
146320	bottom are rated for 250 kilometers of
149470	travel and you can tell there's quite a
151120	large surface area to them both around
153010	the outsides of the mouse as well as
154750	around the optical sensor yes my friends
157480	this is an optical mouse it is a sort of
160750	closer to $100 than it is to $50 optical
164020	mouse that only runs at 2500 dpi and you
167020	might kind of go oh well I could get a
168250	higher dpi Mouse for that money yes you
170140	could but would you need it this is a
172390	return to practicality is the DPI race
174730	over Logitech g600 2 says may be which
178390	is fascinating to me because 2500 dpi is
180670	more than I've ever used in my life and
182440	some people do particularly like very
184690	high sensitivity but many don't
186490	and some people are noticing issues
189040	particularly with laser mice which the
191230	very high DPI Mouse tend to be and
193750	acceleration issues and we shouldn't see
196240	any of that although I haven't tried the
197590	mouse yet but I'm stoked to turn it on
200110	so also here on the bottom we're going
201910	to find a power switch so you can turn
203530	it off or you can turn it on but I can't
205330	imagine why you'd want to turn it off
206650	more on that in a moment
207910	as well as check that out double-a
211030	batteries gone are the proprietary
214239	battery packs and what's even more
215620	impressive about this is the battery
217060	life of this mouse logitech is quoting
220230	250 hours if you have both batteries
223959	installed of continuous gaming in gaming
228580	performance mode so like if you could
230709	actually game for 250 hours straight
232780	then you could probably drain both
235060	batteries you don't have to use both
236739	batteries if you want to adjust the
238450	weight and the weight distribution you
240700	can install just one battery either in
242470	the right or in the left and you'll get
244450	about 125 hours it actually says 240
247239	hours on the Box 250 on their website so
249549	let's just assume somewhere in that
250720	range and then half of somewhere in that
253030	range
253450	you can also switch it to endurance mode
255519	using the switch right here and then you
257470	will actually get seen green and blue so
259988	in like green endurance mode you can get
261789	up to 1400 hours of battery life on a
264669	single charge so
266820	this is a prime candidate for just
268620	having a couple rechargeable batteries
270180	nearby and basically not even worrying
272730	about the wireless aspect now they've
274080	they're claiming that it is gaming grade
276600	Wireless so no perceivable latency
278970	however it should be noted that this
280650	mouse only does 500 Hertz so 500 reports
284700	per second we've seen gaming mice that
286290	are capable of a thousand but that
288270	really raises the question can people
289920	feel the difference between 500 Hertz
291720	and a thousand and how would that affect
294540	battery life and all those other things
295830	so is this the reasonable trade-off in
297720	much the same way that 2500 dpi is I'll
299910	let you guys be the judge of that
301140	because while I haven't used fire higher
304140	than 2500 dpi on a regular basis I do
306690	tend to crank my mice up to as high a
309500	refresh rate as I can so now let's go
312750	ahead and have a look at the actual
314220	mouse because we've talked a lot about
315750	the technology not a lot about what's on
317280	here so it has 11 programmable buttons
319470	so you can see that there are some very
321060	sensitively laid out G keys this is
322860	again where I find this mouse to be kind
325260	of in-between fps and MMO if you look at
328260	the layout of the buttons on the Left
329580	there's enough that you could you know
331920	get some you know toots and toolbelt or
334500	whatever bindings going on in there and
336510	there's sort of more than you might need
338430	for a typical FPS you know if you just
340380	need push-to-talk throw grenade melee
342360	and that's about it but I personally
344880	think there's a really good balance
345810	because I can actually reach them all so
348120	while an MMO Mouse might make might you
350670	know you might want more buttons the
352890	reality of it is you're not going to be
354240	able to tactile II feel a lot of them
355740	anyway and this even with my smaller
357870	hands is very comfortable and very
359520	reachable which is which is cool so it's
362040	up to you guys whether sort of again the
363690	race to more actually makes sense or
365910	whether it doesn't on the top two more
367980	programmable buttons up here so these
369600	are by default bound to dpi so you have
372480	five different dpi settings right there
373890	1 2 3 4 5 works just the same way as
377220	many other Logitech mice do but of
378660	course you can remap them to macros or
380400	other functionality or whatever else the
382950	case may be
384570	oh yeah accessories right I guess that
388290	matters so there's they're included
389850	wireless dongle
390570	which is extremely low profile not their
392580	Universal receiver which can have up to
394290	6 different devices because this is a
396120	gaming grade one and then you've also
397980	got a little extension doodad here so
400290	you can plug
400710	get into your USB port and then have it
402540	sit somewhere a little bit closer to you
403950	mice if that makes you feel better for
405960	whatever reason so that's pretty much it
409320	guys I mean the only thing left is what
413790	do you oh yeah there's a battery
414810	indicator apparently right now that
417240	would be here of course um so the only
419040	thing left is what do you guys think
421260	what Mouse is this most similar to what
424170	would you compare it to and are you
426420	looking real closely at the gee 602
428190	right about now don't forget to
