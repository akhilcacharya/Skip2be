30	the m45 is both an uncomplicated product
3300	and yet one that I feel deserves its
5700	fair share of attention Corsair hasn't
8309	actually altered much from its
10110	predecessor the m-40 but that's why I
12929	feel like if I don't cover it it might
14969	get overlooked with its factory tuning
23850	and data center DNA and Intel 730 series
26490	SSD is an amazing choice for gamers and
29070	performance enthusiasts the m-40 is an
32640	excellent optical gaming mouse and at
34200	the time of its release
35370	even though Corsair had higher-end
36989	products I felt like it was actually the
39149	strongest offering in their lineup for
41070	FPS gamers from both a value perspective
43920	and even just overall it's a Vogel 3090
47460	sensor is extremely accurate and doesn't
50100	suffer from the acceleration issues that
51840	plagued modern laser sensors the m45
55079	picks up where the m-40 left off it has
57719	an upgraded picsArt pmw 3310 optical
60960	sensor that is widely regarded as a
62670	solid evolutionary improvement over the
65309	3090 and in spite of the branding change
67590	is actually made by the same folks like
69960	its older brother the m45 lacks some of
71970	the features of higher in mice like
73590	customizable lighting colors it's got
75840	two settings red and off and I'm sure
78570	there's other stuff but I can't remember
80040	any of it right now so obviously there's
82080	nothing missing that I personally care
83700	about some more buttons would be nice I
85740	guess but this is not an MMO Mouse so I
88110	guess the layout makes sense let's get
90270	into the important stuff the things I
91740	care about that it does have seven
93780	completely programmable buttons
95610	excellent ergonomics that allow for
97500	users with small hands to Palm and users
99990	with big your hands to claw very
101400	comfortably an adjustable weight system
103380	that lets the m-40 go from about 98
105420	grams to about 116 grams making it very
108149	light at the low end of that range
109979	Omron switches a high-mass scroll wheel
114180	that due to its metal construction
115619	really does have a more satisfying feel
118320	and finally the really nice textured
120990	finish of the mouse with soft touch on
122579	the top and then a fine sandpaper
124530	feeling plastic on the sides that is
126570	both durable and facilitates easy lifts
129419	without being uncomfortable to the touch
130889	dpi goes from 50 all the way to 5
133960	thousand in increments and fifty giving
135820	you pretty much as wide a range as most
138250	gamers will desire until we get to like
140020	8k displays or something and it's got
143200	three selectable profiles controlled by
145000	default with the top buttons here so you
146950	can change your dpi settings on the fly
148990	speaking of default key mappings Corsair
151840	software has come a long way since the
155380	launch of the m60 and m9 you know I'm
157510	slowing down to emphasize that you can
160000	create and save as many profiles as
162490	you'd like and store your favorite one
164140	on the mouse's onboard memory lift
166360	height has five settings from low to
168130	high the polling rate can be adjusted
170020	although just set this to a thousand
172360	Hertz or one millisecond and then you're
173740	pretty much good to go
174610	and angle snapping can be turned on or
177010	off but lacks more granular control
180270	acceleration and the number of scrolling
182560	lines for the wheel options are not
185620	included but those can of course be
188410	adjusted in Windows so I guess the one
190210	thing that really felt absent to me was
192610	the ability to remap or bind macros to
195400	the scroll up and scroll down
197550	functionality this is especially
199500	conspicuous dude of course there's
201250	actually really solid and easy-to-use
203410	implementation of button remapping that
205330	allows you to assign macros keyboard
206920	keys and even some cool canned windows
209050	functions like copy-paste close current
210760	window etc now as of today the m45
214030	pricing puts it right up against the
215920	SteelSeries rival and the Logitech G
217960	400s and $10 cheaper than the Razer
220570	DeathAdder 2013 making it very
222430	competitive the G 400s will be the
224830	obvious choice for gamers who prefer
227290	that classic Logitech shape and the only
229690	thing I feel that it lacks at this price
231670	point is a braided cable and 45s got
234040	that compared to the rival I prefer the
237220	textured sides versus the rubber finish
239320	on the sides of the rival and for
242200	compared to the death out of 2013 I find
244810	that the increased resistance of the
246550	left and right click on the top is
248350	preferable to the hair-trigger ones on
250780	the Death Adder but your mileage may
252790	vary and that is why all of these mice
255910	get to exist so personal taste I really
258608	like a lot of things about this one but
260970	there are definitely pros to the others
