6710	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9360	the logitech t6 20 touch mouse this is
12330	designed for Windows 8 and Bob them this
14940	basically Windows 8 compatible and you
16800	should use it with Windows 8 it has 6
18779	customizable gestures for the top of the
20640	mouth surface full touch design for
22800	smooth control a multi surface tracking
25230	ok so that means the laser or optical or
27930	whatever it is in there Laser laser
29189	great optical sensor okay so it's
31859	optical but it's a really good one so
33870	the optical sensor can track on pretty
35520	much anything you can scan the QR code
37020	to learn more it uses the unifying
39059	reciever so you can connect up to 6
40710	logitech compatible devices whether the
42570	keyboards mice remotes whatever else you
44430	want to do using that one little dongle
46620	in your computer full touch surface lets
48629	you naturally swipe scroll tap and click
50370	wherever your fingers rest glide through
52350	Windows 8 with intuitive gestures for
53850	vertical and horizontal scrolling Start
55530	screen access act switching and more
57570	smooth rounded shape for comfortable
59609	handling and gesturing and this shows
61260	you some of the gestures so there's
62579	vertical scrolling and horizontal
64769	scrolling back and four-oh back and
67500	forward swipes Windows 8 Start screen in
69810	the middle and then app switching where
71760	you can swipe in from the left so let's
73320	get this bad boy opened up and find out
75960	just how awesome it is we've got an 8
77820	Windows 8 notebook here so we can try it
79680	out pretty much immediately and I have
81990	no idea why that's there and I don't
85530	know what's going on here so there's
87360	double-a batteries so it runs off
88680	double-a so you could just use
89909	rechargeable doublea's but if it's
91439	anything like Logitech's recent products
93390	it's gonna run for like a billion years
95340	on batteries anyway so yeah it's been a
98939	long time since i've replaced any
100439	batteries on the logitech it's funny
101850	they don't call that out on the
102780	packaging or anything but so insert
104909	batteries attach battery door power on
106740	the mouse plug in the receiver and we're
108540	gonna do all that stuff and we'll be
109890	back in a moment there's a little guide
112350	in the manual showing you most of the
114119	functions but if you open up the set
115590	point software software software it
118110	actually shows you everything you can do
119430	so you can middle click I click the
122640	lower two-thirds of the touch surface
124920	with two fingers so I'll show you guys
126479	everything that we're doing so for
128369	example you can middle click to open up
130860	or to close a browser
133020	middle-click done so you just put your
135540	fingers there and you actually the whole
137190	the whole mouse only has one click and
141810	it uses the touch the the touch
144360	sensitive surface on the top to
146790	determine what you want to do so that's
148650	why this is a middle click this is a
152400	right click and this is a left click see
156720	that very cool so it just goes oh
158610	there's only something on the right side
160050	that must be a right click very very
163980	cool stuff okay so back to back to set
167070	point which I can access by maybe going
170900	actually I don't remember where we left
172590	that we left that on the desktop right
174830	okay so let's go back to start there we
179640	go back to the okay let's go back to the
187830	desktop and I really don't all right
190590	slick always hides a Start menu so
192450	that's why I'm having trouble with this
193530	okay so middle click here we go so
196680	double tap the 2/3 surface lower
199500	two-thirds of the touch surface with one
201120	finger you can set all kinds of
202709	different cool stuff
204570	so check this out double tap lower
206459	two-thirds and does it not like it if I
212160	pick it up oh there we go yeah
216930	apparently doesn't doesn't like that
218190	doesn't want to work if I pick it up but
219600	there you go double tap in order to
221459	start show will slash hide the desktop
223739	you can set something up if you want but
225450	we don't have anything stop switching
226920	applications is done by swiping from the
228900	left edge of the mouse with one finger
230310	so I better keep it here sorry the
233130	laptops not level which is making this
234450	hard there we go so I just swipe like
236340	that to switch between applications very
238590	cool stuff ok show charms is swiping in
242610	from the right edge with one finger so
244140	this will make accessing the charms menu
245610	a billion times easier then if you have
248820	to kind of go to the corner and then
251310	wait for it to pop up and then yeah so
253260	you just want to do that okay then for
255810	movement you can actually use it for
258180	vertical scrolling horizontal scrolling
260070	and back and forward so let's go to a
262440	browser so we're gonna do our one
265919	let's close that point and then we're
267719	gonna do our double click then we're
269759	gonna go to scroll over here you
273539	probably don't even have Internet
274860	Explorer here do you slick yeah you use
278039	night all right
279030	good for you with your Firefox pre-alpha
280919	there you go okay so all we got to do is
283620	you know go to some I don't know some
285180	page or something and then check it out
288180	so we showed you scrolling inside the
290069	Windows 8 UI now we can show you
292349	scrolling on a page just like that don't
294449	have to have a physical mouse wheel
295680	anymore no big deal and I accidentally
298560	clicked but it's okay don't let that
300360	sort of take away from the coolness of
302069	this experience and then back is done
304379	with two fingers to the left and forward
306689	is done with two fingers to the right
308129	which I have a little bit of trouble
310020	with I find forward a little bit awkward
311759	but I don't have much trouble with back
313710	it'll take some getting used to
315180	oh yeah I did it before there we go but
318150	it's a totally new way of interacting
319800	with to your computer using the mouse to
323129	enable the touch features of Windows 8
326279	without actually having a touchscreen
328650	monitor so thank you for checking out my
331259	unboxing and first look at I completely
334139	forget the model number now thank you of
336000	the t6 20 touch mouse from Logitech
339719	don't forget to subscribe for more
341039	unboxings reviews and other computer
342569	videos and I don't think I ever showed
344129	this but it has an on/off switch
346139	there's the batteries are sort of here
348900	and you can store your unifying reciever
351779	here if you want to use it as a notebook
353009	Mouse and sort of carry it around with
354960	you so you just kind of Chuck that in
356189	there and then you don't have to worry
357180	about it getting lost so close that and
360169	I don't think I ever give you a close
362339	look at it overall actually so there you
364110	go that's what the mouse looks like and
366689	then you can put it in your little
367500	carrying bag and it will be protected
369060	because it's a touchscreen surface or a
370800	touchscreen touch surface so you don't
372659	want to sort of wreck it and we're done
