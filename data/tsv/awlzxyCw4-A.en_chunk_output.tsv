6799	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9389	the Logitech for business BCC 950
12509	conference can now it comes in a very
14549	plain brown box because this is not all
17039	about the you know the fancy-pants
20250	packaging that've that a retail oriented
22920	SKU would would be focused on but this
25740	is all about the functionality enabled
27689	by this device and some of the really
29460	cool software applications that it can
31320	be integrated with so they say right on
33390	the package that it's optimized for
35579	Microsoft Lync Microsoft Lync is more
38550	than just sort of a regular consumer
40649	chat client it is it like an
43980	enterprise-grade chat client so it
46260	allows you to use things like instant
47879	messaging so this were used to things
50489	like just sort of person-to-person
51989	messaging this we're used to conference
54300	video messaging this we're used to but
56520	it also integrates with entire room
58469	video conference systems all the way
60510	down to the webcam built into your
63090	notebook it also has a lot of
64349	collaborative sharing stuff so it's
65640	integrated with things like OneNote so
67530	you can collaborate on that as you go
68909	while you're giving presentations in
70680	Microsoft Lync you can you know play a
74070	PowerPoint with sound and it'll work and
77280	so it works with I think it's I think
78990	link does up to 720p but this particular
81150	webcam is 1080p so if you wanted to use
83820	it with a different client then that
85020	would be fine
85710	due to the recent acquisition of Skype
88759	Microsoft Lync is also fully integrated
91200	with that so there's a lot of really
93150	really neat stuff you can do but what is
95009	the actual usage case for something like
97770	this and why is video collaboration so
99659	important I guess are the real questions
101520	that you may or may not be asking
102960	yourself so as companies I don't know
106049	outsource to different places or as they
108600	you know spread out and have larger
110579	campuses as they grow you need to still
113220	find ways to collaborate that don't
115229	involve getting in a plane and traveling
117450	somewhere because it's extremely
118680	expensive and very inefficient the
121229	amount of time that gets wasted sitting
123090	on planes is absolutely ridiculous so
126149	it's not that easy to take something
128758	like a notebook which has you know a
132180	very narrow angle lens
133860	on its webcam and it's usually not the
136260	highest-quality thing in the world
137520	although I'm not specifically picking on
139050	this notebook it was just the nearest
140400	one sitting here so crowding people
142740	around it to give a presentation or
144540	whatever else isn't isn't necessarily
146610	practical so this aims to bridge the gap
149280	between something like a full room
151320	conference system and something like the
153960	cheesy webcam that's built into your
155730	notebook so I'm just going to show you
157500	guys how it assembles and why it comes
161010	with a remote I think the remote is
162600	actually one of the coolest things about
163980	it so we go ahead a little stick that
166170	goes right here oh yeah it has a fully
167940	built-in speakerphone so that's that's
169800	neat as well because it's sort of a
171330	one-piece thing that fits in the middle
173580	of a conference room and then you don't
176190	actually have to have anything else
178770	sitting there I mean it looks sort of
180750	space-age and cool and then like the
185370	conference room at the at a place where
187590	I used to work there's like a
189450	speakerphone and then there's like sort
191430	of a random notebook there and then
193080	there's like another device and then and
195420	we're not even set up for for video
197220	conferencing yet so this guy right here
199140	replaces all of that stuff and then you
200730	can even use you don't have to use Lync
202350	because it's just a standard web cabinet
204330	uses h.264 encoding for video so it'll
206790	work just you can use it with anything
209160	whether it's FaceTime works with Apple
211320	and Windows whether it's Skype itself
214019	whether it is something more advanced
215700	like Microsoft Lync or Cisco's sharing
217890	software let's go ahead and plug it in
221370	just for lulz okay so let's do a quick
223290	product tour here there's volume up and
225269	down mute hang-up start call that's for
228239	the speakerphone functionality here zoom
230370	in zoom out as well as rotational
232650	functionality and then what you'll
234450	notice here is on the remote all that is
237030	built-in as well so you can answer and
239310	terminate calls zoom in zoom out move it
242310	around control volume and mute things so
245220	the remote is sort of the magical part
246989	because being able to move the camera
249600	from one person to another from one
252030	angle to another allows you to basically
253470	be sitting in front of it going okay you
255720	know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
258358	but then I've also got this thing on the
260160	wall over there that I'd like you to
261600	look at so go ahead and look at that
263160	zoom in you got your computer sitting
265289	next to you anyway so you're monitoring
267090	what
267410	vacancy is pretty much any chat client
270140	ever supports that and that's the
272960	scenario so basically it's a high
275240	quality webcam that's mounted to an arm
277790	that turns around goes up and down zooms
280460	in and out and has an integrated high
281930	quality speakerphone I think that if you
284930	don't see the application of this then
286940	you're probably not one of the people
288050	who could benefit from it but something
290180	like this can be easily deployed in
291740	something like I mean you know smaller
293990	organizations don't necessarily have
295760	eight different full-size conference
297860	rooms with full video conferencing
299750	built-in you know $500,000 thing so this
302870	allows you to take any small little
304520	office put a desk in it put you know a
307700	couple wiring jacks into it and turn it
310160	into a video conference room because you
312410	just put like a whiteboard on the wall
313790	you have one of these on the desk you
315560	have like sort of three or four people
316790	sitting around it and it's usable that
318200	way so I hope that pretty much covers
320870	everything you'd like to know about it
322040	there's also a headphone jack just in
323510	case you wanted to use that the whole
325100	thing plugs in via USB so there's
326840	nothing sort of unexpected there and
330100	slicks sort of telling me something oh
332750	it looks like you don't have to use the
334580	stick maybe that's what he's telling me
335870	so if you don't want the height adjust
338180	and you're just going to use it on your
339860	desk and you just want something that's
341270	sort of a fully integrated speakerphone
342980	webcam thing then that's an option as
345080	well I didn't even I didn't even notice
346460	that okay it still moves side to side oh
349430	oh
350360	probably yeah it probably still moves up
352340	and down in side to side that's very
353570	cool well there you go
356300	don't forget to subscribe Linus tech
358310	tips for more unboxings reviews and
360620	other computer videos it kind of reminds
362240	me of the guy from not Star Wars a new
363830	hope they've had the thing that comes
366200	out of the swamp when they get pushed
368060	into the garbage compactor it's like do
369650	two and then it just goes down
377160	you
