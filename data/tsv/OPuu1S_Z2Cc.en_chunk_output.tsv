5779	with its factory tuning in data center
8700	DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
11519	amazing choice for gamers and
13200	performance enthusiasts the corsair k 40
16890	spec list has got some pretty good stuff
18720	going for it it's got a 16 point 8
21119	million color customizable backlight
23550	with cycling and pulsing modes it's got
26130	n key roll over and anti-ghosting over
29369	USB which is no mean feat and it's six
32130	programmable G keys with three different
34290	layers of functionality can be
35910	configured through software or on the
38070	fly using the M R button just press it
40829	select a G key type in your combo and
43200	press M R again and on top of all that
45960	Corsair software which I just mentioned
48180	has gone from needs work to actually
51239	pretty good in the last few years and
53430	now we're at the point where changing
55260	the color scheme managing the profiles
57059	on the PC and the ones saved to the
59489	keyboards onboard memory and programming
61649	the keys with alternate functions or
62969	macros is leg free and happens in real
65760	time without any weird behavior the
68549	backlight configurator is especially fun
70619	to play with since it changes the colors
72540	and settings as you dink around with it
74850	but honestly I didn't find the backlight
78000	itself to be that amazing sure you can
80580	set it to whatever color you want but it
82680	isn't super bright and like I mentioned
85080	in my Corsair RGB mechanical keyboard
88110	coverage at CES it's one of those
90479	lighting systems that is theoretically
93299	capable of sixteen point eight million
94799	colors but in reality you can only
96479	achieve a handful of distinct vibrant
99990	colors now the keys themselves are not
102570	as linear like MMX black or red but
105119	reminded me of Browns if Browns were
107579	spongy or less tactile and generally
109920	more membrane II honestly it was a
111810	little weird going back to a rubber dome
113490	keyboard since I've been using
114540	mechanical for so long I'm not used to
117299	needing to bottom out anymore so that
120570	was an adjustment it didn't slow down my
123119	typing much surprised me but my wrists
126210	are noticeably more tired having used it
128878	for about a week at work I'm not sure if
131038	that's directly related to the switches
132660	but it's a knob
133380	servation nonetheless the keyboard looks
135510	quite attractive like coursers other
137340	offerings but uses a matte black and
140220	silver plastic body instead of a metal
142620	body with a shiny corsair logo the
145110	layout is solid I don't really have any
146910	complaints here and includes dedicated
149580	media keys to go along with a dedicated
152100	Windows key lock as well as a brightness
155160	key that goes from off to 1/3 to 2/3 to
157620	full strength on the backlight but one
160890	problem with the layout that I actually
162510	didn't even notice when just looking at
164670	the keyboard is that I found the F keys
167220	are too close to the number row for me
169650	it actually took me a couple days to
171240	figure out why I've been mashing f11 and
173790	f12 all week when I was reaching for the
175980	backspace all right so it's competitive
178500	landscape time in this price range
180990	there's some generic stuff like the
182910	gigabyte a via gkk 8100 which I actually
186060	used for a while and kind of like it's
187860	not a terrible keyboard there's some
189330	unique stuff like the Razer Deathstalker
191370	with its low profile chiclet keys and
193500	some downright goofy stuff like that
195930	cooling fan for your left hand on the TT
198540	eSports challenger but in my mind some
201960	of the biggest threats to the K 40
203610	actually come from Corsairs own lineup
206130	and from the fact that no matter what
208680	check boxes it ticks on a product matrix
211740	it is still a membrane keyboard and
214770	single color backlit mechanical
217200	keyboards like the Quickfire Pro and
219120	Poseidon can be had for a mere $10 more
222630	I mean guys the keyboard is alright the
225780	feature set particularly the RGB
227760	backlighting is competitive if you like
229920	membrane keys which some people do but
232530	well I can't complain about this product
234690	I guess if I had to complain about
236640	something I have a bit of an issue with
238650	the design philosophy here normally I
240900	wouldn't even mention this kind of thing
242490	in a review but kind of like the coach's
244740	son on a baseball team I've got to make
246540	an example of course there once in a
248130	while to prove I'm not favoring them for
249990	being a longtime sponsor the K 40 feels
252840	like a very corporate driven SKU from
255420	the ground up it is low risk it slots
258390	into a small gap in the product stack
260548	between the K 30 and K 50 it likely
263250	improves profitability at that price
264960	point compared to the K 65 compact and
267600	it ticks all the right boxes on the
269460	aforementioned product matrix against
271290	its competition but that's not supposed
273690	to be the coarser way coarser is
275820	supposed to be a bunch of enthusiasts
277650	who build the coolest thing they
278850	possibly can and then price it at
281190	whatever they need to to support their
282900	business and the K 40 just doesn't seem
285360	enthusiast driven to me with that said I
288210	can't go too hard on them because they
290400	are innovating in the category metal
292770	finished keyboards weren't mainstream
294479	until Corsair did it and their new RGB
297090	backlit mechanical is a quantum leap
299490	past what everyone else is doing for
301380	backlit keyboards so maybe that's the
303900	problem I mean if it seems like I came
305880	into this review with a bit of a grumpy
307650	mindset that must be the underlying
309810	issue I'm sitting here waiting for the
312090	RGB mechanical and they send me this to
314520	review in the meantime
315720	honestly it's fine but you give a hungry
318930	dog a pat on the head and you might
320460	appreciate the pat on the head it might
321840	be an excellent pat on the head but he's
323820	still waiting for his bone give me my
326340	bone Corsair I cannot wait you are
329310	sitting over there on the most amazing
331050	keyboard I have ever seen and I want it
333240	now
333750	guys we should start like a chant in the
335850	comments demanding the Corsair our GB
