230	now I've actually wanted to try this
2340	mousepad for a very long time one of my
4410	co-workers actually has one and swears
6899	by it
7560	this is the SteelSeries 5l and the 5l
11040	means 5 and the L means layers so this
15120	is a unique mousepad and that is
18119	constructed from both hard and soft
20660	materials for a unique gliding
23490	experience now I'm actually a cloth user
26730	for the most part I I prefer a little
28590	bit more friction but there are certain
30810	things I don't like about cloth like how
32579	quickly it wears out and I think I mean
34800	it could be a little bit improved so
36450	I've wanted to give this a try for quite
38610	a long time basically how this works is
41190	they start with a rubber with rubber
43770	junk at the bottom to keep it from
45660	slipping around then they have a hard
47670	plastic compound as the next layer then
50430	the next layer is a soft good poly
54210	isoprene ok awesome so that's layer
57030	number 3 and then they have a cloth a
59520	durable extremely strong cloth layer
61590	just over top of that and last but not
63989	least they put a thin plastic coating
66930	that gives you the texture of the
69240	underlying cloth which is what I like
71670	about a flock pad but it also gives you
73979	in theory the durability of a plastic
77400	surface now I'm gonna try and get the
79500	seal broken here so we can get the
81360	mousepad itself out I realized there's
83250	not a whole lot to unbox about a
84600	mousepad but once I've had a chance to
86580	gain with this one a little bit I'll try
88229	and update the video with annotations to
90509	give you my thoughts on it so first of
92970	all be fine pretty much nothing inside
95670	in terms of accessories hello there and
97700	I think oh here we go we've got a couple
100380	things inside the mouse pad itself so
102600	first of all we have their steel series
104850	product guide showcasing where you can
107640	see other steel series products great
109590	and then we have a SteelSeries sticker
112100	professional gaming gear and then we
114960	have a piece of paper - oh it covers AHA
119520	so this is the rubber like kind of
122640	textured it looks kind of like monkey
125280	art you know when they hold the paint
126630	and they throw it at the canvas it looks
128160	kind of like that so I
129679	chillie use pads with this stuff on the
131269	bottom before works very well for
132680	keeping it from slipping around and then
134900	let's have a look and here I don't know
137480	how well this is going to show we do
139430	have HD but I still don't know how well
141379	you're gonna be able to see it so you
142730	can see we have our rubber junk at the
144170	bottom then we have the hard plastic and
146450	you can see that's what gives this pad
148129	its rigidity is this thick hard plastic
150709	layer then we have like a thick kind of
153019	rubbery layer okay and then we get down
155750	to a much thinner cloth layer and then
158450	over the whole thing is kind of a is a
161629	plastic coating that's kind of it feels
164030	almost like a cloth that's been sprayed
166069	with that waterproofing plastic so I've
168349	been looking forward to trying this up
169760	for quite a while thank you for checking
170989	out my unboxing of the steel series 5l
174049	and don't forget to visit my blog at
