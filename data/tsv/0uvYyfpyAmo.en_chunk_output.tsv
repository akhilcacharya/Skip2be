30	so today we'll be doing a quick unboxing
1949	of the Microsoft Sidewinder x6 keyboard
4710	this is a powerful programmable gaming
8010	keyboard so the first question we should
9929	be asking is what makes this a gaming
12179	keyboard and the answer as far as I can
14880	tell is the art on the front of the box
17340	you can see we have a caveman with a
19590	spear
20310	if that's not gaming I don't know what
22230	is and then we have an arrow being shot
25199	by a guy and then we have a rhinoceros
28160	wielding an enormous sword is what I can
30869	as far as I can tell that's what this is
32880	and I wish I had a game with a
34710	rhinoceros and a sword because that
37020	would be the coolest game ever okay so
39120	why don't we get into the actual
40469	features here first of all you got a
41850	switchable keypad and I'm gonna get the
43200	cameraman to come look at these every
44550	time I talk about them switchable keypad
46649	means that you can move the number pad
49320	from either side of the keyboard
51210	depending on whether you want to use
52860	this with your left or your right hand
54629	it just clips in okay then you have mode
56789	switching you can manually change the
58890	mode of the keyboard and I believe that
60449	somewhere around here yep from either
62820	typing mode to one of two gaming modes
65549	okay then you've got macro keys which
67560	are located over here you can program up
69299	to 90 macros to these keys then the next
72720	thing you've got is cruise control and
74100	this is kind of a cool feature you can
75720	use cruise control to continue in action
77700	without having to hold down the key or
79080	keys assigned to the action so that
80729	means if you have a game that doesn't
82439	allow you to toggle crouch for example
84780	you could use cruise control in theory
86729	to keep crouching even when you're not
90299	pressing that key so it would be like a
91799	toggle switch okay then you have in game
93960	macro record which is neat if you have
95729	to record macros in game then you have
97950	WASD gaming cheese which is great
100680	because without those keys I couldn't
102450	type a wasted on this keyboard just
104759	kidding okay what you actually have is
106229	little lights on your WASD keys which
108540	will allow you to find them in the dark
109860	then you have a quick launch key okay
111869	for the Microsoft Games Explorer yeah
114030	cuz everyone uses that and then you have
116369	a two color adjustable backlight dial
118200	which is here so you can change the dial
120659	to more brightness or less more
122490	brightness and then you have media keys
124649	which are here and then you have a
126630	volume control dial okay
129479	okay let's go
130210	this keyboard open and break the seal
132940	right here so we actually recently
135010	unboxed the x8 gaming mouse which I
137980	guess would be the mouse to go with the
140350	x6 gaming keyboard the cameraman liked
142900	it he said the the tracking was
145030	excellent but the overall feel of it
147370	wasn't wasn't as look wasn't as good as
149620	he would have liked and he went back to
150940	his g5 so take that for what you will I
154180	didn't actually try the x8 so I can't
156130	really speak about it one way or the
157720	other okay inside here we will find the
159940	Sidewinder x6 keyboard manual so this
163030	tells you how to use everything how to
164380	plug a USB port and make sure you study
166090	this picture carefully before you buy
167560	this keyboard USB goes in excellent then
170860	you have a driver CD never use a driver
173050	CD always download the latest drivers
174760	off the manufacturer website and the
176740	Microsoft product guides they tell you
178120	about all the other stuff you could buy
179980	from Microsoft I guess actually this
182290	doesn't seem to have anything useful in
183730	it okay
184930	then you have the number pad so this is
188470	a little standalone number pad but you
190480	can't actually use unless you have an X
192310	6 keyboard so there's your interface
193870	here and there's your interface on the
195700	other side so we'll show you how that
196870	works in a minute but if you feel
198820	alright we're not the best but they're
200740	not the worst oh they have a calculator
202180	but that is the smartest place I've ever
203620	seen for a calculator quick launch that
205720	is exactly where it should be on every
207700	keyboard in the world because if you're
209800	actually using calculator with the mouse
211450	then you either don't do many
212590	calculations or you really don't care if
214840	they take so let's put okay here we go
224860	actually I should show you how this
225910	works so you just plug the little
227440	interface in right there now that's
229180	actually really easy and then to pick it
231010	off you just do that and then you can
233020	plug it in to the other
234160	oh it's magnetic oh that's cool check
236380	this out I can like slide it in wow
238680	that's really neat okay anyway I'm done
241480	playing with that now so the general
243310	layout of the keyboard is fairly
245500	standard which is always good for a
247570	gaming keyboard you never want to see
249220	something like a shortened shift key or
251140	you know an extra key down here or a
253900	shortened backspace key I personally
256120	like to see a very standard layout the
257920	keys don't have much travel which can
259510	also be quite useful for gaming because
261100	that means you're not pressing down
262730	a quarter of an inch just to get key
265160	register to register okay you find all
267500	of the macro keys the one is this one
271430	the continuous action key this is to
273200	record a new macro this is to switch the
274880	mode here are all your media keys this
277100	adjusts your keyboard brightness here is
278810	your volume control knob here is your
280670	glossy finish to the keyboard soon will
282860	be like the obligatory shiny look how
284540	shiny it is shot so there you can see my
286940	finger and that pretty much covers
289010	everything I wanted to talk about in
291410	terms of the Microsoft Sidewinder x6 so
293870	thank you for check oh I don't know what
295880	this does cameraman wants me to say what
297410	that does but I don't remember so thank
299840	you for checking out my unboxing of the
301730	Microsoft xx gaming keyboard
