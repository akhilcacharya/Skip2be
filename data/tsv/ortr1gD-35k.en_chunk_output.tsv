960	[Music]
5660	as you listened and implemented advice
10469	from NCIX employees on their MEC five
13799	gaming keyboards so this is from their
16500	levitron series of keyboards it is a
18750	mechanical keyboard and I'm not gonna
22500	say who the NCIX employees were but if
25920	there's anything you don't like about
26939	this keyboard then I hope that you have
29789	a keyboard yourself that is capable of
32130	writing Russian characters so that you
34380	can email the NZXT employee who is
36540	responsible for your dissatisfaction
40190	mechanical Keys the cherry black
42120	mechanical key switch is widely believed
43860	to provide the best gaming experience
45300	featuring a linear design ideal for rap
47370	depressing of keys on the right
48480	stiffness to help prevent accidental key
50340	press it also has a dedicated key for
52440	turning the Windows key on and off
53699	personally I don't use that but some
56250	people do has a numeric keyboard that
58199	can actually be attached and then
60000	detached to put either on the right or
62100	the left side of the keyboard which i
63449	think is kinda neat you can also just
64949	take it right off and use it as a
66960	standalone USB keyboard just by keypad
70290	which is kind of neat some people like
71460	those antique ghosting ensures multiple
73950	keys register when you press them
75180	simultaneously that's good
76470	modular design attached for modular
78869	accessories okay unlimited profiles
80159	created to save as many profiles as you
81780	like for maximum key customization
84060	require softens and that's cool because
86280	I can't imagine a reason why anyone's
88770	keyboard software actually has a limit
90689	to how many profiles but they all do and
93150	this one doesn't meet the add-on macro
95759	d-pad expansion allows for six
97140	additional programmable keys the
98369	expansion module rail enables custom
100860	position by sliding the d-10 left to
102210	right so I'll show you guys that after
103320	volume knob water-resistant remain
105689	functional even if accidentally exposed
107159	to liquid in such an event do not flip
108540	or shake the keyboard and the liquid
110610	will properly drain itself
115079	it's gonna be lifetime support by phone
117539	live chat email and including the
119670	warranty okay you can phone their
122789	support about your warranty but your
123960	warranty is three years here is the
127140	keyboard itself so you can see it looks
129209	like a no number pad keyboard when you
132599	first take it out of the box but then
134370	you will find all of modular accessories
137879	and hoo-hah that you didn't initially
140099	see once you take the keyboard itself
142019	out there's their packaging here is
146510	their extra USB cable which I will show
149190	you what it's for in a minute here is
151769	modular d-pad do dad do dad nice I
158870	satisfy even myself with my quirkiness
162120	sometimes alright we have the included
167790	software which you'll need for your
168870	programmable keys with unlimited
170430	profiles your Quick Start Guide which
172220	pretty much shows you how a keyboard
174989	works okay I don't think I'll be needing
176879	that and then we have so we had a look
181200	at the metaphor in fact slick pointed
184230	out fascinating a fascinating fact to me
189389	and that is that the MEK 4 was the first
192209	unboxing he ever showed me back when he
194760	was doing his job application so I
196920	thought that was interesting so here we
198750	are we've you've come to the MEK 5 and
200940	this will be the last unboxing he ever
202650	films with me cuz he's fired actually I
205290	only fired him once today usually I fire
207150	him multiple times in a day but then I
209250	always rehire him so he's not too oh
211079	he's not to put off by it at this point
212880	alright in terms of the cable that's
215069	included it is just over one full - arm
219060	span in length includes two wires one
221639	for presumably yes the built-in hub and
224069	the other for the actual data to the
225900	keyboard itself that uses a nice thin
227459	cable though I like that instead of like
229349	one of those super ridiculous cables
232200	just for the sake of you know having a
233760	couple connectors end up at the other
234959	end in terms of the layout of the
238470	keyboard we have what to me is the
242600	there we go we have what to me is the
245270	ideal layout where you've got your long
246770	shift long shift long winter and long
248840	backspace it does have two windows keys
250700	and no function keys however the fact
253010	that you have all these programmable
254240	keys which you can switch between A or B
256430	as well as the dedicated Windows key
259100	means this windows key shouldn't really
260779	bother gamers for the most part ah so
265550	they did not make the mistake of one of
268670	their contemporaries who also builds
270440	mechanical keyboards these are all
272180	mechanical and these are all mechanical
273730	mechanical neither mechanical this is a
276290	full mechanical keyboard with the couple
278540	of small exceptions being the volume
280850	dial clearly if you put a key switch and
284630	it would be stupid
286280	also the window is on and off and the a
289160	and B switch between these programmable
291980	keys these are also not programmable but
294650	it just depends on I mean whether you
296810	want to use them or not and what's cool
298520	is you can put them on flip it away if
300320	you don't feel like using it and flip it
301790	down if you want more macro keys to use
304250	during a gaming session so you'll have
305750	all of these and all of these or you
308330	just won't have them it actually slides
310520	on in much the same way as like you know
312320	like a sniper scope in fact oh look at
314630	this no they even have like shiny like
316610	glassy pieces on the sides and let yeah
319160	it's okay that's totally totally
320750	sniperscope inspired design and that
323630	looks like the rail that you can
327260	actually position it wherever you want
328520	so you can throw it over here if it's
330110	you know here that you desire to have it
332780	and you just put it here if it's here
334400	that you desire to have it it's totally
335690	up to you personally I'd probably put it
337490	right about there because I don't have
339140	much use for f1 and when I'm gaming but
342080	escape might come in handy and you never
343550	know when you might need f5 f5 is like
346700	my favorite key on the keyboard so I
349070	want to know it's not I'd like so I want
351230	to show you guys how this works
352130	basically there's a USB port there's
356150	your USB port and you put the thing into
359270	the thing and then it will sit on the
363200	left of your keyboard tada
364490	or you undo it
368430	or preferably with the switch on the
373450	bottom I put the thing in the thing
377880	preferably with the switch on the bottom
380670	hold that back over open up the other
384400	side and plug it in there and clip it
389470	into place I think it's cool
392230	or if you're one of those people in fact
394090	slick was just pointing out to me a
395980	little while ago
397120	the lack of mechanical detachable
400050	keypads because lots of people like to
402700	use the the shorter keyboards so the
405400	ones without a number pad for general
407440	use then they have their mouse then they
409420	have the keypad on the other side for
411790	like more efficient hand movement this
415000	is a mechanical keypad so it comes with
418420	it all you gotta do is plug in the USB
420730	cable and plug it into your computer and
422830	you have a full mechanical keyboard key
424630	pad including a dedicated calculator
427630	calculator button which I am personally
430030	a huge fan of it is also a very
431410	well-built one with nice long rubber
434140	pads on the bottom as well as two
436600	different height options in terms of how
439150	you want to lay it down on the desk so
440440	check this out
441160	you can either do what in which case it
443830	won't move you can do half inclined in
447580	which case that will actually move a
448930	little bit that's a shame or you can do
451210	fully inclined in which case it won't
452950	move this is probably the one I would go
454300	for cuz I like this angle when I'm
456190	typing on a number pad the keyboard
458080	actually has the same options as well so
460210	you can see here that it's got two of
462010	these where you can do either the full
463540	height the half height or the no height
467530	at all depending on what you're into
471180	wrist rest is oh look at that
473350	permanently attached wrist press that
475270	seems like the kind of thing I might
476440	complain about because it's less
477730	customizable but it isn't because every
479980	keyboard should have a wrist rest and
481710	the ones that are detachable tend to
484090	break so there you go I'm a fan Wow
489070	isn't actually really good has a volume
491410	knob
493160	it doesn't have a number lock light as
495320	you may or may not have noticed because
496550	it's on here that's just an FYI and
499280	that's kind of a cool overall aspect to
500870	a very very nice overall build feel to
505480	not a lot of flex to the to the deck of
508070	the keyboard itself then I'm impressed
512830	so thank you for checking out my
515210	unboxing the first look at the levitron
