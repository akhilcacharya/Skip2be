110	so I've got a pretty cool product here
2490	today this is the SteelSeries 7g this is
5490	their premium keyboard and it is for pro
10050	gaming yes you guessed it
11730	excellent so this is a no click
13469	mechanical gaming keyboard that means it
15089	uses all mechanical switches but it
17250	doesn't use the ones that have like a
19230	springy clicky sound to them when you
20850	click them so it should be in theory not
24750	quite as loud as something like an IBM
26880	model M but I mean it's not going to be
28740	as quiet as a membrane keyboard but you
31380	get that tactical feedback off it that
33300	you do not get off the lower quality
34950	keyboard wow that was really long and
36690	run ok 18k gold plated connectors for
39120	extremely low latency I'm not sure how
41790	that affects the latency but they do say
43890	gaming great durability 50 million
45629	keystrokes gold plated connectors will
48000	affect the durability gold is not used
49950	on connectors because it's a
51180	particularly good conductor it's used
53370	because it is a malleable soft metal so
56370	it is an extremely durable conductor
59129	wherever there are moving parts WASD etc
62460	etc etc this supports the use of all
64650	keys simultaneously that is a very cool
67650	feature very few other keyboards on the
70020	market support a feature like that ok
72810	removable super steady hand rest durable
75450	metal inner chassis and used and
77280	endorsed by the world's best eSports
78630	players SteelSeries media controls and a
80580	2 meter braided cord ok so at the back
82950	we're going to see a whole bunch of
84830	gaming associations that this is
87810	associated with and then we are going to
90090	open the did you look at this you're
92100	supposed to look at the gaming
93090	associations ok and then after that we
96360	will open the box so I get my knife here
98790	gonna cut my seal did it today ok here
103079	we go so let's get this out I love Steel
105420	serious products too I'm gonna give away
107070	my personal bias here almost everything
109680	they make I really really like so I'm
112409	fully expecting to like this keyboard if
114450	I can ever get it open see they tricked
115890	me you have to actually get rid of this
118979	seal in addition to the seal on the
120990	other side in order to get the keyboard
123630	to slide out there we go
125020	I wasn't see it's a good thing we have
126670	these instructional videos on how to
128258	open the box of the product because then
130269	how would you get this open you wouldn't
132160	be able to be challenging okay so I'm
135459	gonna just move and we're gonna start a
137080	focus on the keyboard here because it's
138730	so big that it's hard to fit both me and
141879	the keyboard in the frame here so let's
144250	take parts of ox I love black boxes too
147069	presentation very nice I give it a
149739	b-plus I've seen better but it gets the
153400	point across here is what you paid the
155769	big bucks for because this is a very
158290	expensive keyboard so I'm just going to
160810	take this out and let's have a look at
162519	what it comes with in terms of
163840	accessories and add-ons so inside here
166239	you will find a little baggie and it is
169209	full up a ps2 2 USB adapter now I
173140	believe the anti-ghosting feature only
174940	works if you plug it in by ps2 but do
177010	not quote me on that because I'm not a
178900	hundred percent sure ok and then we have
181780	a steel series case badge sticker ok you
186220	can stick that on your case then we have
188110	a steel serious professional gaming gear
190030	catalog that shows you a bunch of their
191680	other stuff which is also really good ok
194230	and then we have the 7g so this appears
197530	to be some kind of user's manual
199260	professional gaming keyboard oh wow this
201790	is oh this is the best diagram ever okay
204700	so can you can you see can you read this
206319	one professional gaming keyboard 2 hand
210579	rest damn just in case you could not
213639	figure that out that is how it works
216250	okay so as case Bond one of the foremost
219099	counter-strike players in the world
220480	helped with the development of the
222430	SteelSeries 7g here's one more than a
224290	dozen major international grandson he
226060	uses the following keyboard setup when
227530	playing his setup is optimized for speed
229359	and accessibility maybe you will find it
231040	helpful these guys take their
232389	professional gaming very very seriously
234819	and it comes down to yeah even that
237130	they'll give you tips on how to
238870	configure their product just like the
241180	professional gamers in the world use it
243220	okay so let's here's the keyboard itself
245440	we got our 2 meter braided cord here
247510	which is a very nice cord I wouldn't
250090	normally I wouldn't normally comment on
251980	the quality of a cord but check
254770	okay well if I can ever get it untwist
257079	I'd and then I'd be able to show you oh
258910	we got one more here really sorry about
261370	that so this includes all of the cables
264310	that need to be plugged into this
265450	keyboard in one little convenient cord
268540	and then it goes around so you look how
270550	long this is okay so it goes around to
272260	the back of your computer in another
273580	room I guess and then it has all of the
275860	connectors that you need so here's your
277270	ps2 you'll plug a USB to ps2 adapter
279910	into that if you want to use the
280960	keyboard by USB which works just fine
282820	there's your mic there's your speaker's
285790	because you have pass-throughs in the
287440	back of the keyboard so you can actually
289000	plug your headset directly into the back
291280	of the keyboard right there rather than
293260	plugging them into around into the back
294700	of the computer it allows you to use a
295960	much shorter cord if you also have a
297460	SteelSeries headset and then you've got
299380	another USB port this is for the USB hub
302310	ok these are actually labeled see this
304630	is keyboard can you see can you read
306730	that that's okay that says keyboard and
309010	this says hub so that you don't get
310930	confused because ps2 is not for a hub
313300	okay so then there's the keyboard itself
315490	now I'm going to get the camera a little
316810	bit close so that it can actually hear
318490	me more than see this so you can hear
323620	that these keys while not completely
325930	quiet are much quieter than a
328270	traditional mechanical keyboard with the
330340	with the spring sort of sound in it okay
332950	so you got a couple different features
334930	here first of all this Windows key gone
337120	this is now the SteelSeries key this is
339760	used for any of the functionality up
341350	here so if you want to mute the volume
343060	decrease it increase it play back
345550	forward that's used for all of that you
347920	do still have a Windows key over on this
349540	side they have done nothing goofy with
351940	the layout as far as standard layouts go
354070	the one thing I personally don't like
355870	and a lot of people do like this is the
358000	shortened backspace I have very small
360100	hands and for me to actually reach that
362050	backspace while keeping it's not going
364060	to happen so I like a backspace that's
366130	right here but that's a personal gripe
367840	these light up bright white they're very
370390	very very nice to look at it has a full
372370	number pad all that good stuff this this
376660	looks incredibly stupid I'll be the
378520	first person to tell you that but I
380440	actually already have one of these
381790	keyboards I'm just unboxing a new one so
383530	that I can unbox it for you
384820	I love this keyboard and the
386770	I love it has very little to do with the
389050	keyboard it's a great keyboard but I'm
390639	not that fussy about them this is it
392979	because this is the most comfortable
394900	wrist rest I have ever encountered on a
397150	keyboard it really supports you unlike
399910	some of the goofy goofy wrist rests that
401770	I've seen that are shaped or fashionable
403660	or whatever this takes functionality and
405580	just drives that point all the way to
408729	the finish line because it is functional
411460	and comfortable so with that sort of
413560	gushing out of the way thank you for
415210	checking oh oh sorry sorry sorry here's
417490	the USB hub it's a USB 1.1 hub so you're
420310	not really going to want to use like any
421750	high-speed USB flash drives or anything
423639	like that but it'll work just fine for a
425740	mouse and whatever else you need that's
427630	a that's a low power and low bandwidth
430030	device so and there's your built-in mic
432430	and headphone ports it has little
434560	rubberized grips on the bottom as well
436210	and one of the things they did mention
438669	is the metal frame inside so you can see
440259	there's actually very little flex to
441880	this keyboard and it's got well the box
444130	felt it's good it's got a lot of heck to
446919	it as well it's very durable feeling
448870	it's the kind of thing that if you like
450039	rain you throw it down it would be just
453039	fine
453490	thank you for checking out my unboxing
454870	of the SteelSeries 7g
