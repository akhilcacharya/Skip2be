30	now I already looked at the rat 7 on my
2610	channel and that was the highest end of
5160	the RIT rat series of well mice I guess
8910	they're rats if you want to be really
10380	technical about it
11370	ok rat kind of like that so that is the
14460	highest end from this series so now
16020	we're going to have a look at the rat 3
17550	which is the value rat Mouse so the
21390	first thing that stands out about the
22830	rat 3 is it lacks some of the
24510	customization options of the rat 7 it
27390	also is a lower dpi sensor so it is a
30990	3200 dpi sensor so let's have a look at
34440	what else se Tech has to say for this
36780	particular Gaming Mouse ok 3200 dpi we
39780	bought that next we have low friction
42629	PTFE slick feet alright so what I
45840	normally call slippy pads they're
47640	calling slick feet I guess either one of
49320	those terms will do and we have a gold
51090	plated USB connector to make sure that
52860	you've always got good contacts it's
54300	going to be corrosion resistant all that
56219	good stuff
56730	ok so 400 to 3200 dpi in 400 dpi steps I
60870	like that it's quite a bit finer than
63539	some of the other gaming mice that I've
64949	seen out there acceleration up to 10 G's
67580	polling rate is dynamic up to 500 or
70650	Hertz so that is 500 times per second
73110	tracking speed is up to 1.2 m/s Wow good
76140	luck moving a mouse that fast ok
78960	everything else here is fairly
80310	straightforward ok LED colors are red
82080	blue and purple for each mode alright
85549	cool nothing on this side on the other
88170	side we see oh yeah we already looked at
89700	this read map programmable buttons and
92310	create custom macros with the powerful
93869	ST software ok that's something I didn't
95820	see before
96270	for user-definable dpi settings and 9
99600	user definable commands via 3
101400	programmable buttons and a
103079	three-position mode switch ok so why
105000	don't we start getting this thing open I
107270	can figure out how to open the box I had
111090	a lot of trouble with the rat 7 as I
113460	recall so there's actually 4 mice in the
115470	rat series there's 3 the 5 the 7 and the
118350	9 so they've conveniently built
119850	themselves in enough room to do an
121950	entire upgraded series called the 4 6 8
124950	and 10 I guess so the main differences
128220	are in terms of how much customization
129899	there is ok
131950	the rat 7 you can change almost every
134680	dimension of the mouse even how much
137140	customization there is and what features
138459	it has so the rat 9 for example is
140980	basically a wireless version of the rat
143110	7 just in case they were wondering what
146680	is the difference between the night and
148180	the seventh
148720	so yeah this packaging is just a total
151540	bear to get open there we go aha
156459	so let's finally accessories here inside
158519	first there we go
161739	so cyborg so it's a state tech brand oh
164850	geez I believe for Mad Catz brand so
167830	sort of brand within a brand within a
170019	brand ultimately as long as it's good
173769	stuff it doesn't really matter okay so
175600	here we go cyborg gaming dot-com because
178239	uh here we go here's a summary look at
179980	that they're gonna make life easy for me
182580	okay so oh why so these are the
187120	keyboards okay so there's the clip
190299	cyborg keyboard they're just a fly okay
194080	oh no flies a joystick aha that helps
196299	okay product guy I love this okay so the
198820	three for user-definable DPI settings
201930	okay the five has 30 grams of removable
205750	weights I don't believe we're gonna find
207040	removable weights and the 315 user
209859	definable commands via five programmable
212590	buttons so there's one of the
214420	differences there at seven yes
216299	interchangeable pinky and palm rests for
219190	use of user definable DPI settings
220840	precision aim mode that one is the fully
224350	featured mouse and then the rat nine is
226709	the wireless version of that guy okay so
232480	let's look at the rat three Mouse and
234870	see what we think of it
239860	really okay they've fastened it with a
243320	twist I hear I was like I can't let's
245960	come out and then I realized why I came
248630	to move so they trashed the packaging
251480	you all right so let's see what we can
254150	adjust oh it looks like we do have some
256279	adjustments we have we have more
257870	customizability than I had originally
259370	thought so here we go let's have a
262430	closer look at this guy first of all
264500	we've got the hex key right here so that
269180	one is to slide this back and forth okay
273430	next we have a hex key over here and
278050	that one mmm how does that move it guess
285830	I'll have to figure this out off-camera
288040	okay so I have figured it out the rat
291290	three is not adjustable in any way these
293750	are to label the back and forward
296060	buttons so let's go through everything
297260	that is included on this mouse why don't
299600	we start with the forward and back
301760	buttons so these are programmable
303050	buttons you can change what you want
304670	them to do and that is a pretty cool
306950	thing okay here we have indicator LEDs
309650	for the DPI setting so you have up to
312290	four user definable dpi settings and you
315200	can pick the mode here that you desire
317780	okay and there's also a dpi adjusting
321380	button here okay this is rapid-fire this
325010	is your right-click which is not
326740	rapid-fire okay over here on the other
329150	side you have no buttons now unlike the
331670	higher end mice the rat 3 does not
333950	include like a metal plate on the bottom
336170	it is a fully plastic design you have a
339860	oh yeah you have a middle click as well
341270	as a mouse wheel should show you that
343070	this is just for show as far as I can
345470	tell it's kind of like a cool like
348670	cooling pipe looking thing that's built
352460	right into the mouse now it's quite even
354770	though it looks like there's kind of
355970	pieces missing and it might not be
357890	comfortable it actually fits quite
359870	nicely into like a claw type grip and
363320	the thing about that particular grip is
365780	it's pretty flexible you can use a small
367370	mouse whether you have small hands or
368780	big hands you should be able to hold the
371000	rat 3 fair
372230	comfortably for gaming so there's your
378520	laser sensor on the bottom and I forget
384950	how many dpi it is 3200 dpi laser sensor
389030	it's actually labeled right there good
390440	for me and there are your slippy pads on
393350	the bottom of the mouse including a very
394970	large one over your thumb because that's
397940	probably where you're going to be
399020	putting a lot of pressure
400190	if you hold a mouse anything like the
401870	way that I do so thank you for checking
403910	out my unboxing of the rat 3 don't
406670	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
408290	for more unboxings and other computer
410690	and gaming style videos with me as your
415220	gold plated USB connector look at that
419000	even has a little less cyborg logo on it
