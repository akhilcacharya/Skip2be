30	so today I'm gonna be having a quick
1890	look at the Microsoft arc Mouse now I
4470	unboxed the arc keyboard quite recently
7259	and while I had thought it was new it
9330	turns out that was one of my co-workers
10590	playing a prank on me I didn't even
12300	think to look it up and find out that
14429	the art keyboard is not a new product at
16320	all but I figured hey since I've you
18690	know gone and unboxed the keyboard I
20400	might as well do the mouse too so it
21990	works with Windows 7 Windows Vista
23340	Windows XP OSX and that's pretty much it
27119	as far as what it says on that side it
29340	is designed for comfort and folds for
31590	portability so that's pretty cool
33870	then it has a picture of the mouse and
35540	then on the back we find the mouse folds
38399	on a strong metal hinge to 60% of its
40860	fully expanded size the fully motion
43410	turns the most on or off and the micro
45719	transceiver snaps into the bottom of the
47280	mouse just like the keyboard I'm
48690	assuming the advanced performance
50340	includes laser tracking for precision
51780	and 2.4 gigahertz Wireless with up to 30
54059	foot range so something like this would
55410	be perfect like I said with the keyboard
57480	that isn't new for something like a
60719	media PC you know if you want something
62760	that just kind of you can sit on the
65729	couch it doesn't take up a lot of space
67110	that sort of thing so here is the mouse
69960	itself so it has kind of a neat shape to
72420	it and I'm still kind of puzzling about
74700	how to get the Box open like this almost
77580	looks like something that should sit on
78869	a retail like a retail hook if it had a
81360	little thing here and like where it
82680	would just sit like this that would kind
84930	of work for it to I think that's ok
86880	let's open it up ok in here they have
90000	the little test print tea thing
91590	ms color bar v5 ok that's not important
96930	alright inside we find documentation
100280	including the Microsoft product guide
102840	which tells you how to avoid damaging it
105810	how to select an appropriate power
107460	source how to use a mouse and keyboard
109530	without injuring yourself how to not
111509	look directly into the laser alright
113820	although useful information download
116280	software hey hey Microsoft has it
119070	figured out look at this they don't
120270	include a software DVD all you do is you
122549	download the software for Microsoft home
124409	slash hardware this is what I always
125579	tell people to do anyway
126869	brilliant ok so then that's pretty much
129869	all it has
130970	more information so you need to install
133070	the batteries insert the transceiver and
135020	then fold for portability when you're
136670	not using it so that's a very simple
138410	very simple setup guide there we go
141020	I don't know what's gonna be in here
143780	this is a mystery but you open this up
146420	and then inside we find batteries
151070	so this accepts triple-a batteries and
153140	it includes a couple of Duracell ones by
155330	default I'm guessing this pouch is for
157550	the mouse it's kind of a like a sweetie
160460	sort of leathery material seems
164660	reasonably durable there's like little
166370	stiffener pieces in the top and I'm home
169130	it's ha there magnetic strips look at
172700	that so that keeps the bag closed even
175730	though it's actually quite easy to open
177110	cuz they're like those flexible magnets
179000	very cool
179900	okay and inside here so I figured out
184340	how to get the mouse up you take these
186080	two little tabs you fold them down and
188090	then once you do that the whole plastic
191060	tab will fit up to the top and then the
193550	mouse will come out just like that that
195380	was simple okay so here at the bottom of
197780	the mouse we find the little USB
199130	transceiver which clips into place with
201440	a magnet so appropriate use of magnets
203660	on this particular product it's very
205100	very small and the mouse itself is
207380	actually also very very small cameraman
209239	just got an SSD so he wants me to
211610	compare it in size to his SSD which
213769	he'll be using to not take forever to
216019	load games while we wait for him and
217400	Leah in the lobby okay so there's his
219860	SSD and here is the mouse so here we
222500	have a scroll wheel we have a left and a
225019	right click so it's nothing too
226220	complicated as far as that goes
227660	the ergonomic shape is actually yeah
229700	it's not bad considering how small it
231650	folds up so why don't you take the mouse
233150	and put it inside the little pouch
234860	because that's where it's supposed to go
236209	so the mouse is going home there it goes
238489	and then you can close it up and then
241130	you can throw that in your laptop bag I
242690	guess it actually has quite a bit of
244459	strength even when it's folded like you
246170	you wouldn't worry about breaking it you
248030	can see how it's it's braced quite well
249980	against itself there so let me have a
252230	look oh it's got non-slip pads here and
254299	here so if you're using it on a surface
256790	where you know it's not particularly
258320	slippery you still don't have to really
259880	worry about that
260720	the laser is in not a centered location
262940	but I'm going
263639	go ahead and assume that it still works
264870	fine let's get the battery compartment
267030	open so if you were gonna install the
268770	batteries you'd put them in here and I
271439	think that pretty much covers it you
272789	know what before we before we wrap this
274919	up why don't I just go over to the
276449	cameraman's desk here next to his other
278819	Microsoft Mouse which I hate this mess
281639	it's so like laggy but this one seems
284999	like it would probably be pretty good oh
286349	it has another button check this out
287490	it's got what woman's gonna assume is a
290460	browser back button which in my opinion
292710	is an essential button on any Mouse
294539	these days I can't remember how I lived
296370	without it it's like going back to a
297719	mouse that doesn't have a scroll wheel
299490	like that's bad be the worst thing ever
301590	so it actually has four buttons one two
303180	three four so you can press the middle
306000	click it feels not bad I'm actually
308039	really surprised and I'm kind of harping
310199	on this issue but it actually feels
311789	surprisingly good the mouse buttons have
313919	a good clicky tactile feel to them this
316110	is a little bit out of reach for me like
317729	if I had if I had bigger hands you can
319770	see my thumb isn't even close to
321659	reaching that button but I don't think
323699	it'd be a problem for me if I had bigger
325020	hands either way thank you for checking
326430	out my unboxing and first look at the
328770	Microsoft arc foldable portable mouse
