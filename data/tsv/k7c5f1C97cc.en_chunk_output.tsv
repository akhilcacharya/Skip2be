6740	welcome to yet another by request
9690	unboxing I have received countless
12469	inquiries about the Razer Ouroboros
15980	Ouroboros Ouroboros whatever it means a
19619	dragon eating its own tail and it's like
21510	some kind of ancient symbol or something
24060	and basically it is their new super uber
28230	premium ambidextrous Gaming Mouse it
31140	comes in a similar to Mamba esque
33210	packaging that I remember caused such a
36329	Stewart stir back when the Mamba came
38640	out remember guys the Mamba was the
40739	first wireless gaming mouse that really
42870	performed like a wired gaming mouse even
45180	though it was Wireless so they're using
47969	a similar type of technology in this one
50190	where they're saying that you have the
52020	option of using it Wireless with less
53640	than one millisecond of delay remember
56250	guys most LCDs are on the order of ten
59010	to thirty plus milliseconds of delay so
61890	an extra one millisecond on your mouse
63539	is not going to be the difference
64920	between oh and put legs so bad
66869	versus oh it you know is fine and it's
69630	like awesome and just like the Mamba you
72450	have the option to run it wirelessly or
74720	you can charge the battery and use it
77850	wired at the exact same time were with
81270	the included braided cable so you can
82950	use it in wired or Wireless mode no big
85380	deal here's another thing I love check
87210	this out
87840	something that drove me crazy about my
89850	g7 I used two g7 for a couple years
92220	actually it was the fact that it had
93900	those stupid custom battery packs now
96869	you never ever have to worry about not
99840	having a battery that's charged enough
101670	to use in your mouse even once the
104220	batteries start to wear out so another
105840	thing that happened to g7 users just use
108659	standard double a battery and nickel
111240	metal hydride batteries will charge in
112860	the mouse so please be sure not to use
114930	anything other than a nickel metal
116369	hydride battery because if it starts to
118380	try and charge it it might be bad I
120000	don't know if it would I don't know that
121560	it would but I'm just sort of saying in
123479	general put in a nickel metal hydride
124860	battery it won't kill you
126000	alright experience the new standard
128038	position with the 4G dual sensor system
129989	outfitted with both a laser and an
131640	optical sensor to accurately calibrate
133050	the
133440	for exceptional surface tracking and
134760	customizable liftoff Heights there you
136560	go 8200 dpi crazy unrivaled gaming grade
141960	wireless technology means the Ouroboros
143460	it's a welcome okay yet we've covered
145320	that already three customizable parts
147420	more on this later and a bunch of other
150450	languages approximate size and weight
151800	and a bunch of things that we don't care
153240	about alright rays are so good at
155490	packaging let's see what they've
156450	included with this one we've got some
157920	Razer stickers we've got some Razer
161030	document elation that's not really the
164550	word for it at all alright what's this
167430	guy congratulations there's no turning
169080	back like us on Facebook and all that
170730	jazz there's a picture of the mouse next
172320	to a razor blade alright synapse 2.0
174900	synapse 2.0 is cool they have also
176910	updated synapse 2.0 since it came out to
180000	make it like way better because all your
182520	settings are still there even if you're
183900	in offline mode so when you're online
185460	it'll grab all your settings and all
187800	your games and all that cool stuff from
189360	the cloud and then when you're offline
191190	it'll just take whatever the local copy
193110	is so synapse very very very neat stuff
195570	it's kind of like valves valves cloud
198000	service where it remembers your game
199440	settings synapse remembers regardless of
202020	which computer you're on regardless of
203400	what games it is you just log into
205170	synapse and it remembers your macros and
207270	all that good stuff for you hold
209250	infinity in the palm of your hand ok
210870	yeah this is about the adjustable nough
212610	so will more on that after QuickStart
214890	guide product guide for other Razer
217170	products synapse 2.0 oh no this is just
220709	this product guide so venture oh yeah a
222180	bunch of good stuff in there including
223170	the software and then another language
225209	product guide now let's see if I can
227250	figure out how to get this bad boy out
228810	of here so pull this off okay which
231959	should you something yeah yeah there you
236100	go alright that comes out of there I
238350	remember with the lumbar I really
240180	struggled with it to get it off of the
242940	little pedestal that it was on inside
245190	the packaging so hopefully this one I
247500	can figure out it's been a long time
249600	since I did my Mamba and boxing but I
252060	hope this one is a little bit easier to
254670	to do ok yeah that's on there pretty
257310	darn good and see if we can figure this
259890	here out so there's a there's an arrow
261810	ah there we go
264810	that's not so bad
266790	okay it's not that heavy actually it's
268800	surprisingly light so once I figure out
271050	where all the stuff is I will be back in
273660	a moment and then I'll show you what
275760	makes this pretty much as adjustable and
278160	customizable as it gets on top of its
280380	outstanding performance so the herbal or
284240	Ouroboros is coming in as a customizable
289170	no so there's a few different parameters
291060	that you can adjust number one is the
294080	position of the palm rest see I'm going
296340	to go ahead I'm going to take that see
297660	how you can tilt it like that for you
299820	know a larger hand where you're going to
301440	palm the mouse and then you can also
304110	tilt it completely the other way now
306860	it's very subtle looking how the profile
310500	of the most changes when you adjust this
312690	but what I discovered and my wife and I
315900	were playing around with it
317040	off-camera for a little while here
318600	actually she's a very fussy fussy mouse
322140	user and as a my what we discovered is
325020	it actually makes an enormous difference
326880	to the feel of a mouse and we were able
329610	to get it dialed in to the point where
331410	both of us were like okay yeah because
333570	when I first handed her the mouse she
334980	went but then we played around with that
337860	as well as the length so you can adjust
339990	the length of the most here she has kind
341880	of long fingers and slim hands so you
344190	can go ahead and you just push this
345720	piece down right here okay and that
348660	disengages it from the track so you can
350010	go ahead and go click by click and
351390	adjust the length of the mouse so you
353010	can go from all the way to a size that's
355560	comfortable for me so you got my my
358020	small hands here see so that's that's
360240	comfortable for me and then you can take
362370	it all the way out to the point where
364710	slick could probably use it comfortably
366330	I kind of wish you was here to try it
367860	out for me but there you go
369360	so the point where I'll put my hand on
371040	the back of a mouse and my fingers
372570	barely make it to the wheel so you could
374400	have fingers that are you know this much
375840	longer than mine and you'd still be
377640	comfortable using the Ouroboros at its
380730	full length and then you've got about
382440	three adjustment notches in between
384690	those so that's really cool as well
386910	last but not least you've got magnetic
388590	pieces on the sides so here you can
390900	adjust it however once so you can go
392370	okay I'm a palm grip user I want my
394890	pinky to have something to rest on I
396810	want my thumb to have a rubberized grip
400380	and oh these are cool too so these are
402060	gear locks check this out so it's again
405120	if this mouse is totally ambidextrous
407130	you can adjust it either way for
408630	left-handed or right-handed use so what
412110	these guys do is particularly with the
414210	grippy sides in place they allow you to
416310	adjust your dpi while you're holding it
419580	down so you can lock those buttons off
421500	so you can put as much pressure as you
422910	want to lift it off the mousepad or
424590	whatever else you want or you can unlock
426660	them so they turn into a button you can
429900	go okay don't fit at the duck full speed
432000	hold down sniping at load at at low
435720	sensitivity let go and you're back to
438150	full speed this is a hundred times
441870	better of an implementation versus mice
444780	like akari laser where you got a button
446700	here that toggles your dpi this
450260	is not easy to hit in the heat of battle
453090	whereas this is part of your natural
456870	movement and you can do it as easily as
459480	anything else so I I'm actually I really
462180	like that particular feature I'm going
463590	to go ahead and lock these off for now
465270	and again you can configure it
466890	completely the other way these are
468570	magnets so they're super easy to put in
470700	place but they won't come off
472050	accidentally you have to kind of fight
474090	with them to get them off so will not
475980	fight with them but you have to you have
477270	to mean it okay so same thing you can
479370	adjust it for left-handed use here now
481290	if there was something that I had to
482700	complain about with the shape of the
484740	Ouroboros it would be that I don't
487650	really have a place to put my ring
489930	finger so here watch this guy so I'm
491760	just going to go ahead put this on the
492780	mousepad here so you can see so my thumb
496530	I can rest here or I can adjust it with
499380	the rubberized grip and I can rest on
501930	that if I'm more of a claw user and I
503520	want to hold the mouse like that I can
504810	even do this and I can I can call the
506820	most like that go ahead and adjust this
508800	in lots of different ways to use it
510960	whether you're a palm user or claw user
512640	this is probably how I'd use it as a
513780	Chloe's or bring it down nice and short
515490	and then use it like that alright so I
519030	can rest my thumb there with either of
520469	those options index and middle finger
523260	those are fine pinky finger I can either
525630	rest right here on the little wing or I
528120	can throw this guy on again and I can
530090	I can use it as a clog grip I don't
532760	really have somewhere to put this finger
534140	so it tends to kind of fall down here
536600	where it gets caught on the sharp piece
538100	right here this sharp piece right here
539750	it tends not to really be able to reach
541940	these two buttons on the other side of
544070	the most of this contrasts with
545240	something like a SteelSeries sensei
547010	where you can actually it's ambidextrous
549980	and it has front and back buttons on
551960	both sides but you can actually reach
553340	those on the other side whereas these
555170	ones are positioned a little bit further
556610	back which i think is a function of the
559220	adjustable nature of the mouse where if
561200	you were pulling it all the way back
563410	well that's where they would need to be
565610	to be comfortably used and if you put
567440	them way up here that user with their
569570	palm at the back of the most like this
570800	wouldn't be able to reach them so in
572450	order for everyone to be able to reach
574040	them for us small handed users it
576470	becomes sort of a non optimal location
579050	where I can't really press these
580760	comfortably with my pinky and these ones
583340	with my thumb are sort of more of a a
585380	base of the thumb and then middle of the
587690	thumb buttons
588350	whereas on something like a g9 these are
592100	middle of the thumb tip of the thumb
593570	buttons and same for an Akari laser so
596510	the reason I have a g9 in an Akari laser
598250	here those are my favorite mice one of
600470	them is more of a claw grip Mouse for me
601970	and the other ones more of a palm grip
603260	Mouse for me and I wanted to take this
605390	jack-of-all-trades and compare it to
607190	what I consider to be the Masters of
609760	those particular trades all right so
613340	back to the buttons that are on the
615140	mouse oh you got your left your right
616100	mouse button your scroll wheel really
618380	nice scroll wheel on this guy you see
620000	those raised bumps right there very very
622100	comfortable nice soft rubber really good
624410	grip love it sensitivity up sensitivity
627530	down adjustable palm rest from your
629660	panel that we've already been through so
631250	here are your one two three buttons on
634460	each side one two three you can program
637430	all of these in the synapse software
639290	don't forget that guys next you've got
641570	those gear locks that I showed you
642860	before em is ultra stick now ultra light
646820	ultra stick mouse beat you put it down
649220	in your pad you can't move no I'm just
651590	kidding ultra slick so you got them here
653720	here here on the bottom of the wings and
655870	on the bottom of the magnetic
658600	removable pieces here so those are all
660430	over the bottom you've also got KK rear
663010	panel button and recliner wheel yep yep
665820	8200 dpi sensors 1 2 and rechargeable
670630	battery USB connector yes USB connector
672850	cable so if you want to plug that baby
674140	in all you do is go like well something
678640	looks like it locks into some sort of
681580	piece of something there it goes
682930	gold-plated so it's good stuff
684640	you've got a nice braided cable here so
686770	you shouldn't have any issues with that
687970	again gold-plated connector on the other
690100	side it's funny they gold plate this
691420	part but the only part that actually has
692770	to be gold-plated is the connectors
694180	inside but I think it looks more lib
696190	duelling that way so I can understand
698110	why they do it
698740	charging four hours four hours gets you
701020	to 90% battery that's really cool so
702580	it's kind of like the it's kind of like
704140	my iPhone 4 where I can give it a quick
706120	zap and I can get back going pretty
708220	quickly but it actually takes quite a
709570	while to get to full charge so 4 hours
711820	for 90% eight hours for 100% that lasts
714790	a little bit takes quite a while and
716140	there's instructions here on how to
718680	actually take the battery out so you
722140	slide this bad boy up and you go ahead
724330	and load the battery in there just like
726160	that oh and it glows green folks very
731620	very nice so you've got green glowing
733360	accents here here and here and here
737250	which looks really really really really
739570	cool and we're going to go ahead and put
742120	that back we're back where I want it and
744310	I want the warmth of wing over here I
746860	love how quickly you can adjust things
748210	on it I mean you've got other adjustable
749830	mice I mean things like g9 is adjustable
751810	it comes with two different outer pieces
753850	as well as adjustable weights but it
755980	takes like you know you don't like take
757360	this off and take go get another one
759520	it's kind of a pain whereas this is
761770	actually you know you can have all the
763870	pieces on and off with magnets basically
766030	so Wireless knob yeah I don't think
768430	we're I don't think we're really missing
769660	anything here how to pair it you press
771280	the button press the other button not a
773230	big deal so you know what let me connect
776110	it and I'll have a look at what I think
777100	cuz I was super stoked on the g600 from
779620	Logitech it looked like the perfect
781300	ergonomics for me still loved the
783130	ergonomics of it great button layout but
785470	the sensor just felt laggy so I'm going
788080	to go ahead I'm going to install the
789280	drivers for this guy let's see what I
790570	think so if you guys were wondering
792310	what 8200 dpi looks like I think we
795190	really have reached the point where
796510	we're at the limit of how much dpi is
798040	needed I have my mouse pointer up in the
800200	very top left corner I move the mouse
802330	that much it's in the bottom left corner
803940	did you even see how much me love watch
805990	I'm going to do it again magic trick
807220	okay bottom left top right so I think
811960	that's a little bit on the high side for
814089	me personally but you can adjust the
816490	stages so you can sort of go did it that
818920	and you can configure where you want the
822240	various there we go configure
824260	sensitivity stages you have up to five
825910	stages so it's at 800 1800 4000 6400 etc
829360	etc I find with higher resolution
831370	monitors you do need the higher dpi
833080	settings but this is just a 1080p
834700	monitor so something like 800 to a
836950	thousand would probably be absolutely
839080	perfect for me
840279	you can adjust in 100 increments there
842980	we go
843430	yeah thousand looks like looks like the
846310	magic bullet for me bunch of other stuff
848290	you can customize including what all the
849730	buttons do as well as oh yeah you can
854050	see the side views of the mice there you
855820	go top view side view performance yes
858339	acceleration keep it off and less out of
861100	knowing some kind of person who likes
863530	acceleration not that I'm generalizing
865770	lighting bright normal ah you can change
868330	the brightness you can go 400 K in
870670	Wireless mode you can turn them down
871930	just to make sure that you don't drain
873310	your battery with the lights surface
875140	calibration turn that on others add mats
877990	lift off range you can change that as
879670	well as power settings so when does it
881920	enter sleep mode after idle flash the
883510	battery indicator when the battery falls
885100	below 5 10 15 20 or 25% gives you lots
889120	of good oh and macro programming so this
891130	is all done within synapse and synapse
893110	will go ahead and make sure that
895240	everything is you know taken care of for
897459	you so what do I think feels alright I
901510	mean I for me its mice never come down
904810	to spec they come down to how responsive
908890	does it feel does it feel right yeah you
915820	know other than not knowing where to put
917200	my ring finger I think we're I think
918730	we're in good shape with our Ouroboros
922060	however one thing that I did get tricked
924250	by and as a seasoned unboxer I'm
926380	even wear a shirt that says a
927520	professional unboxer on it I'm feeling
929740	pretty ashamed of this but I unboxed a
932620	wireless mouse without actually managing
934780	to find the wireless base station which
937510	is here so it's a weighted base station
943060	it's got a rubber grip on the bottom so
944350	it's not going to go anywhere you can
945970	put the plug into this bad boy just like
950890	that and then you can drop the mouse on
953080	there for your charging purposes just
955480	like that thank you for checking out my
958780	unboxing and first look at the Razer
