4910	the corsair carbide air 540 high airflow
7980	cube case is great for air cooling or
10019	liquid cooling check the link in the
11639	video description to learn more now i've
13950	recommended this mouse any number of
16049	times this is the original razer naga it
18449	has 12 MMO buttons on the side the only
20490	criticism of which would be that they're
22080	kind of mushy and kind of hard to
24390	distinguish from each other it included
26099	little pads that you could put on them
27750	but i personally never even ended up
29550	applying them I didn't find they were
30779	that helpful and includes an ergonomic
33480	shape that I personally really really
36120	liked it also tracks like a dream and
38250	I'm done gushing about the Naga because
41390	there's the Naga razors really got to
44489	figure out their product naming scheme
45960	here because it can between this one and
48780	the Death Adder 2013 in Black Widow 2013
52289	and the Death Adder was like how do you
54329	make you know how do you improve on
55920	perfection you don't change anything but
58320	then it did change things and then there
60270	was no reference to it being a 2013
62250	edition anywhere on the blocks except
63780	for like one little like spot somewhere
65580	and so this is called the Razer Naga not
69030	to be confused with the Razer Naga
70710	they're taking the same approach it said
72630	it's funny it makes perfect sense
73890	because as a company that's all about
76170	you know gamers and gaming they've taken
78240	a page right out of game developers
80009	handbooks OH
81720	what should we call the new Tomb Raider
83220	let's call it Tomb Raider so anyway
87900	there you go that's my rant about that
90150	what has razer improved about the
93720	all-new Naga well they've done a couple
96030	of things that I think are a very big
98130	deal number one is they have changed
101040	these buttons on the side to be
103409	mechanical buttons so I want you guys to
105450	really hear the difference here I'm
106890	going to hold it up to my lav mic
109040	original Naga very mushy very membrane
112890	II new Naga very clicky very tactile
117719	really really like that
119610	they have also updated the ergonomics so
121920	gone are the two buttons right here
123990	which I never really liked anyway I had
125969	I rarely find myself in a situation
127799	where this is a comfortable movement for
130500	me those were the two buttons that I
131760	really
132060	had trouble reaching and they have
133620	instead put two buttons here
135840	these can be actuated with the middle
138120	finger which if you use a three fingers
141300	like this sort of orientation then at
143280	least there's that you can kind of reach
145020	I personally have trouble at this one I
146580	don't have very flexible hands but at
147900	least now I can reach one of them
149280	comfortably they've also added a tilt
151500	click scroll wheel so this and this are
155069	additional function so it now has a
156569	total of 19 buttons twelve on the side
159840	two on the top well one two three four
162900	on the top and then an additional two
164940	here giving you like I said well plus a
167250	middle click so that is a total of
169110	nineteen buttons they have implemented
172380	their low friction of quiet pads on the
177269	bottom which i think is kind of unique
178620	they have also updated the sensor so it
180959	now uses an 8200 dpi 4g laser sensor and
184310	check this out here we go here we go
186299	there we go there's the naming scheme
188190	this is the Razer Naga 2014 so they've
192150	gone with the car approach now where you
194160	actually buy next year's model in the
195900	previous calendar year and of that is
198450	the way it works which isn't to take
199890	anything away from the mouse itself one
202260	thing that's improved on the top is well
203850	that they didn't have in their kit but I
205470	can already feel is the grip enos of
207989	this top surface here instead of having
210510	a soft touch feel it has a very mild
213420	lightly textured feel that I find quite
215880	appealing and makes it less likely to
217950	slip they've also updated the color
219959	scheme whereas the old Naga was blue the
221730	new Naga is aligned with the latest
224130	Razer branding which is green so there
227250	you go all of the buttons on the side
228810	are illuminated the Razer logo is
230730	breathing by default although you can
232109	reconfigure that in synapse and the
234090	mouse wheel itself looks absolutely
235590	outstanding in green something else that
238980	they've done with these side buttons is
240750	they've changed the shape of them
242010	significantly so you can see the way
243660	that the older ones work you were
245400	expected to find the difference in them
247139	simply by feeling these bumps right here
249750	but other than that they're configured
251489	very similarly now they have changed
253950	them significantly so some of them are
255810	arced this way some of them are arced
257700	this way the middle Bank okay so you can
260608	I want you to see this from the side
261690	maybe we'll do some macro footage here
263190	but they're all angled really
264539	differently
265310	in such a way that you can really feel
266780	whether you're on pads 1 to 6 or pad 7
269750	to 12 and then from there these ones the
272840	middle ones have ridges on them that you
274610	can really you can really feel they're
276530	kind of sharp along this edge this edge
278180	this edge and this edge allowing you to
280580	more easily figure out what button
283010	you're actually touching is it
284660	necessarily perfect the answer is
286550	probably no but I think it's difficult
288080	to put 12 buttons on the side of a mouse
290120	such that you're expecting anyone to be
292100	able to find them all in the heat of
293900	battle without any practice but once you
296150	have practiced I've heard people say
297860	even about the original Nagas that it's
299570	not that difficult now in terms of
301490	updated ergonomics you can see the mice
303050	look quite different the one complaint I
305450	heard about the original Nagas quite
306889	often was its really small which is
308510	great for me because my hands are small
309979	but there wasn't much room to rest your
312080	pinky and your ring finger on it that
313639	has been changed the Nagas 2014 has a
316580	much expanded pinky and ring finger rest
320240	and what I really like about the pinky
321979	here was there was nowhere to really
323660	rest it on the original Naga it was a
326060	glossy smooth surface they've added a
328220	rubber grippy serviced surface just like
330440	the Death Adder 2013 with the rubber
332539	grips on the side I think they're a huge
334280	improvement and I love it I don't
336229	necessarily need to put my pinky down on
338419	something but having a rubber grip is
340640	much more comfortable to me than trying
342650	to squeeze the mouse to have it to have
345830	my pinky stick to it particularly when
347630	you consider that on the other side of
349460	the mouse are a bunch of buttons so if
351050	I'm squeezing too hard here I'm going to
352760	accidentally press them
354020	speaking of which side of the mouse okay
356870	they didn't send me one so I'm having
358340	you look at the mouse but it's totally
359630	pointless razer has a left-handed
362240	version of now both of their most
364280	popular gaming mice the Death Adder as
366680	well as the Naga so that was a
368660	crowdsourced initiative kind of thing
370669	that razer did and i can tell you from a
372800	business perspective it makes no sense
374300	to go through the molding and tooling
376490	that is involved in releasing a
378350	left-handed Mouse when you consider how
379760	few of them sell remember I worked at a
381620	retailer before I know how many of them
383479	sell isn't very many but for you
385910	southpaw guys out there
387680	there you go razer was listening and
389210	they wanted to bring you a left-handed
391039	mouse so kudos to you I think that makes
393979	it the only left-handed MMO Mouse I
396020	don't believe any of them are
397840	and be dexterous because of the way that
400030	you have to lay out MMO buttons for them
401740	to be mostly accessible using the thumb
404290	which is the most the most flexible of
406750	the fingers that you're probably using
408400	for it software wise they've made some
411340	more improvements here as well so
412570	there's an animal configurator that
414130	actually overlays on the screen so you
415930	can use it to respec in the middle of a
418449	game without actually even all tabbing
420070	out and this one for me personally is
422020	actually cooler because I tend not to
423639	change around characters too much I play
425830	mostly single-player RPGs when I am
428740	playing an RPG such as Dragon Age or
430479	torchlight 2 and this is really neat so
433630	they take this grid of 12 and then they
436419	actually give you a screen overlay that
438430	you can set up different icons so you
440710	can see visually on the screen is an
442810	overlay what each of these is mapped to
444970	I think that's absolutely outstanding
446650	because a big problem for me with 12
448060	buttons particularly when you're going
449440	from game to games what the devil did I
451419	have button seven bound to camera if you
454300	can't remember no big deal taking care
456280	of that with a screen overlay and I
458350	think that pretty much does it I liked
461260	the Naga hex with its six mechanical
463210	buttons and it felt like an improvement
465130	over the original Naga with 12 buttons
467919	well now they've taken those mechanical
469479	buttons and between the Naga hex and the
471760	Naga 2014 edition you should have
473590	something that you'll pretty much like
476020	the wider shape addresses the issue I
477820	think for people with larger hands
479320	although if you have baseball glove
481120	sized hands it might still not be the
483220	perfect Mouse for you but they've
485260	definitely improved the appeal and there
487690	you go
488139	what can you improve about something
489250	that's already awesome make it just a
491020	little bit more awesome thank you for
493599	checking out my unboxing and overview of
495580	the Razer Naga 2014 don't forget to
498070	subscribe don't forget to like this
499330	video if you enjoyed it and let me know
501190	what you think I mean just even looking
503169	at it you know seeing some of the some
505000	of the close-ups of my hand on it has
506680	razer improved the Naga by making it a
509020	bit of a wider stance more compatible
511660	with larger hands Mouse and adding the
513549	mechanical buttons or would you prefer
514958	to grab an original Naga now so you
517479	don't have to stop using it in the
518770	future thanks guys
