30	for 30 years Cherry MX key switches have
3360	reigned supreme in enthusiast and gaming
6210	keyboards but as much as I love
8220	Neapolitan ice cream
9599	I think after eating it for 30 years I
12389	might be ready to at least try something
14580	new and apparently Razer Logitech and
17600	SteelSeries feel the same way because
20220	each of them has released mechanical
22109	gaming keyboards in the last year based
24300	on a new made for gaming key switch by
28260	the way drop us a like on the video to
29820	let us know if you're ready to get your
31289	cringe on in the next part of scrapyard
33840	Wars 2 coming in 48 hours
45560	freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
48240	solution that lets you get organized
49920	save time and get paid faster click on
53070	my face now to try it for free so let's
56700	get this out of the way now
57750	while it was co-developed with chi-wah
60570	the famous manufacturer of Cherry MX
62910	clones the qs1 switch in the apex M 800
67290	bears little resemblance to cherries MX
70230	design and any similarity to the omron
72750	and Logitech co-developed Romer G seems
75450	to be purely coincidental qs1 switches
78270	are totally different feeling from
80250	anything that i've personally used
82140	before but I'll have to return to that
83820	in a bit the apex M 800 has two braided
86580	USB plugs for extra power a built-in USB
89040	2.0 hub at the top and interchangeable
91979	rubber feet on the bottom to change the
93720	angle on the desk like the original apex
96690	and apex raw rubber dome keyboards the M
103550	802 and this goes for both the key
107340	switches underneath and the key caps
109920	especially when you compare to the
112050	stair-stepped profile and contoured key
114990	caps of most mechanical keyboards this
117990	was done for a couple of reasons number
120090	one to slightly reduce the travel time
122850	between keys although neither ed nor I
125250	was elite enough for the reduced
127229	vertical distance to help in a
128460	noticeable way and without help from the
130770	bump on a four double bump on W it did
133260	make it more difficult to determine what
135510	row of keys you were resting on and
137430	number two to reduce fatigue something
140700	that I personally find a bit easier to
143160	buy into since particularly for gaming
145290	the m8 hundreds low stance reduces
147840	pressure points for me in spite of its
149850	lack of a wrist rest with my lazy
152130	resting a lot of my weight on the table
154260	posture and the spacebar helps with this
156990	hand position as well I still don't like
159150	it for typing that'll be a common theme
160950	for this video and thanks to the very
163319	low 45 gram actuation force of the qs1
166140	switch under it is actually possible to
167880	accidentally press while resting on it
169950	though not nearly as bad as the death
171150	out of 2013 but for gaming spamming
174540	spacebar and just general use there is a
177460	season that two and a half years after
179140	SteelSeries first introduced this
181390	spacebar to their gaming keyboards this
184060	design unlike the macro row above the F
186640	keys is still here it is better and more
190120	comfortable but let's talk macro keys
192460	now the six macro buttons to the left
194470	are really well spaced so they're within
196930	reach but far enough away that you won't
198730	accidentally trigger a console command
200920	to change the name of every non clan
202420	member in your server to headshot magnet
204460	every time you want a Crouch and no you
206800	can't actually do that but you can do
209890	almost anything else
211690	SteelSeries Engine 3 might have
214330	ballooned to the size of a several year
216400	old graphics card driver but damn it I
219070	guess they've got enough functionality
220630	in the thing to justify it there's one
223300	processor in the keyboard dedicated to
225340	just inputs up to 256 of them at a time
228760	just in case you thought your
230160	other-dimensional clone might also want
232390	to press every single key on his and 800
235210	at the same time you are and then a
236890	separate processor to handle lighting
238810	effects so the utility of the keyboard
240940	is never affected by the bling bling and
243190	every single key on the keyboard
245260	including those macro keys is
246790	reprogrammable and can be rebound to a
249580	keyboard function mouse click some
251770	combination of the two a modifier a
253660	profile changer u so you can switch up
256209	everything on the keyboard mid program
258220	instead of relying on auto profile
260290	switching when you launch an application
261670	which Engine 3 supports as well and I
263830	didn't think I'd ever hear myself say
265840	this but SteelSeries has finally nailed
268390	it it's the easiest customization
271090	interface I've personally used for a
273670	keyboard and they managed to do it
275680	without hamstringing the functionality
277920	good job and it looks like they've done
280660	a great job with the illumination
281890	effects as well with all the standard
283960	fare like breathing reactive typing but
287410	also some nice little touches like three
289570	different modes of selecting which keys
291490	you want to configure including a handy
293200	little magic wand that intelligently
294820	grabs keys that are already grouped and
296290	some really sick pre-done effects
298270	including a Danish flag and nyan cat
301030	inspired waving rainbow both of which
303040	made me smile they've also added cloud
305470	sync to the driver but it's entirely
307450	optional so you don't even need to
309190	create an account you
310169	just exit it when it first comes up and
311879	I think that's a really nice touch okay
315180	so we beat around the bush long enough
316590	let's talk qs1 switches like the Romer
319199	G's cue s ones are not going to be
321509	compatible with Cherry MX 10 key caps so
323999	forget about customizing the key caps on
325830	your keyboard and like Roemer G's they
328259	have a center mounted RGB LED that
330599	enables brighter more even lighting
332969	effects with less spill and they actuate
337379	at one and a half millimeters of
339330	pressing down up to 25% faster than a
342330	Cherry MX
343289	but that's where the resemblance pretty
345120	much ends Romer G's have a very
347819	noticeable tactile bump while Q s ones
351449	are a linear switch but I still think
354509	saying that they're like shorter Cherry
357539	MX Reds doesn't really get the point
359759	across they have a strange resistance
362159	when you bottomed them out that feels
363919	kind of like pushing your hand down on a
367259	couch cushion like even even even oh
370080	yeah there's the you know there's the
372389	base of the couch like if you had really
375060	thick o rings on a cherry this makes
377699	them really quiet which is nice but also
380430	a little bit mushy feeling so between
383189	that and the lack of a tactile bump they
385649	are purely imo abominable for typing at
390270	least in this super flat configuration
392159	so I won't be switching from the next
394469	Browns anytime soon but that doesn't
396779	mean that they're bad there's zero dead
400080	zone between the actuation and reset
402300	which is good for gamers and from
404039	talking to Ezell whose skills are a
406379	little sharper than my own the apex M
408870	800 felt a little cramped in his words
411569	but it is so well tuned for FPS gaming
414689	that it would beat out the g9 10 and
416999	every Cherry keyboard out there as his
419699	csgo board of choice if they had taken
423810	it one step further and left off the
426509	number pad to leave room for more
428339	natural mousing posture and I guess
431189	that's the conclusion here unlike many
433499	other keyboards that were designed for
435509	gaming this one really did go all in
438779	gaming first typing second and it shows
442580	so well
443820	SteelSeries now let's see a 10 keyless
446340	and you've really got our attention not
448350	my in mind you I type on my keyboard but
450240	a detention for sure speaking of ugly
