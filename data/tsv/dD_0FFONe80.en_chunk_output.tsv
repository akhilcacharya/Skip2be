30	okay so today we're going to be unboxing
2009	a pretty cool new product from Logitech
4140	this is the logitech gaming keyboard
6859	g110 so this is a brand new product in
10769	their gaming keyboard line which started
13110	with the g15
14009	and the most recent edition was the g 19
16650	with a full-color LCD display up near
18900	the top but this one actually brings
21660	some pretty cool new features to the
23880	table so first of all you've got custom
26550	color backlighting so this particular G
28800	keyboard can do either blue red or a
32910	mixture of the two so you end up with
34739	kind of like a purple cool purple
36270	backlight okay it can also do
38700	programmable G keys just like all of the
41250	other G keyboards now you can see it's a
43200	bit of an improvement over the last
44370	generation value keyboard which was the
46950	G 11 actually no it's not really an
49230	improvement that way okay well you've
50460	got 12 G keys over on the left side here
53219	which is better than the g15 Gen 2 at
55320	any rate the one that I have on my desk
56969	which only has six okay and then the
59309	last thing and this is really neat
60719	unique to this model is the integrated
63059	USB audio so this keyboard actually has
66150	an integrated USB sound card that can
69810	process audio so you can just plug your
72000	mic and headset directly into the
74460	keyboard very cool you can have a look
76770	at the back it seems like they're
78570	basically covering the same basic
82439	features of this keyboard that we've
84420	already talked about here oh the last
86040	thing is that you've got a high speed
87630	USB 2.0 port so unlike a lot of the
91680	older G Series keyboards which used USB
94110	1.1 connectivity for their ports are for
97259	their hubs this one uses USB 2.0 okay so
101340	inside you will find the keyboard and I
104130	usually like to see the accessories
106049	first so why don't we have a quick look
108600	underneath wow that is pretty much it
111299	okay so we have a wrist rest alright
114600	which looks identical as far as I can
117119	tell to the remote it's a little bit
118560	different okay so we have a wrist rest
120360	they've lost kind of the rubberized feel
122579	to it and it's more of a plastic which
125090	you may or may not prefer that I think
127920	it's just more of a personal taste thing
129568	than anything
130110	else and let's get the keyboard itself
132450	out of here oh you've got a QuickStart
134850	guide okay then you have some important
137700	information clearly labeled it this is
139950	important okay so it's probably your
141360	warranty and ergonomics you know don't
143100	use it and and and hurt your wrist okay
145950	they've got they want you to tell us
147690	what you think of their product okay
150690	then you've got a driver CD download the
152700	latest drivers from Logitech calm that
154650	is the best way to go about things all
157860	right so if I can just figure out how
160050	this baggie works oh that's clever it
163709	has like a little slit in it for the
165980	okay let's attach the wrist rest here so
169410	you can see the wrist rest is actually
170970	quite large compared to the rest of the
172650	keyboard and compared to the previous
174120	gen ones it clips on in much the same
176250	way so you just clip it in from the
178260	bottom just like that yeah okay actually
182160	it's a little bit trickier to put in the
183870	other ones I hope it's more durable
184950	because I've managed to break a couple
186570	of these already okay so let's put this
189180	down on my desk I apologize for the
191100	state of my desk today we would have
192480	used the camera man's really but I
194390	didn't actually think of it and I
197010	already installed the drivers for the
198570	g110 on my computer so the cord is a
201360	reasonable length okay you're not going
203430	to be reaching a computer in a
205170	completely different room or anything
206640	like that but you're also not going to
208590	have any difficulty plugging it into the
210299	back of your PC okay let's go through
212910	the general layout of the keyboard
214230	itself here then so you've got your G
216090	keys on the side here and one M 2 and M
218790	3 are three different presets for your G
221010	keys so you can actually program in up
223860	to 12 times 3 so whatever that is 24 36
229590	different functionalities here depending
231480	which one of these is activated then
233430	you've got a fairly standard keyboard
235350	layout they've changed I think they're
238230	using the same key switches as the new G
240239	19 that I can't tell for sure to be
242250	perfectly honest it's not the same as
244049	the g15 Gen 2 though I can feel that
246299	much okay up here we have game mode
248340	versus windows mode so basically all
250320	that does is it deactivates your Windows
251910	key here we have headset off mic off or
255269	on presumably here we have a color
258988	change
259560	oh no this would be the brightness
260910	settings for your keyboard and then over
263580	here we have your multimedia buttons so
265349	play stop back forward mute and then a
268169	volume wheel so that is pretty cool and
271410	the the key feature here the cool one is
274110	the integrated USB audio port so this is
277200	your headphones this is your mic and
278640	then this is a USB 2.0 port which you
281010	can use for your mouse or for a thumb
283860	drive or whatever else it is now the
285599	cameraman is going to do some close-ups
287130	on the keyboard while I crawl over the
289050	desk and plug this thing in so that we
293010	can have a look at the backlighting and
294599	such okay there we go now I've
296940	pre-installed the drivers off the
298320	Logitech website and you can see it's
300539	actually cycling through the colors
301979	right now which is kind of cool it
303240	settled on purple if I give you enough
304770	shade here can you see them yeah you can
306419	see that that looks pretty neat so
308070	there's a few different rightness
309570	settings so there's off dim oh no it
312870	doesn't have that okay okay either way
316140	very cool and I guess that's pretty much
319229	it isn't isn't it thank you for checking
321539	out my unboxing of the g1 10 gaming
325020	keyboard
