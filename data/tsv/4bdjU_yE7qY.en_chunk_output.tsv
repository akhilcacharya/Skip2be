60	so today we're going to be doing a quick
1439	unboxing of the cyborg rat 5 so the rat
5430	5 is the middle range Mouse in the rat
9030	series of mice it is between the 3 and
11340	the 7 it has quite a few features that
14370	are improved over the rats 3 and I'd say
17760	it's probably the best value in this
20550	series of mice which are for hardcore
23820	gaming let's just get that out of the
25320	way there you go
26039	Gaming Mouse for PC so the rat 5 it has
28890	a 4000 dpi sensor which is about in the
31380	middle of the rat 3 and the rat 7 now
34230	bear in mind there's a rat 9 but it's
35880	basically a rat 7 with Wireless okay it
38640	has a few other things too it has a
40020	precision aim mode so that's a button
41640	that is for sniping okay it has a weight
44670	system which is better than the rat 3
47430	which does not have a weight system and
48780	it also has is adjustable so it has an
51270	adjustable length
52289	unlike the rat 3 so let's have a look at
54870	what it has to say for itself on the
56250	back it has more programmable buttons
58890	than the rat 3 as well with 15 user
61230	definable commands if I have 5 buttons
63120	in a three position load switch okay we
65880	have a precision a mode with on-the-fly
67770	sensitivity adjustment to study your aim
69570	at the touch of a button like I said for
71369	sniping and it has an aluminum chassis
73290	the rat 3 is also plastic so the
75810	aluminum chassis is well I guess it adds
77880	some durability as well as some rigidity
79770	to the mouse you can remap the
81450	programmable buttons and create custom
83159	macros with their powerful software and
85320	inside we find it also has a weight
88380	system so it has 30 grams of removable
90659	weights
91079	unlike the rat 3 which doesn't not have
93509	removable weighs custom links adjustment
96060	we covered that already and the four
97560	user definable dpi settings so you can
99509	adjust those dpi settings I believe in
101310	increments of 400 although I could be
106170	mistaken about that one please do
108390	correct me if I'm wrong Oh in 125 dpi
113009	steps yet another improvement over the
115500	rat 3 which is only adjustable in 400
118409	dpi steps okay we've got better
120540	acceleration we have better tracking
122130	speed and the polling rate is the same
124590	looks like we've got three different LED
126149	colors for each mode that you are in so
128940	that depends on
129788	what your programmable buttons will do
131909	and let's go ahead and get this open the
135129	packaging on the rat series is a bit of
138969	a challenge but I think I've got it
140620	figured out at this point this is my
142269	third rat unboxing oh should I just rip
145870	them to deny so much for having it
148810	figured out okay so that comes out of
150939	there this one comes out of here then we
154510	are and this one will then finally and I
160329	dropped my camera sorry I probably gives
162459	you guys a headache when it swings
163900	around like that I'm using the born
167230	series of movies approach to filming my
169480	unboxings from now on this extensive use
172090	of shakey cam to make it seem more
173650	exciting okay forget it we're just going
176349	to do this
177359	okay inside here we find a little cyborg
182379	gaming thing which is gonna have a
183939	driver CD a little product guide to
187989	cyborgs a gaming line of products okay
191620	we also have a little yeah here we go
193480	here's my product guide oh no this is
196120	just for this mouse okay so this shows
197769	you a bunch of really cool stuff then so
199810	[Music]
203430	what if I can figure out how to make
205750	this right side up then will be in
207190	really good shape seems to be numbered
211569	well I can't okay here we go
214150	so one insert the CCD to plug in the USB
217540	connector three installed the cyborg
221260	technology software setting their
224319	precision aim button for four so what
226479	your sensitivity will be when you turn
228129	on precision aim alright step 5 is
232290	changing your adjustable dpi step six is
235389	the mode button set up to three
236919	different sets of button assignments and
238359	sensitivity levels by s T software so
240370	depending which games you like what
242229	sensitivity and whatever else you want
244419	to adjust here we've got the adjustable
246129	length including
247269	instructions for how to do that which
248979	will come in handy in a moment here we
250720	have our weight storage system which is
255090	from the oh yeah ok from the bottom in
257470	the back so we'll figure that out - and
258760	then for dpi settings which are just
261010	pull with this button so let's go ahead
262840	and get them
263550	oh wait hold on there's one of this
264660	thing here what's this oh yeah okay
267150	here's the little guide to the rest of
268530	the rats and the rest of the cyber
271080	gaming series of products all right here
274379	is our adjustable weight guy that has 50
277740	grams removable weights inside here is
282659	our rat five with a couple of twists
287220	tides holding it into place in the
288810	packaging here so I'll just go ahead and
290310	pull those out challenging so there it
295349	is there's the aluminum chassis that I
296849	remember from the rat 7 and I did notice
299699	was missing on the rat 3 okay so here
303599	first things first why don't we have a
304949	look at the adjustable weights believe
309240	that's this one there we are
314699	so we can put on as many weights as we
316409	want okay and then we can close it up
319979	again just like that so that's pretty
323520	straightforward it's something you won't
324690	use often because once you've got it
327090	tuned the way you like it you probably
328530	won't want to change it very often but
331169	it's really nice to have that feature
333300	because I personally do change the
336419	weight settings on any mice where I have
338039	that option I like a heavy Mouse and
339659	most mice these days seem to be tuned
342810	for pretty light weight build so it's
347969	it's nice to have a little bit of extra
349710	heft to it although the rat 5 is not a
351569	light Mouse because of the aluminum
352919	chassis it has on it it does have a
354960	little bit more weight than an all
356520	plastic Mouse normally would so let's
359940	have a look at the buttons we have
360960	included there's your precision aim
362310	button so that's going to change your
363599	DPI on the fly there's your indicator
367199	LEDs for the DPI I believe hope it's not
374240	there is your dpi change button here is
378419	your mode change button you've got your
381240	left click your right click as well as
383880	your middle click mouse wheel ok and
387029	then this one right here let's figure
389340	out what that does why don't we I think
391169	that's to do with this but give me a
393360	second
393990	so the adjustable length
396650	gently squeeze the retaining clip then
398780	slide the mouth shell backward or for no
403010	no there it is so that's all you got to
404240	do you just got to squeeze this little
405530	cliff and slide it back and forward just
408470	like that okay so what you know I think
411020	I remember figuring this out on the rat
413360	7 video why don't we figure out what
415370	that does and then I'll come back in
416720	just a moment well that was a lot
418880	simpler than I thought it's just a
420170	programmable scroll button for your
421790	thumb so you can actually access these
423920	buttons here the aim button and you can
425720	also scroll it left or right and you can
428300	completely program what that guy does so
430940	I mean I guess if I was using this mouse
432920	one of the things I'd consider
434060	programming it for is just fire because
437000	it'd be a really quick way to fire off
438950	like a boat with you for about 6 or 7
441470	rounds in a burst just like that so
443780	that's kind of a neat functionality so
445940	thank you for checking out my unboxing
446960	of the rat 5 don't forget to subscribe
