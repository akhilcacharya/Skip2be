240	today we're going to be doing an
1650	unboxing of the SteelSeries shift gaming
4680	keyboard so this is the replacement
7830	product for the Z board or Zed board and
11610	no matter what way I say it somebody's
13590	going to complain so I don't care so
16650	this is the shift the Z board is gone
19080	this is a SteelSeries branded product
21779	the Z board was a kind of a legacy
23460	product left over from the ideas on
25670	acquisition so it was originally the
27630	ideas on time okay I'm not going to talk
29310	about the Seaboard anymore we're going
30840	to talk about the shift so just like the
33000	Z board the shift has replaceable key
36000	sets removable replaceable re anything
39239	of all key sets that means you can put
40920	in custom ones for a particular game
42989	that you like you can put in the stock
45239	one if you don't have a particular game
47039	that you like although there's a lot of
48300	gaming functions on the stock one let's
50460	just get this unboxed and talk about all
52770	the different features and get all the
55949	different features more than anything
57000	else so this is the SteelSeries sticker
58800	that is included very irrelevant next we
61530	have a professional gaming gear catalog
63359	where they actually show here's one of
64860	the custom key sets or two of them
66630	rather for the shift so there's a world
69750	of warcraft one there's a Starcraft 2
71580	one there are a variety of other games a
73619	lot of animals that SteelSeries does
75840	have custom key sets for it
77850	Hey look at this no CD download the
81119	latest drivers SteelSeries says so -
82890	because they are serious about gaming
84960	and so am i when you're serious gamer
87150	you're never using drivers off the disk
88829	you are always downloading your own so
91530	that's in a variety of languages
92670	SteelSeries is a worldwide company and
94680	they do sell into a number large number
98549	rather of different markets so here
102060	under a little flap at the top we're
104700	going to find a little wrist rest which
108750	say I can remove the tape from and we'll
111240	show you that as well and then once I've
113460	got the product completely removed from
115409	the Box I'm just going to close the box
116939	back up then we'll have a look at what
119460	SteelSeries has to say for themselves on
121740	the back of the product here now the
123509	thing that stood out to me about the
125759	shift more than anything
127180	the first time I saw which was quite a
129190	while ago actually I mind you that was
132280	that was a prototype so the finished
135040	product may be slightly different what
137350	is the fact that the build quality of it
139540	the overall fit and finish of the shift
141490	is just worlds ahead worlds ahead of the
145810	old Zboard so here I'm actually going to
149080	stand over here don't don't shift your
150460	angle oh we're going to look at the
151780	we're going to look at the shift here so
153820	we can install the wrist rest just like
156580	that quite easily all right you can see
159340	the bottom of its got like this weird
160780	like texture thing going on that's kind
162730	of neat then you've got oh look at that
165160	so you can either tilt it a little bit
166780	or a lot or not at all
169480	you've got three different settings for
171280	the rubberized feet there that's a
173140	pretty neat little feature so we're
174970	going to not tilt it at all for the sake
176530	of this video okay and let's see what
178780	SteelSeries has to say so first of all
181630	one they have there are eight
184540	programmable hotkeys so those are up
186820	here on the top there's your eight
188140	programmable hotkeys and then number two
191020	we have on-the-fly macro recording so
193300	that is located right about here so you
196540	can just press record macro and you can
199390	record a macro next we have multiple
201970	media controls so you can see the media
204430	control keys are right over here on the
207550	left look at the keyboard not the blocks
208870	actually here I'll I'll point out where
210430	they are sorry about that okay so we've
212290	got mute volume up volume down play
214570	forward as well as backwards next we
217239	have gold plated audio and audio headset
220360	jacks so that is on the quite long cord
223780	actually that's included on the shift
225340	here's all of our plugs so one of these
227560	USB s is for the keyboard itself the
230320	others for the integrated hub and the
232450	other two are for audio so if you do
234430	have a SteelSeries headset you can
236650	actually shorten the cable on most of
238720	them and then you can plug it directly
240310	into the back of your keyboard so this
243400	is where all of that comes out so
244900	there's your USB hub there's your
246580	microphone and there is your headphone
248590	port so that's a pretty neat little
250390	feature because it really reduces the
251980	amount of random cable mess around your
254680	computer desk next we have yet to USB
257139	2.0 ports one powered
259130	ergonomic design with three yet we
260570	already showed the other three leg
262100	levels and then the detachable wrist
264140	rest which we already showed now I'm not
266480	going to be able to obviously use it for
268430	an extended period of time here and tell
270080	you guys my impressions but I can at
271580	least tell you how comfortable it feels
273530	right off the bat so if I was sitting at
276560	sort of a reasonable typing level
278180	actually that's that's fairly nice now
280940	one of the things that is going to be a
282530	little bit different for people is the
286040	split in the keyboard so you can see
288140	there's actually a hinge that goes right
290330	through the spacebar alright and then
292760	there is another split right between the
295700	keyboard and where the number pad and
298130	the other Keys including your arrow keys
300800	are so the reason for that is over on
303710	this side we have a little latch and we
306470	can lift the whole thing up just like
308300	that so that is how easy it is to remove
313340	the key set so here's the entire shift
315770	keyboard with just the key switches
318440	installed and nothing else and when you
321770	want to put on a new key set you go
323600	ahead and you can either by the shift in
325700	a bundle sometimes with an appropriate
328040	key set or you can buy the key sets on
330080	their own so all you need to do is go
331880	okay well you know gonna play some
333650	Starcraft 2 for my Starcraft 2 key set
336260	on there just like that and clip it on
340130	that simple pretty neat okay let's look
343760	at what else we have here in terms of
345290	features I'm going to cheat I'm going to
346730	look at the box and see if there's
348050	anything that I've missed and I don't
351860	believe that there is so there's a lot
353270	of there's a lot of key sets as I
355610	mentioned before for some MMO some RTS
357860	some FPS games mostly it's going to be
360770	your more popular games you know Age of
363080	Empires Warcraft those kinds of triple-a
365630	sorts of titles but yeah the thing that
368330	really stands out to me most about the
370160	shift compared to the old Zboard oh yeah
372470	here's another good one you can actually
374180	use your old Zboard key sets with the
377330	new shift so like I said the overall
379970	build quality the feel of the keys
382100	themselves
382940	switches that are underneath is much
384740	much better on the shift it's just got
387170	an overall more robust feel to it
389960	and if you just want a new shift and you
392780	want to use your old key set it's as
394040	simple as just buying a shift taking
396200	this off and throwing your old key set
398840	on it just like that so thank you for
