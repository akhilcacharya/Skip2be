30	welcome to my unboxing of the logitech
3210	t6 50 wireless rechargeable touchpad in
6420	space so what's going to happen to the
9269	box as we remove it from the touchpad
12030	itself is it's just going to fall away
14370	and get pulled down by the Earth's
16109	gravitational field so you'll never see
18240	it again
18660	which means we better carefully go
20609	through everything it says on the box
22199	before that happens
23880	click wherever your fingers rest on the
26250	touch surface yep that's what a touchpad
27750	does glide through Windows 8 with a wide
29910	range of gestures 13 gestures including
32759	vertical and horizontal slow scrolling
34739	click Windows 8 Start screen with three
36870	fingers up windows 8 edge gesture so you
39300	can pull in from the edges and you can
41309	pinch to zoom in and out it has a large
43620	glass touch service which delivers
45270	premium smoothness and precision
48300	I do like glass touch pads actually I
50579	encountered one not that long ago on a I
54090	believe it was an HP EliteBook feels so
57449	much better than a plastic touch pad
59609	surface just because of the the
61440	smoothness of the sliding is much like
63750	much like a smart phone except touch
65640	phone touch pads because we don't have
67470	to have a display behind them often have
69659	a textured surface to them so it's even
72540	better than sort of scrolling and
74460	gesturing on a touch oh right right
76320	right sorry yeah went away it felt don't
80610	worry about it ok so the first thing we
82350	find inside the box is the touch pad
83850	itself that is a big old touch pad it's
85979	about the size of a CD slim jewel case
88920	actually very very cool so let's hold on
91290	see what else we have inside here we're
93090	going to find apparently according to
94409	this picture
95009	one of logitech's unifying receivers
97409	there it is as well as an extension cord
100020	for that piece so this guy right here
102600	can connect up to 6 Logitech devices
105119	which just is one little dongle so you
106560	could have a logitech wireless keyboard
108119	wireless mouse wireless touchpad
109640	Wireless you know augmented reality
112799	goggles I don't think they have that yet
114479	but who knows maybe it's coming there's
116009	your set-up guide which is probably
117540	about as simple as plug the thing into
119880	the thing and then don't worry about the
121829	other thing this is a charging cable so
124110	that's where our rather wireless
126420	wireless a 2 wireless mini Beano on USB
129360	a 2 USB micro-b so there you get a
131940	little micro connector oh yeah
135180	jokes not old yet right
137010	and the touchpad itself it has quite a
139439	solid feel to it you can see here it's
142200	wrapped in plastic it has little
145170	instructions built into it Logitech
146819	doesn't trust you to read that
147930	QuickStart guide they include the
149250	instructions right here just in case and
151019	they were right to do that they also
152640	recommend right there download the
155099	latest drivers off the website I
156720	actually did not see a driver disk
159180	although it probably doesn't even really
160920	need drivers because it probably just
162480	works anyway because if you're using it
165209	with Windows 8 all these gestures are
167310	natively supported so the surface like I
170220	said before made of glass not as
171930	textured as I had actually expected
173790	there's only a slight ever-so-slight
176400	actually I'd say it's pretty much smooth
178019	it's not quite as smooth as something
179700	like a smartphone but it's pretty much a
181920	smooth window the back here has the
184769	micro USB charging port here's your
188730	power on and off switch here is a blank
192599	thing and here is another more different
194129	lengthing you can see there's a slight
195269	angle to it so you're not it's not going
197310	to be quite flat on the table it'll be
199260	tilted up just a little bit there's an
201750	activity LED here that popped up there
204150	for a second but then apparently went
206489	away so we're going to see if we can get
208199	that - there we go
209579	so that's the I guess that's a power
211440	indicator so we've turned it on now and
213449	other than that there's not much to say
215250	so let's hook this bad boy up
221010	so slicks Windows 8 notebook now has a
223230	unifying reciever and he's in the
224909	bathroom right now so we we got the
228650	touchpad installed and hold on let me to
231360	see if this is important it's the crazy
233400	Russian apparently so let's just find
235709	out what he wants hey Russian what no no
242010	it's okay
243260	I'm filming I gotta go okay bye okay
248430	don't worry about it
249329	okay so check this out check this out so
251030	we're going to troll slick because now
254310	that this is installed I think you won't
255989	probably won't even notice this when it
257279	comes back we can swipe in and get the
260130	charms menu we can go 3 up 4 star we can
263789	zoom whoops there we go pinch to zoom we
267090	can scroll back and forth just two
270360	fingers like that so there's lots of
271740	cool gestures that we can do you can
273210	also just use it as a trackpad and oh
275280	he's coming back so hold on I'm just
276780	going to stand right here got my lapel
284850	mic on so you guys multa you won't hear
287070	what I'm saying but I'm just looking
288570	casual over here so for that transmen
