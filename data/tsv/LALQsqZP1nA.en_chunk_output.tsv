30	we have had all sorts of bizarro
3389	keyboards through the lab lately from
5250	super economic to super ergo no thank
8639	you but the one thing that all of them
10950	have in common is they're just not that
15599	cool to be fair the Kinesis freestyle
18869	edge isn't uncool it just lacks the wow
22380	factor of the more flashy mainstream
25019	keyboard options that are out there so
27599	then introducing the latest iteration of
31050	the infamous Peugeot Doc's
32700	easy keyboard a no compromises
35760	ergonomic keyboard that actually looks
38160	as good as it feels and for the first
42030	time ever now comes with user
44040	replaceable key switches today's video
48210	is brought to you by ZOTAC ZOTAC ZBOX
51510	pcs are compact and they have different
53940	variants that are great for applications
56309	like streaming and gaming check them out
58710	at the link below
60810	[Music]
68730	looking at it beer godox easy is kind of
71530	like a mashup of two boards from rival
74470	Orgel board maker Kinesis it's a split
77410	keyboard like the freestyle edge but it
80230	has thumb clusters and ortho linear keys
83290	like the advantage - it's a small 76
87310	keyboard which lands it somewhere
89050	between a 60% and a 10 keyless so
91780	there's no function row but it does have
95020	navigation keys wherever you decide to
97720	put them now since ergo dock started out
100330	as an open-source build your own board
102520	company customizability is in the easies
105100	DNA they include F and J key caps that
108910	don't have tactile guides in case you
110920	plan on rearranging the letters in a
112660	Dvorak or colemak configuration and even
116260	if you order your board with a legend on
118600	the key caps which you're not even
120520	required to do some keys are still left
123610	on mark so as to not be confusing
125920	after you customize your layout and
128669	customize you will because the default
131800	layout is pretty different for example
136150	the backspace is now more easily
138310	accessible over here beside the a key
141010	while the apostrophe is way down here
144400	under the Z that is too far for me I'm
147970	very possessive of my apostrophe key now
151870	for his part James our writer actually
154270	went through nine iterations before
157030	landing on the perfect layout that
160060	sounds like a lot of work but that high
162550	number actually just goes to show how
164620	easy it is to tweak the configuration
167200	just use the online configurator tool
169750	and flash the firmware to save it right
172120	on to the board and while you're at it
174280	you don't have a ton of keys on this
176709	thing so you'll probably want to take
178420	advantage of at least a couple of the 32
181860	available layers which you can switch
184840	between in some pretty cool ways like
187420	switching only as long as you hold a
189700	particular key down or switching layers
193000	but only for a single key press kind of
195880	like how shift works on your phone all
198220	this customization does mean that
200849	yes this board can take some time to get
204749	used to especially if you're not used to
207299	ortho linear or non staggered keys which
210450	I guess then brings us into economics
212280	the split board lets you tilt each key
215340	module to keep your wrists from bending
217170	outward so that's good but if you want
219750	to cut out wrist extension you'll need
221909	the nice and solid but sold separately
224849	silicon fuzz collect I'm sorry excuse me
227489	our wrist rests and same goes for
230340	battling pronation you'll actually need
232439	the ted kit for another 30 bucks extra
235590	it's not cheap but the legs are metal
239310	making them nice and durable the cute
241469	little dipped feet are available in
242969	white or black to match the color of
244949	your board once it's installed you can
247019	tilt each individual leg through
248909	ratcheted steps or using the included
251400	washers step lessly it takes longer to
254819	set up than Kinesis is also sold
257130	separately lift kit but the end result
259560	is more versatile and feels more quality
263310	in fact overall build quality has a lot
266250	to do with the easies cool factor it
268620	doesn't look like it was made in the 90s
271110	like many other organ ama keyboards and
273449	that beauty is more than skin deep the
276150	key caps for example are made by
277740	signature plastics the printed set is
280289	double shot injected ABS plastic with a
282599	lower profile than most key caps and a
285690	rough and surface finish on the top so
287970	they don't get that gross shiny look as
290070	they wear out and the unprinted set is
292590	PBT with a special bonus as well since
296099	there's no reason to move them around
297389	their sculpted meaning that each row has
300150	a differently shaped key cap for
302130	improved ergonomics then underneath the
305219	key caps it gets real because you'll
307860	find one of 12 different switch types
310949	available right out of the box wait I'm
314190	sorry did I say one of Believe It or Not
316710	our board right here actually has five
319469	difference which types plugged into it
321659	right now
322800	the easy makes swapping them out well
325680	easy just use the included dual polish
328830	tool to swap out some Cherry MX browns
331139	for Red's on the WASD keys
334030	maybe some blacks on the keys you don't
336040	want to strike accidentally like cue and
337930	overwatch maybe some super crunchy kale
342250	thick gold for the number keys I mean
344620	the hell yeah why not let's throw let's
347350	throw some cherry MX whites in here for
349570	I don't know these keys in the future
353170	you'll even be able to order small
354820	numbers of extra switches directly from
356650	ergo docks but for now their ordering
358990	system only allows you to buy a complete
360910	set which I guess brings us nicely to
363580	our gripes it wasn't easy to docks these
367570	marks
368790	but I have to talk about the cable I
371910	appreciate that these are detachable and
374350	therefore replaceable in theory but they
376720	stand out as the least premium aspect of
379120	the entire package not only are they not
380950	braided they've got like printing on
383740	them like they just went to a store and
385330	bought them next up is the lighting be
387940	underglow pretty freakin sweet it does
390669	contribute to the coolness factor
392130	there's lots of options for colors
394270	patterns and brightness but is this as
397870	good as backlit keys maybe that's a
401050	matter of opinion but I do hope to see
402760	that on a future version of the board as
405370	for the bottom line whether to buy that
408700	depends on what you're willing to spend
410310	just the board by itself without even
413560	switches is 225 US dollars a basic
417550	configuration then is 270 and if you add
420190	all the bells and whistles which to
422380	achieve proper ergonomic status we'd
425380	recommend you're sitting at three
427300	hundred and fifty five dollars as for
429640	any bonus key switches you want to throw
431530	in well that's gonna cost you - so is it
434770	a lot for a mechanical keyboard yes is
437890	it a lot for a programmable mechanical
440290	keyboard
440890	yep is it a lot for a programmable
443919	mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting it
446350	sure is but is it a lot for an ergonomic
450100	keyboard actually no so if you're
453880	looking for a board that's as functional
455680	as it is eye-catching then the erga
457300	docks easy might be worth making the
459250	switch speaking of making the switch if
463870	you're hosting your website on a less
