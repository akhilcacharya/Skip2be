30	they're now rockin RGB LEDs a new 16000
3629	dpi sensor and a few new features was it
7589	worth bringing back a 10 year old design
9480	is the Mamba a wireless gaming mouse
11910	worth considering FreshBooks is the
24060	super simple invoicing solution that
26130	lets you get organized save time and get
28769	paid faster click now to try it free
31940	normally I don't care about Mouse
34020	packaging because they're usually not
35880	worth caring about the diamondback was
38489	no different the Mamba on the other hand
41280	came in a black metal box with no hint
43440	of what was inside except for a small
45210	embossed Razer logo first I tore open
48930	the diamondback box and plugged in the
50910	mouse as I got that the mouse wheel
52739	Razer logo and strip around the edge of
54960	a mouse all moving around in a wave of
57239	rainbow I thought this was going to be
60090	my go-to mouse for csgo for the
62250	foreseeable future
63449	the final Mouse is my daily driver and
65760	with it I've risen through the ranks of
67710	legendary eagle to global elite - check
70320	out my review click here however despite
72840	its pinpoint accuracy the feel and build
74939	quality pale in comparison to the
76950	Diamondback the textured rubber grips on
79229	both sides the slightly textured plastic
81659	of the body left and right clicks and
84030	the bumpy rubberized mouse wheel with
86400	solid steps but the honeymoon period
89040	didn't last long I find the narrow
90869	middle section where the grips are
92640	situated too narrow there's no place
95579	that comfortably put my thumb and pinky
97619	as a mouse that can stay planted on the
99840	desk it's fine in an RTS MOBA or
102420	high-sensitivity shooter a soft grip is
104939	not that bad but seeing as how I have to
107640	lift almost constantly in csgo and I
110040	have a tight grip on it I can't get
112530	comfortable or accurate and I decided to
114810	move on before my wrists and fingers
116219	hurt even more in the all-black metal
119100	container the shape foam cutouts held
121229	the Mamba its dock the detachable cable
123840	and clicked tension adjustment tool with
126000	bigger grip pads on the sides a hump
127829	that was further forward and big rounded
129628	thumb buttons it fits right in my hand
131730	even though it was well
133350	of my weight preference of about nothing
135510	grams it was comfortable out-of-the-box
138690	the clicks feel far too light this is
141660	actually a common complaint against the
143340	Death Adder
143880	but this time around Razer provided a
146070	novel solution on the underside of the
149010	Mamba you'll find two adjustment notches
150840	to increase or decrease the click force
153270	and it works perfectly
155070	just like the Diamondback the Mamba felt
157380	and looked premium the ability to tilt
159870	the mouse wheel left and right is also a
161850	nice addition all the clicks for a
163770	satisfactory and the lighting effects
165420	are just so pretty in game I thought the
169050	performance was more than fine I wasn't
171210	aiming as fast as I could with my
172620	lighter final mouse but I wasn't doing
174630	too bad there were some moments that
176850	felt a little bit off though and my
178680	tests outside the game confirmed it for
180960	both the Diamondback and Mamba which
183390	only makes sense as they use the same
186210	sensor so this is where it starts
189360	looking iffy the sensor initially seemed
192060	fine but the dreaded z-axis issue that's
194940	plagued the Philips 20 cents er since
197010	like forever is still there when you
200430	lift the mouse the sensor translates it
202860	as movement down and to the right no
205080	matter what the actual physical movement
207300	was at high sensitivity you can move
209820	your cursor to the corner of the screen
212280	just by tilting the mouse up and down
214950	for a game like dota that's not too big
217560	of a deal but for a high-precision game
220140	like csgo that's game ending not as big
223980	of a game ender but still a big deal the
226530	Mamba sensor readouts in wireless mode
228360	seem to gets body when you use advanced
230610	custom lighting effects you can stick to
233520	basic ones but you shouldn't have to
236030	strangely enough though playing in csgo
238290	didn't seem to be affected by that issue
240180	as much as I thought at higher dpi so I
242460	think it might just exaggerate it so
244830	your mileage may vary overall I feel
247890	like both the Diamondback and Mamba
249870	suffered from the DPI race and change
251910	for the sake of change the original
253950	Diamondback had a rubber ring around it
256560	and that's what you would hold on to
258120	this one just hurts your hand so while I
261180	love the chroma effects the build
263880	quality is great and the click force
266370	adjustment
266940	the Mamba is really neat I don't see why
269730	they went with a flawed 16000 dpi laser
272370	sensor instead of their tried-and-true
274470	s3 9 8 8 or 8 9 and I don't know who the
279540	Diamondback is for everyone I've asked
282090	has found it really uncomfortable if the
284700	mom that had the same sensor as the
286020	Death Adder I think it could outright
288360	replace it even for competitive games
290700	running in Wireless mode and I guess
292980	that's where we are they could have been
295050	perfect but they're not just a couple of
297690	bad decisions ruined them for me and at
300030	the price they're asking you can get
302550	more real performance from somewhere
304920	else
