30	welcome to another unboxing this is the
2340	Roccat Kone pure a gaming mouse for the
6210	gamers who want all of the gaming
8099	features imma let that sink in for a
11460	moment so in terms of features what do
13769	we got
14219	Pro aim laser sensor r3 so it's an 8200
17490	dpi sensor that they're claiming is good
19500	for up to 1200 fps okay so it should be
25710	very smooth movement button duplicator
27449	easy shift + will show you this on the
29160	mouse itself so what that basically
31230	allows you to do is set up a shift
34020	button that enables different
36090	functionality of the other buttons so
37920	instead of going ok function 1 2 3 4 5 6
44040	7 you can go okay shift 1 and then that
48329	could be function 8 for example so you
50820	can have you can have a shift button
52199	that allows you to enable more
53309	functionality this is great for MMO
54750	players maybe less of a factor for FPS
57090	players customizable lighting multicolor
59219	so 16 point whatever million colors on
61559	the Rockette logo at the back rocket
63270	rocket I keep saying it wrong TDC U is
66299	interesting so this is a tracking
67770	technology that is designed to help you
70229	control how much your lift distance
72840	affects the sensitivity of the mouse
75090	itself so so you can configure how much
77310	lift distance you want to have before it
79530	stops sensing and allows you to not sort
82470	of move all over the place
83640	when you lift the mouse up when you get
84960	to the edge of your mouse pad one other
86700	solution to that problem is to get a
88170	bigger mouse pad and that's usually what
89850	I recommend especially if you're a low
91320	sensitivity gamer it's nice to have a
92759	nice big pad but it's nice to know that
95159	if you lift it's not going to go all
96390	over the place so it's got light system
98400	drivers and macros ah rocket talk so
101400	rocket talk is a good one
102810	what rocket talk does is it actually
105630	allows you with multiple rocket devices
107850	that support rocket talk rocket talk
109979	they are able to communicate with each
112439	other to enable sort of certain certain
115560	bonuses so whether it's things like
117509	ambient lighting effects or feedback
121079	based on you know you got some like
122850	poison thing going on and the color of
124680	your mouse can actually change to green
126329	when there's a poison effect I mean not
128068	everyone looks at their mouth while
129300	they're gaming but it's just one of
130440	those things is kind of cool especially
131640	if you're at a LAN you know you
133830	you're low on mana and all your
135150	peripherals starting to grow glow blue
137070	and kind of cool things like that
138360	they've also got what they call I
140460	totally have a cheat sheet for this you
141690	guys because I just kind of gave up on
143400	remembering everything talk FX which is
145740	audio feedback which will actually allow
147450	you to go okay I'm going to change my
149220	profile but maybe I'm not staring at my
151800	mouse so maybe like we've seen mice that
153720	have color changing effects when you
155490	change profiles but maybe I'm not
156960	looking at it say that same thing where
158640	maybe I'm not looking at it when the man
159720	is low because I'm concerned with
161010	replenishing my mana what it'll do is
163620	it'll actually tell you through your
165060	speakers the new dpi setting that you've
167220	changed you can configure what kinds of
168780	things that will tell you so for example
170250	it can even say things like volume up
172170	they've got a demo on their website
173490	that's actually pretty neat so so that's
175860	cool 32-bit turbo core ARM processor so
178950	it's got a fast chip in it 576 kilobytes
181740	of onboard memory allows you to store
183120	tons of macros and settings and it's got
185550	seven mouse buttons which we showed you
186870	before high build quality using Omron
189030	switches so let's actually show you the
191400	mouse itself so it's a bit on the
192780	smaller side it's not a huge Mouse by
194550	any stretch of the imagination it is
196260	ergonomically shaped so you can see it's
198209	designed for right-handed people shorter
201000	index finger longer middle finger just a
203730	2 2 D mouse button so there's no left
206220	and right shift just a click and then up
208830	and down you've got back and forward
210959	buttons here on the left I think these
212340	are a must for any Mouse these days if
214470	you don't have back and forward then
215790	it's sort of brutal and then these guys
218340	right here for profile switching or
220080	honestly whatever else you would like so
222360	then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 those are your
225269	buttons this is the lighting zone right
226830	here and on the bottom you find your
229200	8200 dpi sensor along with some Teflon
232380	pads along the top and the bottom of the
234690	mouse these are big enough that you're
236160	not going to have any issues with them I
237810	hated some of the old mice they used to
239970	have little tiny pads like in the
241530	corners and it made them wear out a lot
243360	faster was very 9 they'd come off too
245370	because there's not enough adhesive on
246870	them so that was just ridiculous so in
249209	terms of ergonomics I'd say this is
250739	about perfect for my hands even a touch
253950	on the small side if I was going to Palm
255810	it out right because you can see that if
257548	I put my palm here my fingers are going
259560	to go right to the end of the mouse
261149	itself so it's more of a claw grip Mouse
263520	and I mean you know what here I'm going
265530	to take the camera from slick for a
266970	second here I'm going
267690	let him put his hand on it just to give
269580	you some idea so that's with sort of a
271200	baseball glove baseball mitt sized hand
274260	Nowak sorry do it again I didn't get you
276480	before baseball mitt sized hand so you
279030	can see it's a little bit on the small
280320	side for him so I'd say this one is
282420	would be great for girls guys with
284610	smaller hands but not necessarily
286290	optimized for extremely large hands and
288390	I'm totally going to go back to my cheat
290130	sheet make sure I didn't miss anything
291570	and I think we are good so don't forget
297120	to subscribe
297690	oh yeah the rocket achievements so
299760	there's actually an application built
301500	into the driver that will track your
303570	usage now this can be useful because
305550	it'll tell you things like which buttons
308100	are being over utilized or underutilized
310190	so that you can optimize better for you
313230	know your gameplay which ones you find
314580	easiest to reach maybe you have a hard
316110	to reach button and you're using that
317700	one all the time and an easy to reach
318960	button that you're not using all the
320100	time so you can track stats like that
321660	and it also gives you little
322890	achievements like I think diesel one
324780	called scroll master sultan of scroll
330420	that's what it was called so that's
331530	pretty funny don't forget to subscribe
