0	this video is brought to you by the
1709	Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
5069	add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
7830	Haswell system for unbelievable overall
9960	performance welcome to a very special
11700	outdoor unboxing I basically dragged a
14429	dining room table out into the yard with
16740	me and we are going to be checking out
18420	the tte Sports by Thermaltake nook ernow
21600	I originally thought that said knuckler
23310	and so my initial impression was really
26010	a keyboard that you operate like this no
31230	probably not actually
32250	so the Nook er is a plunger gaming
34920	keyboard which got me pretty excited
36329	about it and the reason for that is that
38309	plunger switches are a type of keyboard
40920	switch that I have never encountered
43140	before so they are a sort of like
46200	they're a membrane switch okay so to be
47940	clear these are not a mechanical switch
49739	but they have been engineered and
52260	integrated into this keyboard by the
54059	Thermaltake team in an effort to
56219	simulate the tactile experience of a
59879	mechanical switch with a membrane switch
62579	that is obviously coming in at a lower
65430	price point than what you would pay for
67500	a mechanical keyboard such as the mecha
69810	g1 which is also a thermaltake keyboard
72659	so in terms of included accessories
74369	we've got some replacement key caps so
78270	they give you WASD key caps as well as
81420	your arrow keys that you can replace on
83729	the keyboard as well as a key cap puller
85729	alright come in a little baggy like that
88200	we've also got the keyboard itself as
90180	well as a thermal take TT esports battle
93509	dragon sticker and then the manual which
95700	hopefully you don't need for a keyboard
97259	because I'm going to tell you everything
98880	you need to know about the nutter in
100740	this particular video it has a couple of
103439	unique features okay so there's the
104850	plunger switches which are kind of like
107460	what they're saying and I haven't tried
108869	them yet I haven't touched this keyboard
110670	yet what they're saying is that it's a
113310	lighter mechanical switch feeling at a
116329	lower cost it's only 15 million key
119700	presses for the total sort of rated
122729	endurance compared to 50 million for a
124770	Cherry MX which but they should be a
127710	lighter and therefore more comfortable
129568	for some people now there's a couple
130889	other unique things check out these S
132540	buttons here
133590	those actually changed the repeat rate
136200	of the keys so you can go anywhere from
138810	1 X - 8 X by holding function s1 s2 s3
141780	s4 this looks like a feature that was
144360	actually built specifically for one of
146160	their sponsored gamers which is very
147720	cool because a lot of companies talk
149760	about how they work with sponsored
151560	gamers to design their peripherals but a
153840	lot of the time it really feels like the
155250	company designed the peripheral and then
157290	went and searched for gamers to put
158910	their stamp on it not going to name any
161610	names of course so I'm a plunger switch
164970	offers response feeling like a
166769	mechanical switch enhanced anti-ghosting
169019	function look for up to 12 keys with USB
170970	and 16 keys with ps2 oh yeah and that
173190	repeat rate changer only works with ps2
176420	plunger switch enables excellent gaming
178620	USD with life expectancy up to 15
180690	million keystrokes so let's look at this
182069	they also say they're quieter than
183360	mechanical switches they sound about
187019	like blacks to me so in terms of the
188940	audible level here I want you guys to
190319	I'll get my mic in nice and close ok so
198030	they sound about like a cherry MX black
200190	which is a very very quiet mechanical
202109	key switch by comparison sort of
204780	compared to other ones maybe even closer
206370	to Reds the other sort of a unique
208470	feature is function f12 illuminates the
210959	battle dragon down here and other than
212970	that it's a fairly standard keyboard
214530	layout this right here is a cardinal sin
216359	though for me long shift Keys long enter
219660	keys and long backspace keys are a
221340	requirement for for forgetting sort of
224489	the line of seal of approval because I
226319	have small hands and here if you
229170	actually we're going to switch places I
231000	think this is known as crossing the axis
232560	am I am I right barrel so what happens
235859	for me is when I'm on the home row here
237510	if I reach here I can you can already
240299	tell from the limited flexibility in my
241920	hands I can barely reach this let alone
244220	this like my hand will move from the
246810	home row see that that L I'm not able to
250079	keep my finger on there so that's that's
252030	a problem for me but it might not be a
254459	problem for you especially if you have
255690	larger hands than I do and let's get
258750	impressions of the sort of the back of
260728	the keyboard you got your little razors
262440	here this is good I love it when
263610	manufacturers include this where you've
265380	got a little rubber piece here
267270	along with the rubber piece here so it
268889	actually doesn't slide even when you
270419	elevate it a little bit the wrist rest
272729	is non-removable on this keyboard and
274620	that's probably at least partly due to
276300	the fact that this is illuminated and
278120	let's get some impressions of the actual
280650	keys here so they do feel like they have
286199	a tactile bump they definitely do
288539	are they mechanical key switches are the
290490	replacement for chemical mechanical key
292110	switches see you've probably never seen
293250	anything quite like this before no they
297180	were bound very quickly though which is
298590	nice a feature of membrane keys so
301349	that's that's something that we kind of
302699	expect to see they have a very it feels
305159	like a shorter journey not a shorter
307349	travel hard to say but they have very
309000	small key caps and if I had to complain
311250	about something on the keyboard then it
313080	would be that the key caps have a bit of
315659	a wobble to them you see that so while
318659	the actual plunging of the key switch
322520	feels more like a mechanical usually a
325530	cherry MX keyboard tends to have tends
328440	to have a bit of a tighter fit on the
330120	key caps can you see that b-roll usually
332219	tends to have a tighter fit on the key
333810	caps because right now it feels a little
336210	bit unsteady like if I press on one
338009	corner of that key there's more
339750	resistance whereas if I press it
341219	directly then there's less resistance
343490	that said I don't think this would slow
347639	down my loop my typing in anyway so
351449	that's not really going to be points up
354419	actually it feels very natural to type
356340	on there using a unique cyan print on
359219	the key caps themselves so it's dot
360990	doesn't have white printing on it it has
362610	kind of a blue color printing on it that
364740	looks quite unique and I guess it's
366659	probably conclusion time at this point
368130	so what is the nook er it's a very
371310	unique keyboard it's definitely better
374909	than other mechanical keyboards from
377279	what I've felt in my limited time with
379289	it I can already tell you guys there's
380729	no question there it is closer to the
383130	mechanical experience it doesn't offer
384990	the same durability and it doesn't have
387090	the same kind of build quality that
388680	you'd get with something like a mecha g1
390330	but it is better than other mechanical
393240	keyboards so it's kind of like how you
394590	know the Logitech G 15 gen one holds a
396930	special place in many gamers hearts
398639	because even though it was a mechanical
400139	keyboard
401310	was a cut above mechanical keyboard
403140	compared to the other stuff out there so
404940	I guess that makes them kind of similar
406800	better membrane keyboards is this a good
409620	thing yeah probably because not
411120	everyone's going to be able to drop 80
412710	bucks on an entry-level mechanical
414900	keyboard eighty to a hundred dollars
416220	some people are just going to stick with
417840	membrane so we'd rather they at least
419580	have a better membrane keyboard thanks
