930	[Music]
6560	welcome to my unboxing of the Roccat
9059	Sabu this is a midsize hybrid gaming
11670	mouse which I'm not exactly sure what
13349	ibrid means but I guess we'll get to
15599	that later Pro optic sensor so this is
17820	using an optical sensor not a laser
19529	sensor but still capable of 4000 dpi the
22680	DPI is mob size more of a factor if
24960	you're running a very high resolution
26220	screen or like a multi-monitor setup and
27990	anything else because beyond that really
30630	the accuracy of the tracking is more
32790	important than the DPI ok button
35040	duplicator easy shift+ ok we'll figure
39390	out what that is later customizable
41070	lighting multi color so you can change
42750	the lighting to whatever color you want
43829	I guess that's what the rainbow here
44969	means no sweat side grips excellent
47700	Roccat driver and macro presets for
49649	games multimedia and apps five plus two
51449	buttons twelve functions very easy shift
53600	okay that sounds kind of neat
55370	high-quality components for solid build
57360	for long life ok optical sensor twelve
58890	most functions Roccat easy shift ultra
60539	light light system drivers and macros
62430	let's go ahead and open this bad boy up
64349	because Roccat is starting to get a lot
66750	of attention in North America they
68250	haven't really been present here before
69930	but they are now and people are really
73260	talking about it so let's find out what
75119	all of the fuss is about optimum mid
79380	size design with perfectly balanced
81240	weight I do appreciate having adjustable
86009	weight on mice but I understand that
87810	that's not everyone's preference and
90020	while I it's ok okay I should disclaim
92759	that because while I said I do like to
94979	have adjustable weight my actual
97290	favorite Mouse does not have adjustable
99210	weight so my second favorite mouse ever
101070	is the g9 and I haven't tried the g9 X
103350	so I don't I don't know but it's
104729	probably more of the same and it's good
107390	but my favorite mouse is actually the
109860	SteelSeries akari laser which is not
111840	weight adjustable so let's go ahead and
113700	have a look at the aesthetics of the
115170	most so this is excellent grip material
116969	on the side here you can tell right away
119189	it's basically like sandpaper but not
121380	uncomfortable it's like rubber sandpaper
123030	so you'll have the
124900	what it allows is for the sweat to sit
126880	in between the the bumps so you can
129250	still maintain grip on it and it's not
132100	absorbent at all but it should be pretty
133930	durable as well it doesn't feel like the
135520	kind of thing that you could just
136420	scratch off easily in terms of mouse
138670	buttons you've got two here
141160	so there's your backs and forwards
142540	you've got your left and right click you
144010	got your middle click and let's find out
146560	what easy shift is this is my Roccat ID
150400	card it should be noted that it is not
153520	valid unless signed and needs an
155590	authorized signature also this card is
157090	the property of Rockette studios misuse
159280	is a criminal offense really this is not
162640	a valid means of payment ok this video
164020	register your personal ID using this
165820	card on our website so I am going to
169120	take this and I'm going to put this in
171010	my wallet right now because oh no my
173950	wallets full of things like credit cards
176350	and identification ok I guess I'll file
178600	that somewhere else ok moving right
180220	along easy shift you actually kind of
183100	cool so what it does here these are all
185020	the default assignments however once you
186670	install the software you can change them
188350	so here I'm going to demo on the mouse
189820	itself rather than so left click right
191980	click ok this is the easy shift button
194709	so here check this up browser forward
198390	shift browser back ok so scroll up
203380	scroll down shift volume up volume down
206650	so basically shift allows you to press
210160	this and then press any of these other
212500	buttons for different functionalities so
214720	they give you a map of the default
216280	assignments with no driver installed but
218650	you can install the driver and you can
220120	change everything you want they also
221680	give you some examples of what you might
223180	want to do and for example
224230	counter-strike or Wow or multimedia or
226450	browser or whatever else the case may be
229739	Kennedy I think it would take a little
231910	while to get used to but once you do you
234010	could actually effectively have far more
236049	buttons on your mouse than you then you
237640	actually have which is sort of neat ok
240820	so the sensor can deliver 400 800 1600
242980	or 4,000 dpi optimized tracking that
246070	fits any style so has an ultra play 2d
247989	incremental step wheel for perfect
249519	control during weapon changes and other
250660	critical decisions see yeah feels pretty
254500	solid ok I'm down high quality build ah
256870	yes more
257709	German engineering excellent so this
259478	goes along with our theme of German
261608	engineering in our unboxings today which
264639	included the be quiet dark powerboat
267479	dark power Pro power supply and my
271509	rabbit German engineering okay let's
276400	have a look at the mouse itself
277479	physically so you got your slippy pads
279250	on the front in the back you've got your
280780	optical sensor right there in terms of
282970	the size they're calling this a
284500	mid-sized Mouse I'd say this is more on
286090	the smaller side I have pretty small
287740	hands and this is a very very
290080	comfortable size for me in terms of the
292270	grip I'd say it's somewhere between you
294580	can palm it if you want but what you'll
296710	find is I think your pinky will fall off
298539	a little bit so you might want to clot
300669	and I don't think it's really suitable
302979	for fingertip although you could
304330	probably do it because it's got enough
305560	of a contour here and enough of a
306910	contour here that you could probably get
308320	away with it but I'd say this is more of
310509	a claw grip than anything else in terms
313210	of how its most naturally used the top
315550	is is a little bit more smooth but still
319150	grippy compared to the sides where it's
320979	more like that sandpaper finish and the
322990	overall comfort is pretty good actually
324789	like I'm liking it I don't quite like
327699	the positioning of these I wish they
328960	were a little bit lower but there's
332710	still once you actually put it down
334180	they're very reachable and it's not
336009	going to interfere with your ability to
337479	use the mouse otherwise even if you're
339400	holding down one of them as a shift so I
341770	think that pretty much covers it you
343270	know we should plug it in and check out
344380	the lighting effects section just to see
346659	I think it's blue by default just plug
349330	this in there you go actually I'm going
351159	to go turn off the lights that you can
352710	put it next to the Corsair m60 so you
356169	can see what I most with lighting
358389	effects looks like compared to amounts
360460	without lighting effects if you aren't
362949	already aware of what those wood
364990	lighting effects looks like well it's
366550	kind of neat so in the driver you should
367960	be able to configure things like the
369400	colors pulsation and all that good stuff
370840	so thank you for checking on my unboxing
