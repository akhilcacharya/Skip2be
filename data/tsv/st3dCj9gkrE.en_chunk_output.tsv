6200	welcome to a Rhian boxing something we
9090	don't do that often this my friends is
10950	the Coolermaster CM storm quickfire TK
14120	fully backlit mechanical keyboard it has
17279	an extremely clever layout so it
19680	delivers pretty close to a 10 kilo size
22199	so so for those of you who aren't
23910	already sort of familiar with the
26039	terminology that goes along with
27689	mechanical keyboard chopping ten kilos
29910	refers to keyboards that don't have a
31859	number pad but this one does have a
33960	number pad so what they've done is
35969	they've used the number lock to either
38070	enable number pad functionality or
40070	arrows num law or rather print screen
43170	scroll lock pause insert homepage up
45180	delete end page down all that
47010	functionality you can choose whether you
48539	have a number lock or those things which
50430	is actually kind of cool it's available
52230	with a variety of Cherry MX switches
54710	including the very reason that we are
57690	redoing this particular unboxing because
60480	there is a new option for the quick-fire
62520	TK Cherry MX green switches so the
66210	keyboard includes a removable braided
68369	cable as well as a key cap puller and
70890	we're going to use this as an
71970	opportunity to show you guys just
73710	exactly what a cherry MX green switch
76080	looks like ah yes it looks like pretty
78780	much any other cherry MX switch except
80939	for the fact that it is indeed green but
83939	before we get into the typing
85290	impressions from both me and slick let's
87270	do a quick recap of the overall features
89009	here so it has function keys which give
91200	you your media playback play pause stop
92970	backwards forwards mute volume up and
95670	volume down you've also got a Windows
97590	key lock which can be enabled by holding
99450	function and clicking on that one you
100829	can see ah yes it has a backlight so you
103140	can use the function key to control
104820	various types of back lightness so you
107250	can turn it on and off you can adjust
109530	the brightness between five different
111030	levels it actually gets extremely bright
114509	at the brightest level looks very very
116250	very vibrant looks quite nice and you
118590	can choose three different modes for it
120600	so you can have it in breathing mode you
122549	can have it in fully backlit mode and
124439	you can have it in just illuminate the
127049	WASD Keys mode the other thing to watch
129628	out for is when you press the number
131400	lock those arrow keys
132910	that indicates that you are not number
135460	locked which is a little bit
136690	counterintuitive I wish the num lock
138370	illuminated or something like that when
140350	you press num lock and when you were an
141550	unlock mode it has a removable cord as
144280	well as a nice set of ergonomic options
146680	back here so you've got nice little
148240	rubber feet on the top and bottom of the
150640	keyboard as well as rubber tipped feet
153880	that can flip up in order to elevate the
156250	keyboard a touch it does not come with a
158110	wrist rest unfortunately and that is
160330	something that I would have liked to see
162070	included however does a fairly value
163870	conscious option in terms of pricing so
166060	you got to just kind of remember that
167380	that comes with the territory last thing
169390	is with function held you can press the
172420	Escape key and either six or n to choose
175300	between six key rollover which is
177040	compatible with Macs and all pcs so
179440	compatibility mode or any key rollover
182440	which allows you to press all the keys
184240	and have them all register even over USB
186490	but not compatible with Mac and can
189070	cause some pcs to fill the boot so you
190930	can just change that mode back if that's
192970	not working for you the last thing to
194350	cover before we get into the typing
196030	experience is the cable management on
198040	the bottom so the detachable cable can
199720	be routed either straight at the top or
201370	to either the right or left side this is
203290	great for keeping your desk tidy now
205240	typing experience let's start with the
207580	big thing about Cherry MX greens I mean
209320	why are they so rare well because they
212140	require a lot of force to press at 80
215200	grams of actuation force at the
217810	actuation point that is nearly double
219910	what is required for Cherry MX browns
221709	which are a light tactile switch and
224380	Cherry MX Reds which are a light linear
226840	switch so both of those are around 45
228820	grams and it is a full 60 percent higher
232450	than the 50 grams required for Cherry MX
235060	blues which are considered to be a
237370	relatively heavy Cherry switch so with
240940	that said how does it feel for typing
243489	all up for me it was too heavy just
245620	right out of the gate I'm gonna give it
248200	a shot in the longer term here and you
250300	guys can stay tuned on Twitter or in the
252130	forum or whatever else I'll let you know
253540	if I change my mind but I found that it
255910	was just flat out too heavy for anything
258130	but my index finger and my middle finger
260560	so for my ring finger and pinky finger
262390	it was very unnatural for me to type on
264610	it now I
265290	and not a great typist I rarely use my
268320	pinky
268860	so wouldn't have even mattered if it
270840	wasn't too difficult for me to press
272250	with my ring finger without it feeling a
273870	little bit weird so I'm not necessarily
276180	the best person to go okay well he had
278010	trouble typing on it so therefore it is
279900	difficult to type on because slick tried
282090	it too and while he didn't find it as
285360	fast as Cherry MX blue switches not even
287700	by a long shot he didn't find the typing
289830	experience physically difficult because
291570	he just has plain old heavier stronger
294390	fingers to start with so right now we're
297990	kind of going okay results are a mixed
299700	bag it is a different experience and it
301800	is certainly very unique I mean it's
304920	probably the closest we can get with a
306930	Cherry MX which to something like a
309000	buckling spring or even more like a
310740	typewriter field where it really feels
312510	like there's a long sort of resisting
315480	press before you reach that actuation
318000	point but we didn't find it to be
320550	dramatically better than some of the
322140	other more available and less expensive
324270	switches that are out there now I have
326460	seen reports of people saying that they
328590	bought Cherry MX green keyboards and got
331110	used to it over time but I think that'll
333330	depend on a little bit of a long-term
334620	testing session now speaking of getting
336930	used to things over time audible.com you
339630	guys are likely getting used to us
341250	talking about audible but do you think
343110	you could get used to having a
344430	subscription for a new audiobook to
346500	listen to every month I hope so because
348960	audible.com has just such a service and
351270	like anything highly addictive the first
353460	one is free I think we've actually
355620	talked about the Hunger Games by Suzanne
357180	Collins being available on audible.com
359190	before but with Catching Fire coming out
361350	in theaters right now this seems like a
363420	great opportunity to bring it up again
365070	the movie is likely to be awesome but
367260	stop me if you've heard this one before
368610	the book is always better mmm head on
371820	over to audible.com slash Linus for our
373770	free trial and to sign up for a monthly
