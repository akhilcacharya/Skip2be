30	okay so today on my video blog we'll be
1890	checking out the new Razer Naga MMO RPG
4859	Mouse so if I could get the camera lady
7589	as we're making do with today come in
10679	here and have a look this is the
12269	packaging for the Naga you can see that
14370	it's got a little outline of the
16800	features I mean the biggest feature of
18390	this mouse is that you've got 12 buttons
21300	on the side of it so you can map that to
23580	any number of functions but you can see
25380	it comes in Stu to stock configurations
27869	so there's the basic numeric and it'll
30240	map it to these keys and then there's
32130	the advanced and it'll map it to your
34410	number pad so I'm not sure what the
36090	benefit of that is but you use a little
37469	switch on the bottom of the mouse to
39000	switch between them now general features
41489	you've got a 3.5 GAA sensor organ amic
44340	right-handed design so this is not an
46829	ambidextrous design 100,000 Hertz ultra
50250	poling laser and then let's have a look
52620	at the back see if we can find anything
54030	interesting
54600	oh this uses a very very high-end laser
57059	so you've actually got a fifty six
58649	hundred dpi laser and 200 inches per
61109	second of tracking and 50 G's of
63840	acceleration so that's enough spec let's
65549	get this thing out of the box because
67590	that's what you all paid good money to
69090	see this open we just just got these in
72960	so I'm actually quite excited to see
75270	this I'll be looking at it for the first
77009	time as well and we can do a quick
78750	comparison against a couple other mites
80880	that I happen to have at my desk YouTube
82799	so let's get it out of the packing and
86479	okay kind of creates a neat effect like
89369	it's floating in the in the green there
91590	and then you can pull the wire out of
94229	the plastic this way and compared to the
98130	Mamba which I probably wouldn't have
99869	been able to do an unboxing video of
101549	because it was so hard to get out of the
103290	box the Naga is quite painful painless
105509	so you just take the plastic cover off
107369	the bottom peel that up and then there's
110040	another plastic cover protecting just at
113159	the back of the mouse here let's just
114990	take that off too and there we have it
118560	there's oh no there's a couple more
120540	things in here I'm sorry so at the back
122729	we have stuck to it a little pouch which
128098	can
128990	I have no idea what it contains okay it
133460	contains hmm a certificate of
139760	authenticity the nagas grid trainer
143030	whatever that means
144530	so this is kind of seems to be oh this
148340	is kind of oh this is neat these are
150410	little bumps that you can place on the
153530	side buttons to help you orient yourself
155990	so you can use it kind of like the bumps
158780	on the home row keys oh that's that's a
160760	really neat feature because I'm
161780	concerned that a lot of people have had
163520	is that it's hard to feel which button
166040	is which so that's pretty neat and then
168560	there's a Quick Start Guide okay see
171920	when your friends are playing there's
173720	some kind of software add okay Razer
176870	product catalog where you can check out
178700	their other products should you see they
181160	need to do that and this is okay card
185120	that has a picture of the Naga on it and
187490	you've got a couple Razer stickers and
189650	then a master guide so this is the
192410	complete instruction guide including a
194450	message from Razer guy awesome so let's
196970	get this cleared off the desk and let's
199550	get the most itself plugged in here so
201950	I'm just gonna plug it in to the back of
203510	my keyboard let's do a quick size
204710	comparison to actually since I have your
208220	attention here so we've got a couple
211280	mice that I can put next to it I've got
213170	a g9 here and then I have the upcoming
215450	steel series I so that gives you some
217520	idea the the size of the mouse itself
220310	now I want the camera camera lady to try
223430	and get on the other side of me here
225850	there we go so it comes with a total of
230140	17 buttons yeah 17 mm Oh optimized
233360	button so there's two buttons here
234710	you've got 12 buttons on the side which
237560	with my relatively small hands you know
240200	I'm probably gonna have a little bit of
241460	trouble reaching this bottom row but I
243290	should be able to fairly comfortably hit
245300	at least the top six and then the bottom
247400	three without shifting around too much
249170	and then on the other side yeah that's
251660	that's all the buttons so then you've
253490	got your left right middle click to here
255440	and 12 on the side anyway thank you for
257660	checking out the Razer Naga here's the
259850	little switch I talked about where you
261140	can switch between the number key
262520	the number pad and yeah thank you for
265460	checking out my blog I hope you enjoyed
266930	it
