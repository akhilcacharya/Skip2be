30	now it used to be that there was only
1740	one game in town for Blizzard licensed
5310	gaming peripherals but I've already
7500	unboxed one of razor's Blizzard licensed
10889	peripherals and here is another one this
13049	is the Razer Marauder this is a
14910	Starcraft 2 gaming keyboard and we're
17460	going to be having a quick look at it
18990	today first let's see what razer has to
21539	say for themselves on the box here so
23880	first of all 1,000 Hertz ultra polling
26580	so that means that the responsiveness of
28230	this keyboard should be about as good as
29849	it gets
31040	APM lighting system so we'll have to get
33480	into what exactly that is a little bit
35250	later on the fly' macro recording this
37410	is a feature that I love seeing on
39840	keyboards because it makes recording
41460	macros a little bit less tedious if you
43410	don't have to bring up a big old
44789	software program in order to do it
47100	laser-etched keys pool very nice and a
51059	braided fiber cable which we're pretty
52469	used to seeing on any quality Razer
54930	product here we go fully backlit keys
57500	interesting 7-foot lightweight and
59789	untangle cord oK we've covered that APM
62879	lighting system we've covered this to
64409	optimize key travel and spacing this is
66510	a little bit different so what razors
68159	basically saying is that the key travel
70140	which is the distance between being not
72180	depressed and being depressed not to say
74670	sad but rather pressed down is optimized
77939	for presumably RTS gaming integrated
81360	number pad ok that is a keyboard feature
85080	I suppose on the fly macro recording APM
87689	lighting system and elevated keys with
89520	optimized travel distance and spacing so
91049	it's a little bit redundant I guess what
92850	they mean to say is it is a keyboard ok
97770	actions per minute lighting so actions
100290	per minute lighting system that's it you
101970	know I figured that might be what they
103320	mean by APM but I wasn't really sure how
106439	you could have a lighting system that's
108320	actions per minute so we're going to
110369	have to find out exactly what that means
114619	so it looks like there actually isn't a
119280	seal on that side I'm not sure how to
121259	get this box open ah here we go so
124290	there's a seal on this side so it looks
125729	like you can actually only open this box
128098	one way so I'm going to take points off
130110	of the marauder keyboard because
132510	as a nun boxer I like to have the
134640	freedom to choose how I'm going to unbox
136890	my product now I'm just kidding I'm not
139500	going to take any money off the product
141150	because because the Box can only be open
144060	from one side that actually doesn't
146400	bother me very much all right so here's
148349	the marauder keyboard so Wow the box
150360	actually makes it look like if you see
152700	here it's more of a black keyboard but
156450	you can see quite clearly that it's more
158280	of a silver keyboard so if you were
160680	expecting a black keyboard then you
162720	better sort of adjust your expectations
164549	because this is the color scheme that we
167579	actually have going on here
169079	so this says armored assault and
172909	apparently armored assault means lifting
176700	up a tab and pulling out the lining box
181940	okay here we go with the included bits I
184829	mean razors great at presentations so
186720	let's see what they have to say for
187650	themselves first we have the Quick Start
189389	Guide which shows us that is a good idea
192359	to plug it into a USB port and
194510	furthermore that it is a good idea to
197010	register your product so not a whole lot
198660	going on in there next we have some
200699	Razer stickers as I recall these are UV
202620	sensitive only one way to find out for
204690	sure though guys come on let's go find
207000	out if they're UV sensitive so I'm in my
210989	computer room now hold on a second it's
213660	going to turn off the light
216520	and oh they are not UV sensitive bummer
220690	okay never mind that I think they think
223870	it's possible they used to be but at any
226720	rate these ones are not so there that
229090	goes off with the QuickStart guide next
231130	we have the main manual which is in
234610	French master guide there we go
236790	now okay so programming macros using
241180	your marauder
241840	the only reason I have this open right
243610	now is to find out what a PM lighting is
246640	so you can customize the look of the
248680	Marauder by adjusting from over 16
251050	million colors so you can adjust the
254200	main the side strips and the under glow
256360	lighting colors click any of the three
258640	color boxes so you can choose the color
259930	to assign to that lighting area okay a
262029	p.m. in alerts tab so actually for a
263650	minute selection on the top flanked at
265120	the bottom of the drivers allows you to
266320	customize the lighting behavior based on
268150	the number of actions per minutes used
270580	in starcraft2
271950	suite so the more APM's you have while
275350	you're gaming with this keyboard the
277120	more different your lighting scheme will
279640	be so let's have some pretty a pretty
281950	close look at the keyboard itself as far
284320	as keyboards go it's a fairly standard
286030	layout it has letters and it has numbers
289510	and it has some media keys that are
293170	accessed via function key hey this is
295780	smart okay I'm actually wait hold on
298900	is this the way I prefer it yes I
301300	believe this is the way I prefer it I
302530	prefer the windows key over here I know
304030	I'm one of those horrible awful people
306700	who doesn't bump the windows key when
308620	they're trying to game with WASD but I
311050	prefer the function key over here for
312910	these items because think about it this
315040	way if you're going to press function
316420	and this for example to mute your volume
320140	are you going to go like this or would
325660	this be more natural
326620	oh what a concept right oh you know what
328750	we should actually do here let's plug
330610	this thing in so it actually has two
332980	gold plated USB plugs and I'm guessing
335560	it is just for extra power so what I'm
338110	going to do is I'm going to plug these
339220	into my MSI GX 660 our gaming notebook
344169	and see what happens
346540	it lights up look at that
348849	okay I don't have the drivers installed
350319	so I'm not going to be able to do any
351459	additional testing on the different
354459	lighting configurations but that is what
356229	it looks like once it's lit up it's got
357669	a pretty even overall backlight the one
360399	key that I'd say doesn't get as much
361929	love as the others is probably the
363639	Escape key but it looks pretty darn good
366159	even in the bright lights that I have
368619	shining down at me right now so not bad
372550	at all I'll turn those lights off and
373869	I'll give you guys a better look at it
375099	in a moment so let's flip it over and
377080	see what we have to see down here so
380020	first we've got a couple of lighting
381819	strips at the bottom of the keyboard we
383769	have two of those little red risers you
385929	want to Incline the keyboard that's more
388089	comfortable for you
388990	we have rubber pads on the bottom of the
390819	keyboard to keep it from slipping big
392349	ones at the front small ones at the back
394360	so even if you are using those cabs it
396279	shouldn't slip around and then okay I'll
398830	finally get in close and have a look at
400569	what all keys you guys are going to find
402279	here so function keys we've got mute
403959	volume up volume down
405279	we've got play stop forward back and
408399	then we have oh oh
410879	hmm this appears to be brightness on and
416079	off okay and this oh okay is for gaming
421059	mode versus not gaming mode which
422439	probably turns off the windows key that
425050	would be my guess okay here we have oh
427059	this is interesting so we've taken the
429459	insert homepage out delete and then page
431499	down and we've put them all in the
433059	number pad which I actually can't decide
437110	if it bothers me or not I'm going to go
439809	ahead and say no for now because we can
441939	always go into number mode and then we
444129	still have insert home and page up now
446649	what I probably would have done was I
448029	probably would have gone like a delete
451860	home or a delete page up and page down
454809	or something to find like sort of three
456759	useful keys and leave them here even a
459279	number pad mode but I mean it's it's up
461769	in a but it's never easy when you're
463899	trying to decide how to sort of butcher
466029	a keyboard layout to condense it so you
468249	know they chopped it up and they did the
469839	best they could here are the arrow keys
471309	if you're not a number mode so yeah yeah
473649	you know it's not bad it makes it more
475029	compact I mean it's a lot shorter than
476729	than a typical keyboard I mean here's a
479079	standard layout keyboard this is a
480610	SteelSeries 70
482110	so you can see that it is a good like
484419	how much Lobster is this it's like a
486789	good two and a half three inches shorter
488050	than a 7g keyboard so here's our little
493659	Starcraft 2 thing overall feel of the
495879	keys honestly isn't exceptional I mean
497860	I'm not going to lie to you guys it's a
499360	it's a gaming keyboard it's not a
501340	mechanical keyboard like their Black
503199	Widow series so you're not going to get
505090	that great tactile feedback however I
508740	can't really comment on how well
511060	optimised it is for RTS gaming but I can
514029	tell you guys that they feel like very
515708	adequate key switches especially
517919	considering the fact they are not
519958	mechanical key switches so what I'm
522250	going to do is I'm going to turn off
523089	these lights and give you guys a look at
525820	what the keyboard looks like there's my
528700	Star Wars shirt I'm so cool when the
533800	lights are dimmed yeah you can see it's
540370	much more noticeable the Escape key
542350	doesn't get much lighting because you
543910	can see the laser etched keys allow the
546850	backlight to show through okay remember
549550	these are not blue colored these are
551500	actually just lit up by the blue light
554470	behind them seeing all of the edgings on
556750	the keys so it looks pretty sweet in the
560529	dark guys don't forget to subscribe to
563440	Linus tech tips for more unboxings
565269	reviews and other computer videos and
568570	thank you for watching my unboxing of
570279	the Starcraft 2 Razer marauder keyboard
