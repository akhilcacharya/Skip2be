930	[Music]
6799	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9480	the SteelSeries call of duty black ops 2
12210	Gaming Mouse now Black Ops 2 might have
15179	been a bit of a how you say less than
20250	successful game launch considering you
22590	know the black ops are the Call of Duty
24359	lineage of it however there's nothing
26310	you know not awesome about this Mouse so
29250	we're also gonna have a look at the call
31170	of duty black ops 2 mousepad which is
33270	basically one of their qcks my mouse
35880	pads with black ops branding on it so
37890	we'll start with that guy you can
39210	actually see already even though I
40680	haven't unboxed it yet what it's going
42570	to look like because this is a steel
44700	series qck Diablo 3 branded mousepad so
48300	it'll be like that except with a
49649	different picture on it a very different
51690	picture on it a black ops 2 picture on
54570	it so it comes in a package that might
59670	lead you to believe that it's a hard
61050	mousepad but it actually isn't it is a
63960	cloth mousepad on a hard backing there
66090	we go
66770	it is as I said before pretty much the
70560	same as the other one so we can go ahead
72810	and we can add to my stack of qcks that
75479	I have going on here Denton black ops 2
79140	qck looks pretty good right comes with a
82140	little steel series brochure about some
84810	of their other cool products including
86430	mice keyboards headsets all kinds of
88229	great stuff SteelSeries sticker and that
90390	pretty much does it for that now this
92009	almost looks perfect
93390	but if we move the SteelSeries sensei
95369	that I use for my test bench then we can
98130	see what it looks like with the proper
99570	call of duty black ops 2 mess so let's
100920	have a look at what they have to say for
101850	themselves arm yourself with a weapon
103560	design firm hours of Planets to me to
105390	the black ops 2 Edition Mouse ok and
107460	being extra shape optimized for all
109259	types of gamer grips palm claw and swipe
112920	gaming grade switches have a lifespan of
114479	10 million clicks which is an awful lot
117329	of clicks although if you're some of
119310	those you know I don't know if you're
120630	Korean or something then you may
122189	actually need more clicks than that and
124439	the lifespan of a mouse because of you
125880	know actions per minute and whatnot you
127860	know what that would be a great
128699	calculation I would love for someone to
130739	run these numbers because it would be
132060	hilarious so take the
133440	actions per minute of one of the top
135180	sort of you know Starcraft 2 players and
137670	then figure out how long it would take
139920	them if they were playing constantly to
142320	actually use the left click ten million
144510	times it'd be just kind of hilarious
146910	let's find out what it would take to
148800	actually kill the switches on this mouse
152160	to the point where they they cannot
154110	operate anymore so there we go that's
157080	what the mouse looks like I'm gonna go
158610	ahead and pull that out of there let's
160710	go ahead and see what else SteelSeries
161910	has to say for themselves
163140	programmable illumination options for
165330	the scroll wheel back and CPI toggle
168060	eight organically placed buttons seven
170160	programmable buttons supported by steel
171960	series engine technology offering
173130	operation configuration customization of
175230	advanced macros across steel series
176880	peripherals so the counts the frames per
179460	second is twelve thousand the count
181020	sprint is 92 five thousand six hundred
182910	and seventy as as many as you'll need
184350	remember guys steel series uses counts
186600	per inch because they find it actually
188070	gives a more accurate representation of
189930	how the mouse performs compared to dpi
192390	which is dots per inch
194090	one hundred and fifty inches per second
196620	is the the resolution I believe is the
198750	terminology for that guy acceleration is
200880	it up to 30 G's lift instance is
202620	approximately two millimeters as eight
204239	buttons now steel series has one of the
206520	best software configuration utilities
209340	that I have ever seen it's right up
211410	there with guys like Logitech I mean
213300	here's the thing this is what a lot of
215400	people don't really seem to get is that
216930	almost everyone in their dog makes a
218970	gaming mouse it's actually not
220650	complicated
221489	I could I could get fine-tuned OEM that
224250	would make a gaming mouse for me it
225930	could be the Linus Mouse guys feel free
228540	to like the video if you think that's a
229680	great idea anyway I could do that but
231989	the part where I'd have trouble is the
233459	software SteelSeries has advanced
235320	software functionality that allows you
237209	to turn on or off things like angle
239040	snapping things like correction for
241980	slight imperfections in your movement
243959	which I turn off because in gaming that
245850	stuff's totally useless if you're trying
247530	to make my neat adjustments to your
249120	mouse as well as things like being able
251040	to adjust the CPI to a fine level of
254180	perfection that's exactly perfect for
256290	your style compared to other software
258298	that's out there so for cheaper or less
260940	sort of reputable peripherals you know
264750	what you're probably losing the value on
266729	the software
267270	that's probably where you're getting the
268620	shaft so it won't happen with the
270360	SteelSeries peripheral in fact you
272160	especially won't see that happen with
273750	something like the call of duty black
274770	ops mouse because as you may or may not
276090	have noticed this is the same mouse as
278789	the sensei look at that it just has a
281430	call of duty black ops graphic on it
283500	it's actually if anything I'd say it's a
285030	little bit better because it has a soft
286500	touch feel to the top of it whereas the
288509	sensei has kind of a hard plastic shiny
291180	feel to it and I find this much more
292979	comfortable this feels a lot like my I
294360	carry laser upstairs on my gaming rig so
297360	if you guys don't know a lot of people
298830	have asked me my favorite mouse ever
300750	ever ever is the iqari laser from steel
303690	series the sensei has not displaced it
306240	because I am right-handed and I do like
308009	that right-handed ergonomic shape but
309990	what a lot of gamers like about steel
311580	series as it is ambidextrous you can use
313470	it left-handed if you want they've even
315449	made it ambidextrous see I've seen
317400	ambidextrous mice that are ambidextrous
320039	in shape but then they only have thumb
322139	buttons on the one side to which I would
324210	go well that's not very ambidextrous at
326129	all because then left-handed players
327629	have no fun buttons but steel series
329789	goes as far with the sensei as to put
331469	two thumb buttons on either side both of
333330	which are completely programmable you
335130	also have a CPI switcher on the top this
337229	guy right here I believe can also be
338819	programmed to do other things although
340110	correct me if I'm wrong on that one guys
341669	but this light turns on and off
343560	depending on which CPI profile you're
345449	using see I can move that you can also
347310	change the lighting here here and on the
349440	back of the mouse which I might as well
351090	plug in and see what it looks like by
353400	default go ahead and plug this bad boy
355979	into the USB port ah looking good so you
360930	can change the color of that illuminated
362729	to there see that's what it looks like
364500	with it off actually that looks really
365639	cool I was very stealthy the way that
367469	they've implemented that so it comes
368729	orange by default and gaming grade laser
371669	ah yes this is another thing pet peeve
373770	for mice and you know what I've seen
376680	even like even fairly reputable guys do
379259	this a mouse sensor is not all about how
382289	many dots per inch or counts per inch or
384330	acceleration or blah blah blah all those
386460	specs in the world mean absolutely
388080	nothing until you actually plug it into
390389	a system and actually run a game on it
392719	honestly I was really excited about the
395190	Logitech g600 super excited I was so
397949	excited I was like this is the perfect
399509	Mouse it's ergonomically shaped it
401009	awesome buttons and stuff and then I
403349	plugged it into my computer and this
404729	feels laggy how am I supposed to use it
407069	I've never encountered that the
408930	SteelSeries mouse whether it's AK in
410399	zoos I sensei I carry laser or I mean
415169	probably this one given this the same
416580	exact same thing as this never
418379	encountered that before so the quality
420059	of the optics they're using in here the
422189	actual lasers and the sensors and the
424740	processors and everything that they're
425969	doing it has always been very consistent
428129	for me so there I enjoy Joyce Oh enjoy
431599	SteelSeries noise thank you for watching
434460	and don't forget to subscribe
