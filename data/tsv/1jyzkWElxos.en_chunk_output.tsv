30	so this video from CES 2018 is brought
2730	to you by group Renault check out our
4770	video there symbiote Zelo car at the
6960	link in the video description Haji bow
9269	are you ready I'm ready for anything
14429	well I'm ready for anything that I've
16650	been programmed to be ready for it so as
18810	you can probably imagine team G bow was
22260	well let's just say they recognized our
25289	crew when we were walking by on the show
28410	floor here at CES and they actually had
32070	some pretty specific responses to some
35370	of the criticisms we had of their geebo
38040	home robot first of all Haji bow who's
42930	the President of the United States
47450	Donald Trump is the president of the
49860	United States so there you go Jibo knows
52500	what's up now and they've made a lot of
55410	improvements since then rolling out OTA
57840	updates about every two weeks now
60359	there's actually been one small hardware
62160	tweak as well the screen has been
63870	swapped out for a higher resolution one
66240	with rounded corners unfortunately it's
68549	not OLED this supply is just not there
71010	yet but hey it's a small improvement and
74729	we'll take it now let's talk about the
77130	software updates because there have been
78299	a ton tweaks to camera processing for
81390	better pictures what they're calling
83189	fresh and lively features to make Gebo a
85530	little more topical like a snow globe
87240	during the holidays geebo can now play
89460	music through iHeartRadio so at this
91710	time there's not a ton you can do in
93210	terms of voice controls and he still
95100	doesn't support services like Spotify
96360	but they are expecting to add more
98549	services and the ability to do things
100380	like TiVo play the next song in the near
103409	future the team has added a new
105119	commander mode that actually allows you
107159	to see through G Bo's eyes which lights
109890	up a purple LED revealing that G bow has
113009	full RGB lighting in his LED strip and
116159	in fact there is probably other hardware
119159	lying dormant under the hood and the
121229	GEVO team has in fact confirmed that for
123420	us another feature of commander mode is
125430	the ability to type a message and have G
128220	Bo say it - Texas is the best so you can
131129	be looking around you can go hey this
132599	room's pretty messy
133830	hey there's my son yo kid clean your
136020	room and giba will say it well in a in a
138390	nicer way geebo now uses information
140460	from Google in addition to the previous
143040	sources and can also do live sports
145260	tours even adding a little bit of color
147570	commentary to the mix like the Celtics
150690	are crushing the Knicks integration with
153030	Philips hue nest and Allrecipes is
156270	coming as is a find my phone function
159390	something that I'm sure that we can all
160800	relate to a big priority for the
162870	development team is personalized report
164850	so debo will see you and say something
167610	like hey Linus you got to get going oh
170460	by the way it's raining so you might
172320	want to grab an umbrella on your way out
173700	the door or if I were to give debo an
176220	instruction like when you see my wife
178230	can you ask her to pick up some
180330	groceries next time she's at the grocery
182610	store debo can pass along that
184650	instruction using his facial recognition
186750	now to be clear I still have a lot of
191190	doubts about Jibo and for that matter
193770	smart assistants in general for as long
196800	as they are stationary but it's clear
199800	that the geebo team is a taking feedback
201720	seriously and be continuing their
204330	software development work so I do look
206640	forward to seeing how it continues to
208739	change in the future and we will be able
210720	to do that because the winning bid for
212430	our sign G bow was an epic troll so we
214590	still have it thanks for checking out
217470	this video from CES 2018 this video was
220140	brought to you by group Rando you guys
222150	got to check out their symbioses demo
224700	car we've got a video linked in the
226350	description but they did a full demo
228690	allowing me to take it out on real
231840	French roads with real drivers around at
234390	a level for autonomous operating level
238380	so that means that I was sitting in that
240420	thing going okay I'm leaned way back
243090	there's a big screen here I cannot even
246180	see over the dashboard and this car is
248670	straight up driving itself telegraphing
250890	its moves around other vehicles as we
252630	change lanes and even being able to
255090	operate autonomously with the driver
257790	wearing a VR headset I was a driver I
260728	was wearing a VR headset and they had
262650	the sensors of the car actually dialed
265050	into the VR headset
266450	and the programming for it so that you
268730	could be driving in this like
270410	fantastical environment like I had like
272300	a flock of birds go by and I kind of
274130	went like this and it was an actual car
276370	totally crazy go check it out to see
279170	what group renault is doing in the space
281420	of autonomous car innovation so thanks
