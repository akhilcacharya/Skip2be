30	the days of Logitech rehashing the g15
2730	slightly with every new gaming keyboard
5130	are over their last flagship refresh the
8340	g7 10 plus was a huge departure from the
12090	usual and was their first mechanical
13860	gaming keyboard featuring Cherry MX
15780	switches and the g9 10 the one we'll be
18480	looking at today is a mechanical
20730	keyboard but instead of going with the
22740	industry standard Cherry MX or can't get
26010	enough allocation of cherry standard
27990	kyla they've worked with Omron on a new
30929	exclusive switch type Romer G mechanical
34590	switches want to know if the g9 10 will
37079	take your gaming to the next level watch
38700	on and oh yeah we've got our BenQ
41510	24-inch XL 24 20 G hybrid engine g-sync
45239	gaming monitor video coming soon

65610	more physical tour time this keyboard
69659	has everything a 140 layout with full
73770	anti-ghosting nine extra macro ready
76619	programmable G keys on the left and top
78869	of the WASD gaming area each of which
81330	can toggle between three different
82439	layers of functionality per profile a
84900	USB to cord with rugged strain
87119	protection media control keys in the top
89520	right including a rubberized volume
91860	wheel nice touch logitech gaming mode to
94470	disable the windows Keys backlight
96659	toggle not one but two included wrist
99270	rests wonderful rubberized angle
101790	adjusters on the bottom a freaking dock
103890	for your phone to sit in so you can like
106439	see in your peripheral vision while
107909	you're gaming and full RGB LED
111119	backlighting on each key so that you can
113579	see that while you're gaming as well so
116189	let's start with the switches shall we
118110	what a roamer G switches exactly well
121290	they were created in partnership with
122820	Omron so you can bet some science went
125700	into the development they feature a 70
128068	million keystroke endurance rating a
130520	one-upmanship fu to Razer sixty million
133110	if I
133530	I saw one they require 45 grams of four
136920	similar to Cherry MX Reds which are very
138930	popular among gamers they actuate after
141360	only 1.5 millimeters of travel compared
144600	to Cherry MX is 2 millimeters they have
147000	a wider base for theoretically less key
149250	wobble although I found them comparable
151290	to a cherry MX keyboard with decent key
153150	caps on it and they were made with
154980	backlighting in mind
156720	featuring a surface mounted RGB LED at
159810	the bottom for better reliability
161580	compared to key switch mounted LEDs and
163800	a light tube down the center of the
166290	switch for more even lighting and less
168510	spillover around the keys compared to
170880	Cherry's RGB design found on the k70 RGB
174920	okay line it's enough reading off
177120	logitech sight what do you think
181010	truthfully it took me a while to decide
183060	they're just so different from anything
186150	that I've used before like rubber domes
188670	as you apply pressure they hold hold
190920	hold hold them seem to collapse with a
193410	bit of a mushy feeling but tactile
195540	sensation but unlike rubber domes they
198690	don't need to be bottom doubt to
200760	register a keystroke making this one of
203160	the most responsive keyboards I have
205380	ever used and not just for gaming
208320	typing - so while hardcore Cherry MX
211170	enthusiasts myself included might not
213870	find the experience that satisfying
216780	especially if you like that crisp sound
219510	of MX blues or greens the performance is
224209	undeniable and for the majority of
226560	gamers out there who are still using
228329	rubber domes Logitech and Omron have
231060	successfully engineered a much better
233549	upgrade that will still feel comfortable
235620	and familiar so I consider the g9 tens
238500	Romer G key switches a smashing success
241310	it's just too bad that Logitech paired
243870	them with the worst key caps I've ever
245880	used in my life the very worst like not
248970	just oh I guess they could tweak this
250920	and optimize that to make it better next
252420	time but like Logitech scrap these
254840	Logitech calls these performance facet
257940	key caps and instead of being gently
260010	curved to embrace your fingers as they
262590	press down on them they have this harsh
264440	angular shape to them that makes about
267330	much sense to me as a shirt made out of
269699	square folded cardboard the idea is that
273030	they keep your fingers centered on the
274860	keys and also improve performance when
277139	they're struck on the edge this is meant
279060	to be beneficial for extremely high APM
281669	gaming but even though based on
284009	programmer feedback they've supposedly
286199	reduced the height of the ridges once
288090	already I just found myself getting
290969	caught on them when moving quickly
292800	between keys so they actually slow me
295050	down
295889	unless I take a higher less efficient
298560	path between keys and then to make
300930	matters worse they aren't even all the
302639	same making it really hard to get used
305219	to them the printing on the arrow keys
307379	and WASD I guess is designed to help you
310259	feel your way back without looking but
311879	it just feels weird on the fingers then
314159	the gaming half of the keyboard so the
316229	left gets three angled grooves while
318810	everything else gets too and when I say
321000	everything I mean not everything because
323400	some random stuff like the left cap
325529	shift and control are mostly flat and
328169	the windows key is convex what on earth
331590	were they thinking and then the supreme
334379	deal-breaker here is that because these
336090	aren't cherry MX keys which is the stems
338400	are not compatible so you'll good luck
340740	finding sensible replacements if you
342930	otherwise really like the g9 10
345270	what a shame because there's stuff I
347699	really like about it I see a Logitech
350219	getting flack about the arcs dock but as
353039	an original g15 user who isn't trying to
356250	cram a tablet or a phablet into it it's
358620	a welcome addition for me the app does
360719	still need some work like I'm not sure
362219	who derped and put the tabs which are at
363870	the bottom where it's almost impossible
365370	to reach without mashing your f keys but
367440	you can switch profiles monitor some
370500	rudimentary system info and use your
372089	phone as a media remote and more
373710	importantly you can see notifications on
375449	your phone as they come in without
376620	paying like 20 bucks for a phone stand
378120	so Rock'em Logitech and while we're on
380099	the subject of rock and stuff aside from
382349	the media and profile keys being stuck
384719	orange and blue for some reason the RGB
387060	backlighting looks great on this
389580	keyboard even the stylized keys I'm the
392099	ones with words printed on them are
393930	really evenly lit and Logitech software
396479	is easier to use than Corsairs and
398909	includes a grater for
400350	of lighting effects then razors did the
402180	last time I looked at it
403410	there's breathing with speed control a
405690	twinkling star effect with customizable
408180	colors a full spectrum color cycle with
410850	speed control configurable color waves
413100	that go horizontal top-down or out from
415230	the center with speed control and a two
417810	color reactive typing mode with speed
420300	control there's also a mode that shows
422640	the active game keys while gaming
424770	depending on your profile another that
426870	allows you to set up different zones
428280	with different colors and finally
430020	freestyle mode which lets you set every
432210	K a different color if you desire
433980	they've still got some work to do here
436230	other than setting a dimmer version of a
438480	color or turning the key of the
440640	backlight off entirely with a button
442380	there's no brightness control
444000	you can't save and recall favorite
446670	freestyle designs without manually
448470	recreating them and lighting can't
450690	change on a per profile basis but it's a
453420	very decent starting point they've got
454920	time to fix those things and that's what
457770	I think the G 910 is it's a starting
460170	point for Roemer G switches which I
462120	think have a very bright future
464390	once they're surrounded by a keyboard
466920	that isn't let down by other poor design
469170	choices which reminds me I haven't even
471180	talked about the wrist rest yet Logitech
474090	includes two wrist rests in the box but
476640	instead of having like a stylized gamer
479250	one with a nice wide resting area on for
482550	the left hand and then nothing for the
484590	right and then a symmetrical one since
486900	most of the gamers I know also type from
489150	time to time and it's nice to have both
490590	wrists on the wrist rest they include
492960	two different size gamer ones I yeah
497000	speaking of different sizes are you sick
499410	of having to select a specific size for
501630	your phone plan before you know how much
503490	you're actually going to use if so you
505470	might want to check out ting a mobile
