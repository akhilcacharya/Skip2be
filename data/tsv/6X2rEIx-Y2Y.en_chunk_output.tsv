7160	welcome to my unboxing of the Diablo 3
10160	mouse from Steel series so this isn't
11719	the first time SteelSeries has released
13430	a license blizzard product but this is
15740	the first time that I've seen their
17869	mouse
18650	be basically just like a themed version
20930	of one of their other mice which I
22730	already know is awesome so I don't even
24470	have to speculate in fact my SteelSeries
26810	eye is right over there I use it on my
29030	test bench and it is a fantastic mouse
31039	so it can only be made better by like
33829	Diablo themed artwork and a Diablo
35899	themed GUI that allows you to easily map
38360	okay here look I'll let them worried it
40460	the way they want to quick and
41870	effortlessly remap the mouse buttons
43609	with drag-and-drop predefined game
45530	actions and functions and skills as well
46940	as elimination settings all of which are
48530	easily configured in the thing that
50300	looks like this we're gonna load up the
51499	driver and show you guys on the computer
53389	behind me in a minute but let's talk
54829	about what else SteelSeries has to say
56389	about this mouse first optimal comfort
58579	with an ambidextrous shape and size
60079	making it versatile for all types of
61519	gamer grips the zai is that as well
64760	so there you go that's pretty
66080	straightforward 7 ergonomically placed
67990	organically organ Amma Klee placed
69770	programmable buttons world's most
71450	durable switches so these are Omron
72979	switches guaranteed for 10 million
74780	clicks which means that no matter how
77030	high your actions per minute actually if
79009	you know your actions per minute then
81020	you can actually calculate exactly how
83359	long this mouse is guaranteed to last
85100	for you if you sat and gamed like 100
88369	percent of the time until it died well
90859	you'd probably die first but there you
92420	go
92630	there you go the mouse that lives longer
93950	than you ah programmable Diablo 3 themed
97929	illumination options so that's the
99799	scroll wheel the CPI indicator as well
101750	as the logo at the back and durable
103909	double braided nylon cord with gold
105740	plated USB connector now this brings me
107899	back to a video I did recently which is
109609	totally unrelated to this where I
111590	compared the performance of an SSD drive
115759	with various SATA cables including SATA
118070	2 cables and SATA 3 cables and there was
120950	a lot of debate after that video where I
123140	basically determined that it didn't
124819	affect the performance about why the
127369	performance wasn't affected or what kind
129649	of cables they were or whatnot and there
131480	were a lot of comments about how it
135050	would have been better if it was
136100	gold-plated or silver
137620	and a lot of debate about what's the
139540	best conductor so I'm gonna settle this
141010	once and for all silver is the best
144190	electrical conductor better than copper
146379	but it's expensive silver also has the
149590	enormous disadvantage of easily
151599	tarnishing that is it easily oxidizes
154660	when it's exposed to air so that means
156940	that there is a less conductive layer
158980	that forms almost immediately with
161620	silver okay so that's why we use copper
164140	because it's cheap and it doesn't
165220	tarnish now why do we use gold to plate
168280	the end of a connector if it's not as
170230	good of a conductor as either silver or
172840	copper why do you think that is the
177489	reason is that gold is malleable gold is
181180	soft so what that means is that every
184150	time you insert it the gold is able to
186760	actually make a very small very very
189010	small but it'll give way a little bit to
191500	the metal from the other end of the
192940	connector making you able to have a
195640	perfect connection every time that is
198099	why we gold plate connectors also it
200260	never tarnishes and never oxidizes that
203709	is why we use gold not because it is the
205630	best conductor
206500	so that is why SteelSeries has gold
209109	plating on the connectors inside there
211000	and then this is unnecessary but it
212950	looks like they've also gold-plated the
214269	outer housing those are the important
215920	parts though those got to be gold-plated
217690	so here's the double braided nylon cord
219849	which actually feels like thicker than
222880	most of the braided cords that I've
224200	encountered in the past also has a
225370	little red stripe just you know kind of
228010	neat
228430	haven't seen that before either all
231459	right here it only makes sense that
233560	since I recently unboxed some Diablo 3
235750	mouse pads here let's go with let's go
237310	with the plain-jane Diablo 3 one so here
240040	you know showcase it there so let's
242500	let's go over the overall the overall
244239	Mouse here so what makes this mouse
245829	truly ambidextrous because lots of mice
248290	have ambidextrous shapes is the fact
250660	that all of the buttons are equally
253090	accessible regardless of whether you use
254769	it with a right hand
255849	or a left hand because check this out
257738	you've got your front and back buttons
259478	here remember these are all fully
260649	programmable so if you're left-handed
262029	you can make this back in your browser
263440	and this forward in your browser and
265110	you've got them on the other side so
267550	that means that if you're right-handed
268419	you can program these two
270080	something with your other fingers and
271490	use them like this and if you're
272720	left-handed and you can do it the other
273949	way around
274729	you've also got your CPI change button
277879	although you can change the sorry yeah
279949	your CPI change button as well as your
281990	CPI indicator LED so remember
283759	SteelSeries uses CPI because according
286699	to their literature it is a more
288169	accurate representation of the actual
290659	sensitivity of the mouse that has the
292610	counts per inch
293689	they believe is more accurate than dots
295759	per inch so they always use CPI to rate
298400	their mice
299150	so unlike their competitors SteelSeries
301669	allows you to adjust your CPI in fairly
304219	small increments the Akari laser that I
305990	have actually allows increments of 1 CPI
308210	but it's not quite that granular anymore
311030	this one allows adjustments in 100 CPI
313849	switch is still better than most of
315139	their competitors which are more like
316729	along the lines of like 400 800 1200
318830	1600 and those are the only intervals
321830	that you can pick so they still give you
323360	a great degree of granularity and you
325490	just use this button to switch between
326750	them so they are some of the most
329539	customizable mice on the market because
332180	you can change everything from your from
334669	your I can't even remember what it's
337310	called but you can change how much
338690	correction it adds to a straight line
340849	can't remember what it's called so I
342529	have mine set to absolutely none zero
344379	correction and then you can have you
346310	have a bunch of settings in between and
347629	you can actually properly control all of
350419	your sensitivities your average plain
352069	gin and even some of your high-end mice
353599	do not allow you to do that they go with
355759	400 800 1200 well that's not granular
357889	enough so there you go that's why I
359569	personally love steel series mice not
362539	really sure where I was going with that
363650	anymore steel series gaming great engine
365719	at the bottom we've got our slippy pads
367580	which I'm sure there's probably a more
369770	you know official name for them this is
371120	a laser mouse so you got your little
372949	laser class1 logo so basically don't put
374960	your eye right up to this and turn it on
376339	you know it's not good on the top of the
378860	mouse right right I was telling talking
380330	about the CPI button there we go I'm
381770	caught up again hey check this out
383240	they've upgraded the scroll wheel so
385759	that is a clickable button and then it
387680	is also a rubberized like Diablo 3
390800	looking scrolling wheel thing going on
392990	you know what I already like this mouse
394759	a lot more than his eye and that is for
397039	one major reason cuz I for all its
400159	awesomeness
402080	is not as grippy overall this is a very
405310	plasticky shiny slippery surface
408169	compared to the Diablo 3 Mouse which has
410599	as I accidentally spat on it while I was
412490	talking they're much better now okay
414409	whereas this one has like a rubberized
416780	soft touch feel throughout the entire
419090	Mouse I personally find it easier to
420979	pick up a mouse that has that finish on
422840	it and I find it to be less clammy
426080	feeling especially when you game for a
428060	while and you get a little bit sweaty
429349	the Diablo 3 logo here at the back
431330	lights up and I think we've covered the
432889	physical attributes of the mouse pretty
434330	well now let's go ahead and install the
436250	install the drivers so we're having a
438500	quick look at the software which
439669	actually provides an astounding amount
441469	of customization I mean it's it's at the
443659	point where it's actually a little bit
444889	ridiculous because you go ahead you
446840	click on a button you can change
448490	everything about it from the name to the
450500	tooltip to the key color to the text
453229	color that shows up to the key font you
456770	can change from action types like macros
458479	launch applications sable key you can
461090	record delays or not record delays when
462740	you're doing your macros there's a dance
464150	edit option here too well edit macros in
467330	a more advanced way you can create
469129	different profiles and your profiles can
471560	be for different types of characters
475400	within the game Diablo 3 or within
477409	whatever other game you want in spite of
479240	the fact that this is Diablo three
480500	themed you can actually use it in a lot
482240	of different ways so there's single keys
484339	here comes with a bunch of
485659	pre-configured stuff and then there's
487250	custom oops
488990	yeah custom ones here that you can
490339	create using the new action button down
492229	here alright what else we got in here so
495169	moving over to the Settings tab we see
496789	we can adjust the CPI so the counts per
498860	inch so that's either with the LED off
500900	or the LED on you have two easy switch
502909	profiles that we can switch between we
504740	can also adjust the polling rate and the
506750	lighting on the mouse so I haven't
507860	actually shown the lighting on the mouse
509089	yet but check it out
510139	the Diablo 3 logo CPI indicator as well
513078	as the mouse wheel are all illuminated
516380	so it can pulsate fast or slow and it
518240	can be brighter or less bright ok what
521179	else we got here moving over to
522620	properties so we can set different
524630	profiles to launch when different
526370	trigger games are launched and check
528740	this out this is statistics so this is
530240	like an odometer for your mouse so you
532160	can go either currents
533630	or lifetime clicks and it will actually
535970	track according to this this zone up
539630	here how many times like how often that
542089	mouse button gets used in relation to
543589	the other one so clearly on the left
545120	click kind of guy and I don't use my
547519	middle click very often however if I
549649	take my middle click and I click it like
551290	50 times here you're gonna see that if I
554420	navigate away from here a solo sorry
555829	this is gonna take a second guys still
561649	clicking okay done clicking now I'm just
563870	gonna like navigate away and come back
565190	and my middle click huh it's using
569029	lifetime clicks now right I think it
573949	takes a second to update so give it a
575660	minute yeah there we go so my left
578449	button now has much less frequency in
580579	relation to Oh was I accidentally
583699	clicking the right button while I was
585259	doing that
585800	Oh oops whatever so it readjusts
587720	according to what buttons you press
589670	kinda hilarious so thank you for
591589	checking out my unboxing and first look
