30	synergy 2 is available now and makes
2490	sharing a keyboard and mouse between two
4380	systems
5069	so simple that anyone could do it check
6960	it out in the link of the description
8220	down below we're going in wind checking
10469	out the 915 full tower chassis as you
13320	can see there is a lot of curved
15420	aluminum this case uses all aluminum
17609	minimum three millimeters thick
19230	normally here there's a tempered glass
21029	side panel it would look like that
23070	there's another tempered glass side
24779	panel on the back the curvature of the
27090	case as you can see there's a big nice
28769	curve along the front of the case and on
31140	the back is to house this top mechanical
34620	unit you can see when I press this
35820	button it goes down when I press the
38160	button again it goes up as you may have
40440	expected also when you turn the computer
42690	off about roughly 10 ish seconds later
45899	it will automatically go down that is to
48570	prevent dust from just floating into the
50610	computer it could have maybe solved this
52800	with a just a dust cover or something
55559	like that but that's not as cool as a
57420	mechanized top that has like glass on it
59520	so you can properly see all your fans
61410	it looks great now you might be
63840	wondering due to this curved front and
66150	this curved back how do you get to your
68580	radiator and stuff or how do you plug
70290	things in will you get to your radiator
72210	by opening up this back with two captive
75030	thumb screws once you unscrew them they
76530	stay there these are fully unscrewed
77909	right now you open it up this is how you
80220	would plug things like cables or flash
81960	drives in you'd run it through the
83430	grating in the back if it's a cable or
85290	you just leave it where it is if it's a
86640	flash drive then there's two captive
89250	screws again on the bottom of this large
91590	unit where you can see the motor for
93900	making the thing go up and down you undo
96299	those slide the whole thing back and up
98579	and it releases just the mechanism for
101250	the panel not the fan or the radiator
103770	then you would access the fan or the
105450	radiator by releasing a screw that's
107700	right up near the front of the case
109200	lifting that entire unit out then you
111360	can change things put on a radiator put
113520	on fans - all that kind of stuff outside
115020	of the case mount that inside put this
117299	mechanism back swing this thing back in
119460	do the thumb screws and it's all closed
122460	up moving on to the inside of the main
125009	system compartment of the case you can
126780	see there's quite a few fans there's two
128729	fans right here there's three more fans
130860	in the front
131540	and there's one fan in the back the
133579	breathability of this case however is
135319	slightly questionable there's some funky
138439	stuff going on there is that large
140409	really good-looking aluminum curved
143000	panel in the front but it's solid I
145609	can't breathe through that there's
146840	nowhere for it to breathe at the top
148010	there's nowhere for it to breathe at the
149120	side where the front breathes it's
151340	actually through the bottom you can see
153019	that the dusts filter at the bottom
155420	actually extends all the way to the
157370	front of the case capturing where these
159260	few fans are so they have a little bit
162409	of place to breathe from but there's
163790	three of them so they're not going to be
165500	pushing a huge amount of air through
167239	that tiny little area but I guess you
168769	could open the door if you wanted and
170239	then they have a massive amount of place
171739	to breathe from but no filter so it's up
174169	to you these bottom two that are just
176629	above like the power supply shroud which
179000	is included and goes fully across the
180769	case would breathe through the bottom
183019	and the bottom is filtered as well now
185540	when the backside of the case we have
186590	another tempered glass panel but this
188120	one is a little bit different as you can
189709	see there's a whole whack ton of in win
192290	logos on this this was done with the
194659	intention of hiding the cables because
197180	there's no panels or covers or anything
199310	to hide your cable mess but it's not
202040	very effective at this point in time it
203780	doesn't actually really hide them at all
205459	there is apparently plans in place to
208310	change how the logos are laid out to try
210769	to help hide your cables because with
212720	tempered glass on the back panel you
214069	really need to do something about that
215650	but as this case isn't releasing until
218150	about the end of q2 we aren't able to
220129	see that at this time what is also
222440	revealed back here is the fact that you
224150	can mount up to 12 2 and a half inch
227120	drives or eight two and a half inch
229760	drives and four three and a half inch
231799	drives the three and half inch drives or
233569	two and a half inch drives four of them
235250	would mount down here in the bottom with
236689	these easy to release hard drive cages
238879	and the rest of the two and a half inch
240530	go in a whole bunch of different areas
242500	in terms of front i/o you've got your
244729	power button a reset button 2 USB 3
247400	type-a ports a type C port a headphone a
250609	microphone jack and the up and down vent
253040	switch that we mentioned before this
254989	case is not going to be cheap it's going
258289	to be north of or equal to four hundred
260149	and fifty US dollars but this is in
262219	their more premium line of cases so that
264139	is two
264820	be expected if your wallet can take a
267070	pretty sizable hit it could be an
268810	interesting case to get other than that
270430	its energy too is out they've simplified
272650	a whole bunch of stuff with the new
274030	release there's no longer the server
275830	client settings that you have to set up
277510	just all your systems will work together
279310	it's also able to communicate over more
281830	complicated networks that's energy to
283570	you sooner if you one used to have
284980	problems with back in the past so you
286780	have to worry about that stuff anymore
288070	there's a new UI there's SSL encrypted
290740	connections it's it's much more simple
293350	even able to access your computers
295060	before you've logged into them if you
296920	have all this stuff shared over which is
298990	nice so you can move the stuff over
300430	login from there everything's nice and
302470	good to go if you want to check it out
304270	check it out in the link in the
305140	description all right thanks for
306580	watching this video like it if you liked
307930	it dislike if you disliked it get
308980	subscribed to see probably not CES
312250	content it's probably gonna be near the
313750	end so get subscribed to see maybe like
316210	one or two more videos from CES and then
318700	the rest of just you know our normal
320650	videos if you're tired of CES content be
322870	sure to stay subscribed because it's
324640	almost done I'll see you later
