7280	welcome to my unboxing of the rocket
9660	Cova this is designed in Germany you
12780	know the Germans always make good stuff
16369	anyway so this is an optical gaming
20430	mouse it's featuring ambidextrous design
23130	which means you can use it with your
24840	left or your right hand it has easy
27150	configuration because it is driverless
28800	personally I always prefer driverless
31080	mice because that means that you don't
33180	have to install some bloated application
35070	just to use your mouse you might have to
37230	install some bloated application in
38940	order to actually configure it I haven't
41010	used a rock at most before so this will
42780	be my first one but once you've done
44850	that you go ahead you plug it into any
46620	system from there and it stores all the
48479	settings on the mouse itself so let's
50489	see what they have to say for themselves
51930	customizable light system very cool and
53790	a big fan of customizable light system
55530	you can change the color easy handling
57570	not sure what they mean by that but oh
60559	ok non-slip stabilisation surface ok
63839	driverless configuration we've already
65760	talked about that enhanced optical
67350	sensor they're saying this is a pro
68640	optical sensor grip tech side area and a
71850	v-shape here you can see they allow you
74730	to customise the lights have your mouse
76620	illuminated in your favorite color they
77970	show a whole little rainbow they're very
79680	very cool alright moving around to the
81570	other side great packaging I love the
83160	way they do their packaging coppa is the
86550	part of the rock at SM s DM s organize
90060	your gaming zone in a space-saving in a
92370	neat way as part of the smart desktop
93990	management system the coppa integrates
95940	perfectly with the gaming peripherals on
97620	your desktop alright then let's open it
102870	up so I have my handy dandy unboxing
105930	knife here which I will use to open the
108420	handy dandy box slice and slice 5 plus 2
114840	buttons is another thing that they
116370	mentioned on the top of the box here
118380	that is not mentioned elsewhere and that
120390	it is ultralight personally I always
124049	used to prefer a bit of a heavier Mouse
126750	but then I moved over to using an atari
129959	laser for my daily driver and that is a
132930	very light Mouse as well and I have now
134909	been converted to preferring a light
137430	Mouse so
138180	who knows this one might be quite
140489	appealing to me all right why don't we
143579	show the included accessories first and
146099	we'll have a look at the Cova itself so
150000	yes must stand for accessory actually
153629	probably not well we're all very good
157200	packaging though here's a quick
159000	installation guide important document
162560	camera man's fussing up in us right now
165170	all right
166470	change light effects so you can change
168450	the lights here oh oh and interesting Oh
172590	neat okay hold on hold on okay so
174030	connect to the computer switch hand mode
175859	so you can change by pressing four and
178799	six so these two side buttons while you
182400	plug it in you can change from right to
183989	left handed mode that's smart cool you
185760	don't actually have to go into any kind
187590	of driver any kind of software
191040	application okay
192030	neat so here's all the standard
194220	configurations for a right-handed mode
196260	alright you press four and six while
198450	it's plugged in to set the light effect
200099	to breathing fault or no illumination so
202919	you just press those together and you
204660	can change the lighting mode very cool
206190	all right you can change the DPI using
208769	these buttons right here so the one on
210389	this side and the one on this side
212010	that's a very smart place to have the
213569	dpi change because normally they're
215549	located somewhere like kind of here on
217349	the mouse and that's very challenging to
219629	reach that in the middle of a game like
221099	if the theory is that you're using
222540	different dpi for sniping or for
225109	standard play and you're changing on the
227400	fly
228030	then you need a located somewhere much
229979	more convenient than that so having it
231540	somewhere like on the side where you can
233310	zoom in change your dpi zoom out change
236310	your dpi very very convenient change the
239849	breathing mode you can set the breathing
242010	mode to change color after one two or
243750	three breaths or holding the color after
245549	each breath by pressing these two
247409	buttons together and you can change your
249060	color by pressing these buttons together
252169	change breathing mode change color so
254370	let's have a look at the mouse itself
255750	it's got your standard USB cord on it
258029	nothing really to say about that it's
260760	got a little rock hat logo there on the
262560	end of the USB okay so here's the Cova
265380	branding we've got very very grippy
268380	rubber surface
269960	here you can actually hear it squeak
274040	there you go
275460	on the left side as well as the right
278100	side of the mouse so that allows you to
279930	hold the mouse quite securely all right
282360	so I would say this is more of a claw or
284760	or like more of a claw or fingertip grip
288630	style Mouse it's not really suitable for
290730	palming because it is quite small you've
292710	got a great scroll wheel here so it can
294960	be because of its shape it can be easily
296820	used with the right hand or with the
299790	left hand because you see how it has
301260	that that Ridge in the center so that
304020	means that you at the angle that you
305970	would naturally be using it is very flat
307890	whereas most mice most wheels are
309780	actually flat on the top and it's an
311400	unnatural angle to to come at it from oK
314820	we've got more lighting effects here as
316530	well as here your standard left and
318990	right mouse click buttons are here in
320610	here and then at the bottom we find the
322800	pro optic sensor so why don't we go
324270	ahead and go plug it in give me just a
326070	moment here guys so here's the lighting
328740	effects guys you can see I have it on
330480	breathing mode right now you can see the
333840	red light at the back the red lights on
335970	the top you can change the color by
338070	clicking like this just as they say
340200	always up the breathing mode one hold on
342150	let me see oh yeah I think that's the
344370	breathing mode one ok so I think this
347100	must be the color change one there we go
348600	there's green change it again there's
354150	other more different green there's blue
357800	there's other more different blue let's
362130	see what else we got here purple does it
364290	have other more different purple so it
366030	goes back to blue red very cool so the
370590	lighting is that easy to customize I
372900	would say this is my favorite the dark
374190	green very nice color and/or that one
381419	actually that one's really good too that
382650	dark blue so there you go that is my
384540	unboxing of the rocket OVA don't forget
386669	to subscribe to Linus tech tips from
387810	unboxings reviews and other computer
389400	videos while cameraman and I were
393330	putting the Cova back in the box we
395490	found a very interesting thing that we
398550	missed during the unboxing so here's a
400229	little story about a reindeer race
401910	getting out of
402569	control and then you go and on day one
405599	you find a lake and then on v2 you have
409499	some scuba divers and some technicians
411179	and on day three there's some kind of a
413490	surveillance project exploring a
416009	subsurface glacier on day four it's like
418800	like an ops secret ops journal or
421439	something they intercept some email a
422939	correspondence good job that sounds
425009	really interesting please handle this
426749	issue without attracting too much
428159	attention that the personnel file and
433080	then I guess we take out the personnel
435749	guy who here's our contact person and
439529	then there's some analysis and the
441059	rocket laboratories and finally you can
444059	join the organization you're prepared to
445559	come a Rocketeer so I have no idea what
448229	that's for but it includes an ID card so
451860	there you go
