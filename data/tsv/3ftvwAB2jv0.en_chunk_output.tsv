30	so we're not exactly fully moved into
2490	the new office but videos must roll so
5370	let's check out the Logitech G 29
8039	driving force by the way like the video
10950	if you're a huge fan of five-gallon
13170	buckets there just you can use them for
15480	so many things they're awesome
26390	fishhooks is the super simple invoicing
28890	solution that lets you get organized
30419	save time and get paid faster click now
33239	to try it for free
35030	the g29 driving force doesn't look a ton
38579	different compared to a g27 or g25 for
41160	that matter other than the buttons on
42690	the steering wheel and that's fair
44640	because well that's about it but it will
49320	come on to that again closer to the
51239	conclusion for now let's just focus on
53040	the g20 9 for internal hardware the g20
55949	9 steering wheel has dual force feedback
58050	motors anti backlash single reduction
60690	helical gearing automatic calibration
62940	all that kind of stuff which actually
64830	the calibration at least looks really
66780	badass when you first plug it in it has
68610	900 degrees of overall rotation and a
70560	Hall effect sensor the force feedback
73050	feature takes in-game conditions and
75450	transfers them to the wheel so that you
77399	feel more like you're actually in the
78960	vehicle that you're driving for instance
80490	I was playing project cars and did a
82649	bunch of career cart racing I had a
84899	tendency to cut corners a little bit too
86910	close and it was very apparent when two
89130	of my wheels would run up onto the curb
90930	because the steering would change very
93570	cool the dual feedback motor was also
96119	pretty fantastic
97110	it was nice to have it fight with me as
99299	I would try to drag my cart around a
100979	corner at a way to high speed when the
103049	game was giving me red arrows all over
104460	the place speaking of fighting with it
107040	while doing so my hands were
108540	surprisingly comfortable Logitech claims
110970	that they constructed the g20 9 with
113130	materials that were selected for long
114869	term durability precision and comfort
117180	and especially that last one comfort was
119969	apparent pretty quick the leather
121500	wrapped around the steering wheel feels
122700	great we talked about precision
124200	components earlier and in terms of
126210	durability they do have anodized
128190	aluminum through the steering wheel
129600	which is great although the rest of the
131340	body is mostly plastic but that being
133860	said that's probably fine as the only
136620	other things that you're directly
137579	interacting with are usually metal or
140040	leather moving down to the pedals which
141989	feature throttle brake and clutch which
144630	a lot of other solutions kind of skip
146400	out on you have metal plates for each
148859	pedal and then a whole lack ton of
150690	plastic which again is probably fine I
153390	don't know of many people having issues
155010	with the g27 pedals and the overall
157080	design of these is
158790	more or less the same the pedals are all
160439	self calibrating and the brake pedal is
162870	nonlinear in order to mimic a
164430	pressure-sensitive brake system for more
166379	responsive feel you can make adjustments
168930	to the pedals to move them left or right
170790	by small amounts by using a 2.5
173730	millimeter hex key which can help people
175709	with big or small feet just fine-tune
178170	things to themselves moving back up to
180180	the steering wheel we have the controls
181650	all these can be macro set into pretty
183959	much whatever you want but most games
185370	will have some sort of profile that the
186900	logitech gaming software included with
188909	the steering wheel will pick up on and
190620	set up for you you can change things
192480	within the software or say force profile
195299	override so that the wheel will act the
197159	exact same way in every game that you
198720	try it in overall this software was
200579	intuitive and very easy to use in
202470	addition to your standard PlayStation
204419	buttons you have a plus and minus
206370	buttons a dial and an Enter key which
208349	will most often be unused in a lot of
210840	different games default profiles leaving
212430	it up to you to bind additional options
213989	to this and behind the steering wheel
215879	there's your left and right paddle
217109	shifters and up on top you have a
218790	PlayStation 3 or Playstation 4 selector
220950	switch by the way for pc select
222900	playstation 4 on the bottom of the
224639	steering wheel there are cable routing
226169	holes for whatever accessories you may
228180	have and there are arms that can grab
230400	onto most desk surfaces and hold it in
232319	place the metals have an optional mini
234870	plastic spike thing that can drop out
236970	and grab onto the carpet in order for it
238769	to not slide around as much if you're an
240810	advanced user and have a gaming cockpit
242909	like the oboe tow which you can see
244319	Lynas review here there is standard kind
247739	of threaded bolt holes on both the
249479	bottom of the steering wheel and the
250799	pedal mount using this thing was pretty
252479	great it didn't automatically work in
254370	every game that I tried but it picked up
256199	in project cars immediately and it was a
258839	lot of fun to play with a good feeling
260789	comfortable steering wheel with a fair
262530	amount of force feedback Logitech has
264510	done a really good job with their
265830	profiles in game detection was a breeze
268349	when it worked my only gripe was that I
270780	couldn't get dirt or grid to to detect
273630	the wheel at all but that made me more
276240	their fault than maje decks if you can I
278340	would definitely recommend mounting both
279810	of these units to something pretty solid
281550	overall it was fine but there were a few
283169	times where I would react to something a
285300	little strongly and either caused the
287430	pedal unit to slide out or tilted the
289469	whole steering unit not 100% ideal but
292710	not bad for something that took me about
294210	two minutes to set up in conclusion this
296190	thing was a ton of fun but to jump back
298140	to the beginning of the video for a
299790	second it's a lot like the g27 and at a
303000	suggestive retail price of 399 u.s.
305430	dollars I think would be hard-pressed to
307410	actually recommend someone replace
309150	they're still perfectly fine g27 with
311490	this thing unless they need it for
313170	compatibility reasons the price is
315090	pretty steep and definitely the main
316710	detracting feature of this product and
318510	it's getting into the level of competing
320370	with some extremely high-end racing
322860	wheels with some pretty intense features
324690	from other brands so let me know what
327090	you guys think in the comments down
328140	below
