30	it's not often that I come into a video
2100	with this little preparation one of our
4470	writers read a tweet somewhere and
6680	insisted that we check out the
9690	double-oh-seven natural born player I am
13799	so certain that they do not have
15960	permission to use that logo right there
25350	[Music]
28160	synergy allows you to share your mouse
30960	and keyboard between multiple computers
33870	at once check it out now at the link in
36239	the video description natural-born
39030	player from company oh this is why you
44850	wants to check it out so the new writers
47010	name is James but I always refer to him
49590	as that donkey behind his back so the
52559	brand is James donkey and that don't
56010	keep it so the double-oh-seven comes
59309	with this schematic manual thing we'll
62160	check that out in more depth later it
63780	comes with a okay so there's enough
68250	English on this for me to understand
69810	that it is indeed a warranty card but
72479	not enough for me to have any idea what
74580	the rest of these instructions are
75990	where's the Ascended nothing nothing
79290	like that do you get the impression they
81810	added like this huge thing of cardboard
86610	here to make it seem like more premium
90030	than it is Packaging feels a lot cheaper
93659	now anyway and then this this is the big
98850	stick with the double-oh-seven mouth
101220	it comes with swappable parts for the
103710	back right left and even the bottom
107670	apparently look well maybe we need the
110729	instructions so I guess this thing is
113430	kind of like the IKEA of mice and that
115259	the instructions aren't particularly
116640	descriptive I mean they're okay
118439	take the thing off and put the thing on
120420	got it and in that there is some
122729	assembly required guarded so it actually
125640	comes with a variety of different
128580	options for everything from the base
131220	chassis of the mouse to the
133650	left-right and buttock of the mouse so
136829	let's start then by having a look at the
138720	base so you got two different ones
140489	this guy has plastic slip you tagged
143099	four of them and this guy what area has
147930	three metal ones I can't imagine any
150209	reason that you would want metal pads on
153180	the bottom of your mouth and I also
156359	can't imagine any reason that you would
158010	want a country in corrosion
160970	wow that is Brody what happened there
164690	anyway
165900	the piece is snap-on as though by can I
171629	do it can I do the base top gaming mouse
177659	trick shot this is the behind-the-scenes
180420	stuff that you never see in a dude
181920	perfect video yeah yeah and then
186780	everyone celebrates everyone's
188370	celebrating silently come on make some
189810	noise all right so we've switched to the
194489	metal based or whatever let's try the
196170	metal base now let's have a look at our
198209	other options so for the left wing like
201180	I was like hockey we got the left wing
202980	the right wing and the well I think they
205829	call them defenseman in hockey but but
207690	the rear the rear okay so three
209699	different lengths you've got the long
211019	rear you got the medium-sized rear and
213209	you got the tight rear I'm going to go
214680	with the tight rear because I think we
216389	can all tell that that's that's that's
218940	what I'm into so let's go ahead and
220919	throw that on there then this is cool so
224579	these all go on with magnets as well you
227040	can pick between so and have a look here
231560	okay neat so I see how this works so
234030	you've got three different sizes of kind
237449	of like your your thumb your thumb scoop
240060	here you see that so we got the baby
242400	bear we got the momma bear and we got
244829	the papa bear so I'm actually going to
247680	go with so mama bear because I like the
250290	idea of having a sniper button over here
252769	even if I don't need like a massive
255569	thumb rest it should be noted though the
257010	papa bear actually also has the sniper
259529	button in a different location if you
261000	prefer to press it here but I find that
263010	quite a bit more awkward
264880	- okay our assembly is nearly complete
268150	we've got the right wing and these ones
270190	have the coolest names this one right
272380	here is general then we've got Oh and
280140	finally see you know what they say hold
287320	my finger wow this is really confusing
295060	to configure for gear adjustable dpi
300100	among six hundred one thousand two
302470	thousand thirty six hundred eighty two
303880	hundred that's five then making matters
310030	worse configuration light the quantity
314500	of the light represents six different
317440	modes is it four five or six I still
322450	haven't figured out exactly how these
324130	buttons work but I've done it at five
325630	hundred dpi that feels pretty good I
327550	have one more complaint and that is that
330010	this scale doesn't make any sense
332620	it goes up to eighty two hundred sixty
335470	five hundred seven thousand seventy five
337720	hundred but what seven seventy six
340570	hundred what is this maybe some gaming
347380	will make me feel better and of course
349300	the game is shut down now yes why is it
354820	doing first time setup we had this open
356320	before you know the funny thing is these
358600	instructions actually looked okay at
361450	first glance but now I'm getting to some
364470	really crappy stuff I mean it's healthy
367090	to refer to the driver settings but it
368770	doesn't come with anything in the box
370420	I even download these
373990	oh this is not a good sign
379300	James donkey calm doesn't have any
382780	English
383500	oh wait here we go here we go here we go
385949	English sight oh man I mean that's sort
392169	of English you deduce the fingertips of
395229	walls what so we've got two straight
400840	product shots three then we've got not
405009	English
405789	then we've got that okay you know what
408280	that's fine the MOU double-oh-seven here
412599	we go oh God when you try and
416380	scroll down the page it's a slide show
421320	why who thought this is a good idea on
426669	round switches though very nice
428979	20 million click like I'm pretty sure
430780	they're only talking about these two
432220	them download driver and support more
435009	self-definition function I needed more
437590	self definition in my life so we got the
439870	software working we got the firmware
441430	updated and check this out wait what
445860	that works a second ok the contact there
451330	is not great
452199	ok I'm sort of figuring some things out
456780	there's more cool stuff in here I think
459659	so there's a vibration switch there's a
464169	vibration time and then there's a boot
467289	time start vibration effect I don't know
470680	what that means
471719	ok we think we figured it out in order
477190	to get vibration working you have to
479139	give up your RGB lighting because that's
482620	why this one's heavier there we go
485880	alright that's actually kind of
488050	uncomfortable but you know hey whatever
490389	you into you hear that
494409	if the idea was like recoil or something
499310	that I will tell you the experience
500599	Falls a little flat it feels like a
504139	happy Mouse happy mouse in your hand
506810	it's actually kind of distracting and
508969	annoying
510069	wait it's not working anymore there I
515539	think it better to vibrate itself amused
522039	now they're awful okay so we've got the
525290	software mostly figured out vibration
527360	only works with the vibrating bass RGB
529730	lighting only works with the RGB
531230	lighting bass and the mode so I still
536029	can't figure out how these configs work
537980	you click on them it takes you back to
539690	the sign-in you go back to here and it's
542899	an endless loop there's no there's no
544490	option to create config but that's the
546740	difference between the modes and the DPI
549410	button the modes are onboard
551410	programmable memory for all of this crap
553880	is at least my understanding i cannot
556910	validate that so now let's go ahead and
560449	try again
562010	Eady oh good kai for you this mouse has
567920	given me a horrible headache I need you
569750	to tell me if it's any good
570949	oh go go go go go go ahead oh okay wait
576860	now you're now you're into it right look
582529	hmm interesting
584600	and it like it's not tied into the game
586699	that would be cool if it was tied into
588079	the game like it's my shots or actually
591019	my goodness I suppose instead of just
593570	like pressing
595960	Thanks reading yeah now it feels - this
600070	is like a terribly terribly cheap
602670	implementation for force-feedback but
605860	like fine
609210	alright thank you okay but and
612010	subjectivity aside let's find out if
614800	this thing is any good so the first
616930	thing we need to do is move ten
618610	centimetres Hey
620470	so the DPI we set is correct a thousand
624040	dpi then we can test to see what its
628089	maximum max counter and max speed are by
632290	basically moving it as fast as you can
636130	oh I got like Drock burn on my finger
646230	shiny okay so max speed is four meters
650950	per seconds and Max counters 376 points
654610	with a polling rate of about 500 Hertz
657450	okay resolution okay speed excellent so
662680	I think we're ready for the overall
664209	conclusion at the regular price which is
667330	around 50 bucks for the light one I
669310	think there's better options out there
671980	from the likes of Logitech you don't get
674290	all of the sort of modular doodads and
677290	vibration motors and stuff like that but
679000	quite frankly most of it feels pretty
681670	gimmicky however if you're willing to
684100	settle for one of the other color ones
685690	at like $25.00 in terms of the raw
690010	performance of this thing it's not bad
692860	if you don't mind a mouse that's on the
694959	heavier side and that is also a little
697900	bit on the larger side it's too big for
699670	my hands but given that mine are well
701980	below average I suspect most of you will
703870	probably be fine synergy is a software
708490	download that solves the ultimate first
711279	world problem of having too many
713860	computers and having a desk that's
716440	covered in keyboards and mice to control
718450	them it allows you to share one mouse
721209	and keyboard between two or more
723850	computers so you'll never get confused
725770	which one is which and which one goes to
728140	what one they offer a
729790	basic and pro option with a one-time
732190	payment for lifetime access and features
734470	include things like clipboard sharing
735820	drag and dropping files between the
737860	computers the ability to set up hotkeys
739840	and more you can even use synergy
742390	cross-platform between Windows Mac and
744670	even Linux so check out our link in the
