0	after months of delays and tens of
2879	millions of devices shipped by their
4920	competitors Apple's late entrant to the
7529	home smart speaker game has finally
10530	arrived but can it possibly compete with
13559	the Google home max I speak her twice
16320	sighs armed with the almighty Google
18810	assistant yes but it's also a little
22830	more complicated than that
25540	[Music]
31130	Kable mod pro series cables use extra
34170	thick wires for a fuller more robust
36390	look merged terminals on the component
38880	side of each cable have also been
40050	eliminated for a cleaner build check
41850	them out below
42630	despite some people's observations that
44880	it looks kind of like a giant toilet
46620	paper roll subjectively I would still
49410	say that the home pod wins on the design
51989	front the seamless 3d mesh fabric looks
54570	great from any angle though I would
56520	recommend washing your hands before you
58080	touch it the capacitive glass top is an
60570	elegant haptic and visual interface
63000	displaying volume buttons when you're
64800	playing music and a beautiful listening
66750	animation when you're talking to Siri
68310	and we even found the physical interface
70770	more pleasing to use tapping or holding
73920	volume buttons feels more intuitive than
76020	the slide gesture you have to do on the
77700	Google home Macs and it's nice to be
80400	able to Hale Siri without using your
82650	voice a feature that Google removed from
85320	all of its home devices wrong now the
87840	home pod is small but don't let that
90510	fool you it's much heavier than it looks
92820	at five-and-a-half pounds and this is
95070	thanks to the incredible amount of
96869	hardware that Apple packed inside it
98939	it's got a four inch subwoofer at the
100890	top six microphones around the middle
103439	and seven tweeters at the bottom and not
106950	just regular tweeters these are really
108990	cool for one thing they are horn loaded
111810	which allows them to more efficiently
113430	turn mechanical energy into acoustic
115740	energy increasing their effective
117689	radiating area and making them sound
119640	bigger than they are
120600	and for another their diaphragms are
123390	balanced mode radiators meaning that
126270	they can produce high frequencies by
128190	rippling or low frequencies by moving
131310	the diaphragm in and out the
133200	old-fashioned way so if the home pod
135540	senses that the bass demands will make
137520	the subwoofer distort it will actually
139350	offload work to the tweeters and there
142980	is more to this technology than just
145830	using good speakers both home pod and
149190	Google home Mac's use special low
151830	frequency calibration microphones to
154470	give themselves spatial awareness this
157319	functionality does allow these devices
159480	to map the room around them and then
161940	apply automatic bass correction
163980	to increase clarity now Apple said in
166680	their keynote that the home pod would
168420	direct certain musical assets like the
170849	main vocals to the center of the room
172739	and ambient sounds and backup vocals to
175709	the side which is really good news
177690	because otherwise an omnidirectional
180410	wired speaker would not be ideal a lot
184860	of the time so I guess it's all of that
187860	stuff combined that made this thing take
190319	so darn long and also what allow the
194250	home pod to avoid distortion even when
196860	it's turned way up so the rumors are
199920	true it sounds really really good
202910	especially for its size but what about
206849	the elephant in the room the Google home
209730	max from our evaluation it actually
212790	sounded just as good but with a
216150	different sound signature while the home
218819	pod has pronounced mids and highs that
221069	are very forward max offers a wider
223920	soundstage with deeper chest-bumping
226500	bass thanks no doubt to its dual four
229620	and a half inch high excursion
230849	subwoofers although this is interesting
233730	while max gets significantly louder
236489	before it starts to compromise on sound
238859	quality at lower volumes the home pod
241889	can actually deliver surprisingly strong
244290	and pleasing bass compared to the max do
247620	we think to its ability to transfer
250169	sound down into the surface its resting
252720	on okay then so they both sound great
255780	but these aren't just speakers they're
259108	smart speakers which brings us to the
261329	next question we have to answer which
263729	one is smarter while both assistants
267870	offer the usual fair-weather stock
270660	prices news we were disappointed to
274110	learn that unlike her competitors Siri
277110	on home pod doesn't search the web so
280770	while she can rely on native API hooks
282930	to answer questions like who is the
285210	president of Friends the answer I found
287490	is Emmanuel macron
289100	at this time she stumbles on novel
292490	queries like how long is the average
295070	ferret I can't get the answer to that on
297500	home pawed ferret typically has a length
300080	of 15 inches
301040	it's very geebo of you Siri sad although
305360	your mileage may vary since some people
307760	have reported it working but while
310070	that's a clear disadvantage today the
312590	two devices are about equal when it
314630	comes to response time latency and their
317390	ability to hear your commands over loud
319820	music
321630	and home pod does have one awesome
325020	feature that Google home doesn't have
326730	yet Siri send a text message what do you
330780	want to say with that said home pod does
333900	not have voice recognition profiles like
336720	Google home does so in theory anyone
339570	could ask your home pod to read out your
341220	last text message whenever they want
343380	I found your most recent message from
345180	Edsel hey fire buns last night was
348210	amazing
348690	speaking of privacy while both devices
351090	allow you to turn off the microphones
352860	Max is the only one that lets you do it
355230	with a physical switch so which one
358650	should you buy then we actually think
361320	the answer is pretty simple and comes
363360	down to whether or not you use Apple
365070	music see with a Google home or Amazon
368970	echo you can use all the major music
371280	platforms Spotify Google play music
373260	Pandora iHeartRadio you pretty much name
375630	it including Apple music and the same
378930	goes for the home pod so why did we
382050	bring that up ah because it's how you
385230	can interact with those services that
388020	makes all the difference here with
390240	Google or Amazon solution you get full
393300	voice control with everything but Apple
396570	music which is limited to next song and
398940	pause with the Google assistant and even
401610	then only if you are casting your entire
403890	device via bluetooth by contrast the
407490	home pod does feature voice control with
410010	Apple music but only Apple music so if
414030	you're using Spotify the only way to
416460	control it even if you have an iPhone
419520	will be through the buttons on your
421170	device and there's some more general
425120	inflexibility like we've come to expect
427560	from Apple unlike the Macs the home pod
430230	does not include a three-and-a-half
432120	millimeter jack for third-party speakers
434190	and it requires an iOS 11 device for its
438660	initial setup
439590	that's right Android users and even
442380	those of you with older iOS devices you
445350	will need to go buy an iPod touch on
447450	Craigslist to get your home pod working
450200	well mostly working which brings us then
453750	to the features that Apple
455220	promised that aren't out yet and won't
457710	be until airplay two launches later on
460140	this year one the ability to connect
462870	multiple home pods in stereo and to
465950	multi room playback from airplay to
468660	devices be they home pods or Apple TVs
471240	or whatever Mac's
473460	can do both of these things today so
476450	then that answer wasn't so simple after
479430	all but it's okay I have a summary if
482430	you don't have any wooden tables and
484920	you're already deep into Apple's
487470	ecosystem with an apple music
489150	subscription and a bunch of money sunk
491130	into iTunes home pod is a beautiful
494280	piece of hardware and a fantastic
496560	speaker but if you are almost literally
501270	anybody else you're probably better off
504630	with a competitive offering like a
506730	Google home Macs and a ly XA enabled
509490	Sonos or even some regular dumb speakers
513150	plugged in to an echo dot hey Siri tell
517679	me a joke
519620	[Music]
521089	well this whole experience wasn't very
524159	funny at all this has been quite the
526080	project so far yeah I know hey Siri read
530280	out my last text message
532110	I found your most recent message from
533850	Edsel hey fire buns last night was
