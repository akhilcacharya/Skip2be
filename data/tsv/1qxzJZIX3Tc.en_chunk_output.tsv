30	okay so today I'll be unboxing kind of a
2669	different product I don't do many sort
4680	of okay I guess we've done those pads in
7080	the past fine this is the pure track
8910	talent and basically they are saying
10980	that this is pretty much the best
12660	mousing surface ever okay so they're
15660	saying it's a super soft cloth service
17340	used by top professional gamers and they
19590	have a couple of a couple of gaming
22170	brands on here that they support so
24269	they're saying they support complexity
25650	gaming calm as well as lowland lion's
28410	calm okay so what they're saying is
30420	unique about this particular product it
32910	is really thick so that that means that
35309	you have a flat surface regardless of
36930	whether your table is actually
38100	completely flat they're also saying that
40680	the printing on the top of the pier
43680	track talent is conducive to precise
47550	tracking with laser and optical mice so
50640	why don't we get this thing open here
52680	and find out what we see inside so if
55230	you can see the talent coiled up here as
57840	well as what appears to be some
59250	documentation inside okay so what do we
62640	got we have a printed sheet free
65880	Ventrilo for 30 days whatever you can
69180	use the code whoever watches first
70619	there's your free Ventrilo for 30 days
72390	code no contracts no hidden fees no
74700	small text okay with this offer you'll
76320	get free 10 user accounts blah blah blah
77700	okay that's kind of cool so that comes
79409	with the pure track talent mousepad I
81780	see something else in here - oh okay so
83850	you've got a peer track sticker that you
86189	can stick to your stuff whatever it is
88530	that you have okay so then all that's
90869	left is to take out the mousepad itself
93900	and hopefully I'll have some time to do
95670	some in the notations here with my
97470	impressions I use an Akari and laser
99540	mouse for my gaming so wow this thing is
102689	huge okay so that is quite a large
105420	mousing surface and the first thing I
107820	noticed about it
108720	and this is something I think is really
110369	smart is check out the shape okay check
112860	out the aspect ratio so to speak this is
115590	a widescreen mousepad most of the other
118020	mouse pads on the market are actually
120329	four to three just like an old-school
122549	monitor whereas this looks
124610	more like a sixteen to ten sort of
126890	aspect ratio so it means that rather
129050	than having a mousepad where your mouth
131120	you're going to track side to side and
132680	up and down and you're going to need way
134000	more you're going to be closer to the
135470	edges on the sides this one you're
137660	actually going to be able to use the
139130	whole surface just like you can track on
142100	your screen okay so it's about the same
143900	size as a 24 inch monitor so that's
146570	actually pretty smart so the thickness
149030	itself is another thing that they are
151850	really saying is important about this is
153410	the closed cell sort of rubber foam so
155840	it's not gonna be going anywhere once
157190	you put it down on your you know there's
159020	not a whole lot to say about a mousepad
160310	hopefully the annotations give you some
162140	idea I want you to have a quick look at
164090	the surface it feels like you're gonna
165800	glide quite easily it's a very fine
167720	cloth weave and they're saying that this
170000	pattern that they printed here will give
171890	very consistent tracking actually that's
173570	one of the dumbest things that I think
174920	is mousepads better for gaming that have
178820	complex graphics on them because as soon
180410	as you pass over a dark black to white
182630	transition or certain other color
184280	changes you're tracking just fails on a
187040	laser or an optical mouse so I'll have a
189350	look at this thank you for checking out
190670	my unboxing of the deer track talent
