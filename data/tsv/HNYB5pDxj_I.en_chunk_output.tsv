199	today we have a product that it seems
3210	like everyone and their dog is excited
5790	about this is a mechanical keyboard from
8580	racer this is the Black Widow ultimate
10889	and it is a self-described mechanical
14759	gaming keyboard for gamers by gamers it
17550	has a mechanical key architecture for
19380	superior tactility and faster response
22529	okay this has fully programmable keys
25260	with on-the-fly and macro recording five
27720	additional gaming keys with individually
29550	backlit keys so you can see the whole
31230	keyboard is actually backlit and let's
34320	move around to the side see what it has
36540	to say for itself
37710	35 Meg's of free hard disk space PC with
40469	USB ports ok so these are pretty pretty
42690	tame system requirements we'll move
45270	along to oh I want to show you guys this
46920	so this is razors classification of this
49110	particular keyboard this is in their
51180	elite series ah so it's one step up from
54510	expert 2 steps up from essential so it
56969	is definitely not essential to have a
58859	keyboard like this but it is certainly
60600	elite alright so individually backlit
63180	keys 10 customizable software profiles
65400	with on-the-fly switching easy access
68130	media keys which we'll show you in a
69659	minute earphone out and microphone in
71549	Jack's built into the keyboard fully
74040	programmable keys 5 plus additional
75479	Cayman keys mechanical key okay so these
77939	are gaming optimized key matrix for
80909	minimized ghosting okay you know what if
84330	someone can leave a comment on the video
85560	and tell me exactly what they mean like
87090	that by that that would be fantastic
89520	ok English so 100 ultra pulling so one
93420	millisecond response time 50 G's 50
96509	grams of actuation force required for
98460	the keys so if you're into mechanical
100110	keyboards you probably have some context
101820	for that Mori pizza stuff we've seen
104579	already and here we go tactile tap
108090	feedback when actuated optimize
110850	actuation force of 50 grams rapid key
113820	snap back after keystroke execution and
116460	a lifespan of up to 50 million
118409	keystrokes so there is the benefits of a
120479	mechanical keyboard in a nutshell so
124369	let's break the seal on this guy and
127469	have a look at what all the fuss is
129209	about
134340	all right razor is pretty much the
141310	packaging experts and you look at this
143890	video we got green on the inside of the
145450	box and I always enjoy opening up their
150640	boxes because they've always kinda they
153160	always throw something new at me so the
155320	first thing we see here this is quite
156700	obvious is we should take this out okay
158650	all right okay I guess that gives us
160510	access to something okay take it out
167610	well it's not their best work I've seen
169750	better I think their finest was the the
172180	Mamba Mamba had just a phenomenal
174580	package but the presentation is still
178660	quite slick you know you've got your
180700	overall completely black superior on the
184660	packaging which always makes everything
186310	look higher performance because everyone
189700	knows if it's you know you paint it
191770	black it goes faster and all that good
193660	stuff all right here we go
197980	so here's the package for gamers by
199750	gamers razors uncom here we go black
204010	widow ultimate welcome to the cult of
206050	razor here is a certificate of
209170	authenticity next you have a Quick Start
211630	Guide which probably involves
213190	instructions like plug the USB port into
216160	the computer or plug the USB cable into
219489	the port okay here's a master guide
221459	probably a number of languages in here
223600	yes there are okay we have a couple of
226030	Razer stickers and I believe these are
227800	UV reactive last time I checked which is
230260	pretty cool as well as the Razer product
232180	catalog if you like this one then you
234190	can check out some of their other stuff
235830	alright so that's it for included
238390	accessories does not come with one of
240850	these fortunately what a brat okay now
245650	let's check out the keyword itself which
247510	I have been quite anxious to have a look
251080	at
251690	so first let's see the impedance cables
255080	to pull this plastic sleeve I can do
261260	that do not cut tape like that at home
267670	right now do this okay here we go
272000	so the included cables are two USB so
274940	that's probably going to be one for the
276290	built-in hub yes there we go so there's
278540	port and then that one's labeled Razer
280910	and then we have a microphone jack as
283520	well as a headphone jack so that's for
285170	the pass-throughs that are coming up
287990	through the keyboard which I will have
290300	to find at some point okay and it's not
294320	a hub it's just a single port but we'll
296120	get to that later so here are your
297680	programmable achieved five of them over
299660	here alright here are all of your
302060	backlit keys so you can clearly see the
304130	part that is backlit because it's a
306560	slightly different color from anything
307880	that's drawn directly on the key so for
309830	example this character is not backlit
312590	whereas this one is up here same thing
315320	f7 is backlit but this media key thing
318500	is not here's all of your media controls
321530	built into the F keys up here now this
324710	is an interesting choice you know what
326210	here conveniently I have a steel series
328760	7g which we can use as a side to side
331960	comparison with the Black Widow since
334520	that was kind of the the reigning
336620	mechanical gaming keyboard okay so the
339500	razor keyboard adds a few things over
342140	the 7g so you got the backlit keys which
345200	is huge purse I personally think that's
347030	enormous
347780	you've got the programmable gaming Keys
349880	which I also think is a huge advantage
351980	and then let's have a look at what is
355430	different between these two so first of
357740	all I like the layout of the razer
359120	keyboard better because of one simple
361280	thing and that's best full-size
364880	backspace key they haven't done anything
366560	goofy with the layout of the keyboard
368180	you've got a full-size shift you've got
370700	a full-size shift you've got a full-size
372530	backspace key and a and a lot and a wide
375800	enter so that I like right off the bat
378860	here's one that I think is kind of a
380510	funny decision though because you look
382100	both SteelSeries
383350	and Razer have included one function key
386110	instead of a Windows key so SteelSeries
388120	put stairs here and the function key is
390130	for accessing the media controls and
391960	whatnot
392530	whereas razer has decided to leave the
395740	windows key here right next to all of
398080	your gaming keys strange decision and
400660	put their function key here so that's
404020	the one thing that I'm probably question
405850	about the layout although when I'm
407170	typing and really mechanical keyboards
410320	are made for typing I mean most
413710	keyboards are made for typing but they
415000	really are so when you're typing I'd
417790	take that longer backspace over the mix
420910	placement of the Windows key any day now
423520	you can hear that the keystrokes are
425050	quite different between the 7g and the
427270	black widdow so I want the camera to get
429070	really close and just listen so you can
434470	really hear distinct click to the key on
436930	the Black Widow ultimate and then I want
438730	you guys to listen to the 7g so you
443260	don't really have that that click so
445090	just because there's one mechanical key
447370	switch and another mechanical key switch
449140	doesn't mean they're identical it's
450820	worthwhile doing a little bit of
452140	research and as I always tell anyone
455710	buying a keyboard you should always find
457540	some way to test drive it before you
459670	actually purchase it I like the finish
461650	of the Black Widow although I don't know
464680	how fingerprint proof it's going to be
466840	but that's just pretty much something
468820	that if you're if you're used to running
470410	razor for referrals you're probably
472060	already used to you've got a couple of
474040	little legs back here for our tilting
475810	the keyboard up should you so desire and
477460	then if you don't have those up you've
479260	also got one two three four five rubber
482410	pads on the bottom of it to keep it from
484180	slipping on this side you find nothing
486220	of note same goes for the back and then
489160	on the other side that's where you find
490750	the USB port so that there's a single
492730	path report so I'm gonna go ahead and
494290	assume hopefully I'm not wrong that it
496360	is USB 2.0 which is personally I'd take
499450	that over a USB 1.1 hub which we find in
502210	most keyboards any day and then we've
504430	also got our pass-through for the
505810	microphone as well as the headphone jack
507970	so thank you for checking out my
509680	unboxing of the
510879	ultimate don't forget to subscribe to
