30	so this year at CES the RGB craze was in
3810	full swing two years ago with keyboards
6180	last year was motherboards this year if
8670	you could hold it down long enough to
11099	slap an LED on it it was our GB memory
14599	SSDs I'm someone's probably making RGB
17340	cables at this point but the thing about
19980	the RGB craze is that it's very
21779	polarizing some people love it and some
23910	people hate it which got me thinking
26490	what if there was some way that we could
29099	tastefully improve RGB products so that
33140	nobody could dislike them and then it
35910	came to me warbly if you haven't seen
50219	nerd sports yet check it out all the
53070	episodes are available now for free over
55379	at youtube.com slash Channel super fun
58350	so for those of you watch the intro or
61260	wondering what that smell is that thing
63780	I've got the answer for you it is the
68210	mechanical keyboard with LED backlight
72110	made in China though the manufacturer
75570	seems to be a little bit confused
77130	because this is clearly not a keyboard
80250	what it actually is is a set of key caps
82640	for a mechanical keyboard so we're going
86040	to have to go to the Amazon page to get
88380	a little bit more detail here ah here we
90840	go okay so it's the e element PV T
93630	double shot injection T cat set and it's
96689	available in the gold I showed you
98100	already or and yes we bought both of
100619	them this Falaschi silver set and I
105119	gotta say I was pretty impressed
107100	I mean P bTW these are good quality key
110939	caps at least on the surface you haven't
112740	opened the box yet and as long as you
114840	can get over the aesthetic for a full
116610	set 25 bucks that's a pretty good value
119009	but of course like fine wine
122460	if you don't pair it with the right food
124229	then you're just getting wasted in your
126240	sister's basement complaining about
128160	whatever it is that's hard in your life
129479	so we needed to find ourselves a
131280	keyboard and this one from G scale looks
133140	like a pretty good
133900	sit this is the cam 570 it's got Cherry
135940	MX switches in this case Browns because
137799	yeah jobs we're going for brown switches
139900	it's got RGB backlighting on each key
142840	individually and you can customize the
144489	lighting effects and all of that stuff
145989	oh yeah did I mention these key caps do
148510	have windows so they have lighting
151569	pass-through for the letters and finally
154000	it features a completely bog-standard
157500	layout which is not great if you like
161620	something customized about your keyboard
163900	experience like macro keys or like oh I
167410	don't know I can't think of too many
168879	things that I actually like changed
170769	about my keyboard so if you really like
172359	short shifts or something like that then
175090	it's not great for that but it is good
177220	for being able to buy cheap key cap
180129	replacement sets and have some hope of
182799	them actually fitting okay so all that's
185530	left now then is to open one of these
187599	bad boys up really nice and we we still
193180	have to choose which one gold or silver
195790	so you guys let me know in the comments
198310	below which one you want me to put on
200380	quick we've got five seconds go vote who
207250	are we kidding
207790	there's no way to vote this is live all
210099	right let's go ahead and open up the
213040	gold one here I realize I'm risking
214739	accidentally flashing our dbrand skinned
217329	gold backgrounds but I don't think we've
220180	ever been tempted to use it before
221709	anyway so I'm not going to trust you oh
224530	wow this would have been a lot better to
227160	keep in the plastic and I would have
230290	been able to travel even faster yep
233129	don't get too mad at me for cutting
235060	towards myself you realize that yes I am
238000	under the knife but a source is being
240160	applied in this direction see now I'm
243430	cutting towards myself
246760	totally different okay here we go
256790	[Music]
268680	and we're done
272270	here that sound that's the sound of an
275820	upgraded keyboard now there are a few
278820	things we still need I overlooked that
281550	this keyboard does actually have four
283949	extra keys in the top right but I had a
286770	brilliant idea at least I think it was
288600	brilliant I'm going to grab the arrow
290699	keys from the silver one and add just a
294509	little bit more flick so mute can be
297900	volume down that's right
300889	volume down can be left arrow which is
305280	here oh yes volume up can be right arrow
312110	is here no which is here yes and memory
320099	because this keyboard is programmable
321750	can be this bad boy right here volume up
325949	listen I got said before ok the last two
328410	things we're going to need then are a
330509	keyboard or a computer to plug this bad
333300	boy into and this cloth which you'll be
336389	keeping next to your keyboard from now
339060	until forever if you want it to retain
341550	its gorgeous like new shine there we go
346500	my lute this time it won't be people oh
354680	it's awful if that is not the world's
360630	most amazing keyboard I really and truly
365849	do not know what is holy crap
372270	oh man that's what's let's get it let's
375270	get it all dark and intimate in here oh
378169	ok well now it's just completely dark ok
381000	with that
382139	how's that
383710	ok so now we've got the software
385630	installed and we'll have some footage
387280	overlay of all the different profiles
389050	you can do you can do solid colors
391300	they've got some different effects
393400	there's like a raining effect ripple
395350	effect wave effect all kinds of good
398229	stuff and you know what's the most
400389	amazing part of all this is all this
402910	this can be yours for less than a
406449	hundred dollars how long it'll laugh
408759	that we don't know theoretically
410830	double-shot keycaps last pretty much
413229	forever but what I noticed is that well
415930	let loose notice he's actually our chief
417580	teacup expert is that the thin foil
421210	coating over the top is actually not
423310	that durable so it might not last for
426250	that long but it'll look amazing in the
429430	mean time actually Luke come on over
430690	here fun perfect other other than the
434259	scratches I actually don't think that
436419	they could have made that it was enough
438250	and the fact that they made this as a
439780	light comes through impeccable they're
443560	being completely sarcastic yeah I
446080	actually hate it those are absolutely
447760	the worst looking key test I've ever
449380	seen a must I okay okay eggs they are
452320	amazing okay so there you have it have
456220	we achieved our goal of making RGB less
459580	polarizing no no we have not but we had
465099	an awful lot of fun doing it so today
