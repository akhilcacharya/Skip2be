930	this video at CES 2018 create an awesome
3389	website or an online store using their
5400	all-in-one platform today go to
6960	squarespace.com slash LTTE and get
9269	started
9990	speaking of get started an all-in-one we
12660	are with the zotac and magnus this is
15660	their new version doesn't have a name
17190	specifically yet but it is known for
19619	coming with an 8th gen processor that
22260	means six cores and up to 4.6 bigger
25050	Hertz stock which is awesome and it has
28109	a 1080 mini inside as well so no
29849	compromises in terms of performance now
32729	in terms of memory you have two ddr4
34800	slots for up to 32 gigs of ram one m2
37559	slot for a drive and one two and a half
40860	inch slot for another drive if you want
43050	that as well alongside an obtain memory
46020	slot which you can all fill yourself
47820	once you get the bare-bones kit now the
49829	Magnus chassis if you've seen it before
51510	is probably familiar they didn't
53100	recreate the wheel here but on the front
55230	in terms of i/o you have one large
57120	illuminated power button an SD card slot
59699	one USB 3.1 type a port and one USB 3.1
64199	type C port along with headphone and
66360	microphone jacks on the back you have
68460	four USB 3.0 ports two ethernet jacks
71369	which is really cool one power in for
73650	the external power brick and a
75720	Kensington lock along with your GPU
77670	outputs which is three display ports one
79979	HDMI and one DVI pretty cool to see a
82950	high performance 6 core 8th gen Intel
85950	processor running at 4.6 freaking
88080	gigahertz and a 1080 in a little box
90600	that's similar to the size of some
92759	people's external GPU boxes that is
94710	pretty sweet but moving on from there if
97530	you're not that into gaming or need a
99240	small form-factor PC for workstation use
102210	they now have you covered this is that I
104490	believe the world's first mini PC with
107189	Quadros built in so we have the p1000
110280	p3000 and p 5000 their closures here are
113460	not final features so some of these
115649	aren't exactly how they're gonna look in
117149	the end but they scale up each one the
120020	p1000 has an i5 7300 you the p3000 has
123899	an i5 7500 T and the P 5000 has an i5
128179	7500 T and then there Quadros go up from
131250	there as well
132180	but that part is produced
133690	forward because the namesake for the
136000	workstation mini goes along with its
137950	Quadro model so if the first one the
139630	p1000 has a Quadro p1000 with four
142510	gigabytes of gddr5 the next one the
145110	p3000 has a Quadro p3000 with six
148090	gigabytes of gddr5 and VP 5000 has a
152050	Quadro P 5000 with 16 gigabytes of gddr5
156550	on chip that's crazy in terms of storage
160570	you have one m2 Drive slot one two and a
163120	half inch drive slot and two slots for
165280	it up to 32 gigabytes of RAM make it a
