30	oh hey guys just casually gaming with
12870	the purchase of a qualifying Intel
14429	processor SSD or nook you could
16440	instantly win and Intel gaming Jersey
18240	and be entered in the draw for the
19680	ultimate system click now to learn more
21600	the first and most important thing about
23550	this MOS is the optical sensor featuring
25769	Logitech's Delta zero and fusion engine
28740	I'll get into exactly what the fusion
30660	engine does in a moment but first I want
32880	to test their Delta 0 feature which
35010	basically means no cursor acceleration
36899	as I have some pretty seriously deeply
39239	rooted trust issues when it comes to
41100	most manufacturers and their claims
43200	about acceleration a quick and dirty
45450	explanation of most acceleration is this
47670	if you disable it moving your mouse from
49620	point A to B along a surface without
51840	acceleration should result in the cursor
54239	on your screen moving exactly relative
55890	to the movement of your mouse
56940	independent of the speed of which the
59309	mouse is moving if you were to start at
61770	a move halfway to be extremely quickly
63989	shake the mouse around for a little
65549	while and then go extremely slowly to B
67979	it would still land on B if you enable
70890	acceleration moving extremely quickly
72299	the same distance on the mouse pad will
74460	cause your cursor to overshoot B's
76020	position on the screen and then
77790	repeating the same movement but very
79170	slowly will cause the cursor to fall
81210	short of B's position this is fine for
83310	average users who want to move their
84990	mouse very slowly when trying to click
86430	on something more precisely but it's not
88530	as I Belong precision of their muscle
91170	movements to translate directly to the
92970	screen without any janky randomness it
95220	seems like this is a non-issue
96720	since aside from gaming mouse drivers
98220	windows allows pointer acceleration to
100049	be disabled and stuff that many modern
102060	gaming mouse sensors have inherent
103950	acceleration that cannot be turned off
106020	so to come anxiety we tested g4 o2
109229	sensors by grabbing our camera slider
110880	and just doing a few modifications I
112829	replaced the traditional soft stopper
114899	method with dual heavy-duty clamps to
117000	reduce travel when the slider bumped
118500	into them I then put the slider on the
120689	table and lowered it pretty much as far
122130	as it could go
122909	using a velcro strip to secure the mouse
124829	to the bottom of the slider then for
127020	measurement I put a grid overlay on my
128580	monitor
129090	after all this setup I tested it with a
131459	variety of movements and I'm happy to
133470	say that as far as I can tell the G 402
135720	features what is known as a perfect
138420	sensor with no inherent acceleration
140940	kudos logitech next up is the fusion
143760	engine i was talking about earlier
145020	logitech is using a gyro and an
147090	accelerometer to augment their already
149160	awesome optical sensor if you're running
151410	at a low dpi setting and need to whip
153210	your mouse insanely fast in order to
154830	pull that super-sick 360 no-scope at the
156930	end of your mega dope montage video it
159000	is technically possible for you to
160500	outpace an optical sensor if you do
162930	manage to outpace the optical sensor it
164640	can potentially cause the cursor to
166320	judder or even drastically jump around
168240	which is bad with the fusion engine and
171480	the gyrometer and accelerometer we'll
173910	try to fill the holes in the data stream
175650	to avoid this to test this out linus and
178140	i had a contest of sorts where we
179610	battled to see who could whip the most
181350	the fastest in terms of IPS or inches
183660	per second - one - his extensive master
186650	badminton skills which he has honed over
189420	many years of extremely vigorous
191190	training so it works as advertised kudos
193890	again but even though it worked
195450	I left Logitech sensor modeling 2 on for
197430	a night of gaming and just tried to
198900	ignore it and play normally to see what
201090	would happen it seems that I never
202980	actually exceeded 84 IPS which means
205560	this feature is unlikely to ever
206910	actually kick in for me but I'm not a
209280	professional gamer if you're a low
210900	sensitivity gamer and you do end up
213030	purchasing the g4 o2 and you find that
214980	you get into the speeds where the fusion
216450	engine really benefits you please
218580	message me on Twitter or some other
220050	medium as I'd love to hear more about
221700	your experience which brings us to the
223560	software setting the 240 to 4000 dpi
226650	sensors multiple sensitivity levels was
228600	easy enough and it allowed for a fairly
230400	specific setting as it was able to
231989	increase in increments of 80 you can
234390	also set your polling rate to 125 250
236850	500 or even 1000 reports per second
239280	after getting all that technical stuff
240780	out of the way you can have fun with the
242130	right side of your brain by playing with
243870	the customizable lighting they're able
245640	to set brightness level change the speed
247410	or disable breathing mode entirely and
249840	change the deep if dpi lighting is
252180	always on or just illuminated when you
254220	are changing things and last but not
255870	least is turning off the lighting
257488	effects when you haven't used your mouse
258630	for a specific amount of time Andy for
260760	those of us who have our computers in
262470	our rooms so that was fun but now it's
264750	time for real-world use of
266880	in terms of shape feel and ergonomics of
269340	the unit when compared to the g502 is
271410	futuristic alien-looking aesthetic the G
273570	402 is definitely more conservative but
276030	still does have some Flair it's rocking
278610	eight buttons including forward back dpi
280710	up dpi down dpi shift left click right
282900	click at middle click and they can be
284400	programmed to execute various functions
286290	keystrokes or even multi key macros
288450	using Logitech software so basically
290610	even if you're one of those guys who's
291960	religiously against dpi shift buttons
294000	you can set that button to anything from
296040	play next song functionality to spamming
298320	kappa kappa kapppa or raise your doggers
300030	in chat unfortunately though scroll up
302820	and scroll down were not included in the
304740	key binding options after all that we're
306990	left with a few takeaways when compared
308760	to the G 500 to the G 402 is definitely
310800	a bit more conservative it's down to 8
313260	buttons from 11 it doesn't have a
315060	free-spinning or tilting scroll wheel it
317670	doesn't have a customizable weighting
319110	system it lacks some of the nicely
321270	textured soft touch rubber gripping the
323550	light isn't quite as bright it doesn't
325920	have a braided cable the swooped out
327720	part for your thumb isn't nearly as
328950	accommodating and the left and right
330780	click don't feel quite as sharp and
332700	responsive as the g502 but they still
335220	have a 20 million click rating which is
337200	nice but hold on now that's actually not
339360	that bad on one hand you have the G 502
341820	with its beautiful sensor and laundry
343230	list of features on the other hand you
344910	have the G 402 with the different but
346860	still beautiful sensor which is armed
348510	and armed with a powerful but possibly
350820	not needed for everyone at least fusion
353280	engine while the G 402 is laundry list
355530	of features is considerably shorter than
357960	the g502 it still feels great in hand I
360360	mean you still have the fundamental
362190	organ on that quality of a Logitech
364050	mouse which to many people myself
365580	included feels great in your hand and
368400	you've got one other thing in your hand
370290	that feels great 220 bucks
373530	the G 402 is $60 compared to the G 502 s
376470	$80 price tag so that's a lot of most
378540	for your money and the review is pretty
380490	much over but I have one more closing
382950	thought thank you Logitech for working
385020	on meaningful performance metrics
386520	instead of just focusing on dpi which
388920	many people are just going to lower
390480	anyways
391350	they've even have their dpi blasted on
393360	the front of the box and it's clear
395070	they're more focused on things like
396180	their Delta zero and fusion engine
398220	technologies
399130	I'm tired of seeing companies dump
400960	high-end flawed mice year after year and
404800	it's nice to see a shift in focus
406530	speaking of a shift in focus today's
408580	video is sponsored by gigabyte horas x7v
410800	to gaming notebook this is the thin and
413200	light SLI gaming notebook that we
414670	compared against a not so thin and light
416770	notebook in the video and the annotation
418300	here with two geforce 860 MS in sli and
421630	Intel i7 48 60 HQ processor a 17.3 inch
425890	1080p display a one terabyte hard drive
427990	and a few different options for SSD and
429640	ram capacities all packed into chassis
431980	that's less than 0.8 inches tall is an
434500	absolute beast that you can pack in your
435970	backpack without breaking your back as a
438340	surprisingly good keyboard solid heat
440440	dissipation from its rear exhaust setup
442090	and more than acceptable noise levels
443920	for a thin notebook all which make the
445990	gigabyte or s x7v to an ideal product
448270	for someone looking for a notebook
449350	that's suitable for everyday use as well
451630	as gaming so if you're in the market for
453310	a gaming notebook be sure to check out
454960	pricing and availability for the x7 v2
457000	using the link in the video description
458230	I know what you guys think about their
460540	delta0 and fusion core technologies as
462970	long as what do you guys think about our
464680	testing methodologies for stuff like
466150	acceleration also if you would like to
468790	save money getting the 402 or if you're
470830	more kind of into the baller style
472450	status of the g502 let me know all that
474760	kind of stuff in the comments down below
475840	where you should also be liking
478120	disliking subscribing sharing and
479920	otherwise distributing this video and if
482560	you want to post somewhere else because
484060	you're kind of not into YouTube jump
485950	over to the forum post there and let me
487480	know what you think there if you don't
488860	like the ads on the forum become a
490060	contributor and as always thank you guys
492190	for watching I'll see you next time
