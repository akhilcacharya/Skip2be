7160	today I'll be doing an unboxing of the
9740	Sudoku wireless 3d mouse keyboard so
13670	this is a company that's based in Taiwan
15380	they're calling this the air keyboard
17330	let's have a look at what else they have
18890	to say about themselves it is ok beyond
21200	limitation easy installation good
23150	Wireless light plug-and-play
25460	ok interesting let's see what else we
28099	got here same kind of stuff operating
30500	voltage 2 to 3 volts 2 double-a
32238	batteries is what powers it it supports
34550	pretty much every OS under the Sun
36739	including Linux look at that and
38239	interesting effective range of up to 10
40400	meters hotkeys for controlling Windows
42080	multimedia functions motion sensing air
45020	mouths now that is cool left and right
48110	mouse buttons so here we go let's go
51680	ahead a little screwdriver here cuz I
54950	lost my unboxing name yet again yeah
57500	let's open this thing up and have a look
59690	it actually looks pretty cool based on
62079	my analysis at the outside packaging but
65479	remains to be seen how good the product
68060	looks so it comes with a couple double-a
69710	energizer batteries very nice
71899	those don't expire until 2017 so those
75229	will last you a little while ok and then
78530	we have the oh that's a clever way to
81979	store the dongle look at that so the
83450	dongle plugs into a dummy USB port on
86329	the back for storage and then you just
89030	unplug that plug it into your USB port
91280	and off you go it's plug-and-play the
94789	battery is installed here as well as
97609	here so the weight of the unit should be
100009	pretty even to the left and the right
101600	and let's have a look at the overall
103880	layout of it so you've got a full QWERTY
106159	keyboard layout yeah almost everything
108679	no compromise is being made here so all
111020	the number keys the tab you've got all
114979	your letters you've got like your
116959	brackets and your backslash and your
119450	semicolon your posture fee so you can
122560	you can actually type let's let's have a
125209	look ok
131480	personally I would have preferred if the
134489	letters were a little bit more centered
136170	on the layout because when I find myself
137730	doing is gravitating towards here as
142170	kind of my home row spots when actually
143909	they're more like sort of here so it's a
147120	bit of a reach for my right hand so yeah
151920	the spacing is it feels a little funny
153930	but I think you'd get used to that
155280	without too much difficulty now it's got
157620	a space key that actually has three
160530	points under it I can feel three
162060	distinct switches down there so what's
163950	nice is that means if you hit it with
165000	your left hand or your right hand you're
166349	still going to get it to register okay
169680	your backspace key here you got your
171239	delete you got your calculator search my
174150	computer email and internet hotkeys then
178139	you also have media keys mute volume
179909	down volume up stop back for word pause
182579	play and skip as well as a hmm most
187109	pointer key and a Windows key now you
189150	can use the mouse like this or you've
191670	got interesting so alright you know
196079	either the option of the air using these
198060	as an air mouse or you can move the
199769	pointer around this way there's your
201209	middle click there's your left and
202739	there's a right click I'm gonna have to
203879	try this as an air mouse to see how it
205230	goes though so the air mouse actually
209099	works surprisingly well so check out the
213720	computer screen basically I'm going to
215909	lean forward a little bit so you can
216930	kind of see what I'm doing but all I
218519	have to do is aim it around kind of like
220769	a laser pointer at the screen and I can
224220	move the mouse cursor around now in
225720	terms of accuracy let's go ahead so I
229079	can double left-click using the shoulder
230879	button here and don't ask me again I can
234840	go here and I can go to youtube.com
241729	and my cat is drinking my water can you
246659	believe this oh my internet connection
251609	is down okay give me a sec guys
252810	sorry about that guys okay I got my
254699	internet working now so we're gonna go
256349	ahead go to youtube.com there we go so
259289	I'm going to tie
259959	I don't know liest
265060	whoops tips I turn when I can find oh
271569	channel nice to cave so it looks like a
273370	good channel it's gonna maximize the
276069	window here scroll down so the accuracy
278229	is actually good enough for me to sit
280630	here and and use my computer as I
285639	normally would see pesky oscillating
287979	video so there you go that is the air
