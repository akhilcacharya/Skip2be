30	the accepted wisdom for a long time has
2520	been that if you want a truly enthusiast
5220	class typing or gaming experience you
8010	need a mechanical keyboard and with
11130	features like superior build quality
13160	satisfying tactile feedback and quicker
16350	response times perhaps there was only
18900	one thing that could actually have made
21750	them even better
22949	and that would be freakin laser be

44720	learn more at the link in the video
46340	description optical key switches like
49280	the ones that we are looking at today
50600	promise extremely quick response times
53629	and shorter actuation distances than
56300	popular mechanical key switches from
58040	manufacturers like cherry but for some
61489	reason they remain a niche item the fact
64040	that the big boys of current keyboard
66110	manufacturing like Corsair and Logitech
68630	haven't picked them up yet probably
71330	isn't helping so we turned to bloody
74300	Tesoro and wu ting the only three
76729	companies we could find that are
78710	currently incorporating them into their
80509	keyboards to see if this technology has
82670	a bright future let's start with a quick
85100	look at how they work currently there
87020	are two main types of optical switches
89300	one uses a plunger that blocks a beam of
92450	light and when the key is pressed a gap
94490	in the plunger moves down and allows the
97070	light beam to hit a sensor that
99140	registers a key press two of our
101539	keyboards the bloody B 720 and the
104000	Tesoro Excalibur se spectrum use this
107450	process with the bloody switches branded
110149	as a light strike abbreviated as LK for
114950	some reason well the Tesoro uses
117140	swappable switches from gator on Gator
120050	on guitar on either way both keyboards
123380	incorporate waterproofing as well a nice
125179	value for you mountain dew fanatics the
127580	second main type flare tech instead uses
130429	an upwards firing beam to determine how
132650	far downward the key has been pressed
134980	meaning instead of simply registering a
138050	key as pressed or not the keyboard can
141980	instead register a partial key press
144739	similar to how an analog trigger on a
147680	game controller can be pushed only
150349	partway down to accelerate a little bit
152840	more slowly than a full press in a
155330	driving game so our third keyboard the
157970	wu-tang one is available with these
160310	flare tech switches in two flavors red
163069	linear switches or
164940	Lu clicky ones which are user swappable
167520	and we'll start with a closer look at
169560	this one
170250	routing actually markets this granular
172560	level of input sensitivity control as
174860	analog which is not technically correct
177990	because the keyboard is really just
179850	registering one of 256 distinct states
183210	of pushed down this but for the sake of
185820	helping users understand the tech we see
188790	why they did this and in practice the
190920	action is very smooth I doubt that most
193290	users would actually even be able to
195180	notice the difference let's demonstrate
197190	how this works with Forza 3 here you can
199860	see how pushing down the keys that are
202440	mapped to the steering wheel only
204420	partway results in a much more gradual
207630	turn while a gentler throttle press also
210750	allows finer control of our acceleration
212490	neat huh you'll also find a surprising
215760	amount of customizability in Wootton one
217710	software package which is called and no
220140	do not adjust your headphones you heard
222180	me right root ility not only can you
225210	remap keys to functionality like
227340	triggers on a gamepad but you can set up
229980	multiple analog profiles with different
232560	sensitivity curves since you might want
235140	the keys to react differently depending
237420	on whether you're piloting a tank in
240180	battlefield or controlling a soccer
242190	player / footballer in fifa something to
246330	note is that this analog functionality
248459	doesn't actually kick in until after the
251310	two millimeter actuation distance which
253620	is similar to most Cherry MX switches so
256620	while looting is looking into the
258480	ability to build a hair-trigger capable
261238	version in the future for now the
263970	utility can only be used to make the
266130	actuation distance longer if you prefer
269250	less sensitivity in something like a
271710	turn-based game or if you're just typing
274950	and of course all this additional
277440	functionality doesn't mean the wu-tang 1
279540	is automatically the best option in
281940	every scenario let's move on to the
284790	bloody be 720 its LK switches lack the
288419	fancy analog functionality but it boasts
291210	a very short actuation distance of 1.5
294860	millimeters the shortest of any of the
297660	keyboards in our
298560	roundup to see if there's a tangible
300630	benefit we had our resident csgo wizard
303389	Etzel test out each of the keyboards and
306210	while he didn't feel that the routing or
308820	Tesoro were appreciably different from
311340	common Cherry MX Reds he really liked
314430	the quick response of the bloody saying
317340	that while the difference wasn't huge it
320760	definitely was noticeable kind of like
323400	going from a 144 to a 240 Hertz monitor
327300	in his words and we didn't even tell him
330030	the actuation point specs before he
332520	tried it out so give bloody some credit
334620	here there claimed to have the world's
336600	fastest key response might just be true
340080	at least when comparing to other optical
342270	solutions the MX speeds claim a slightly
345270	shorter actuation distance at one point
348150	two millimeters and although Edsel
350460	didn't think this made a difference in
352410	game responsiveness he did think the LK
355470	switches were a bit heavier so keep that
358290	in mind if you use a light touch on your
361050	keyboard and this leads us into our
363330	impressions of overall build quality and
365669	usability in our opinion the whoo ting
368340	one walked away the clear winner in this
370500	department its deck is quite rigid which
373020	often indicates a well-made keyboard and
375300	it's understated brushed finish and
377400	subtle logo at the bottom gives a
379289	higher-end appearance not to mention I
381810	really liked how this thing felt under
384120	my fingers it was soft but in a good way
386850	kind of like typing on boobs for
388800	whatever it's worth and then when you
390150	use the clicky switches it was sharp and
392280	satisfying the bloody with its giant
395639	blood-soaked logo on the other hand
398280	practically screams we tried to make
400979	this look as gamer as possible at any
403620	cost and the keys felt a bit mushy for
406830	my liking though edy didn't seem to mind
408750	so that's something to note and the
410669	build quality overall seemed solid if
412760	unexceptional unfortunately I can't say
415770	the same about the Tesoro I was able to
418050	twist the keyboard way too much even
419880	with a minimal amount of torque maybe
422010	that's what they meant by break the
423720	rules at $92 it isn't a bad piece of
427289	hardware it just simply doesn't do
429240	anything better than the other two
431340	the
431820	money however presents an interesting
433260	alternative to MX speed switches thanks
435960	to its very competitive price of 75
438720	bucks us the routing one is by far the
442140	most interesting one we checked out
444480	today possessing a unique feature set
446970	with solid build quality and customized
449790	ability but I would probably only shell
452790	out the 160 euros it will cost you if
457170	the games you play specifically benefit
459900	from their pseudo analogue functionality
461970	or if you want a typing experience that
464310	matches your tacky mouse mat if you were
468240	to go get tunneled there right now you
470790	could actually have it turned on and
472410	working by the time I finish telling you
474510	why it's awesome it is that simple to
477120	use you basically press one button and
479460	boom your connection is secured and your
482790	online activity is kept private from
485250	your internet provider advertisers and
488070	the websites that you use and of course
491010	there's the added benefit of being able
493140	to select any country you want so you
495450	can use websites and online services
497850	like streaming video players as though
500700	you are from a different country tunnel
504060	there has a top rated privacy policy and
506640	does not log your activity and you can
509370	even try it for free to experience what
512880	a more open Internet might be like with
515820	500 megabytes of data with no credit
518580	card required and then once you choose
521220	to get a year of unlimited data you can
523409	save 10% on that by going to tunnel bear
526200	comm /l tt thanks for watching guys this
530550	video sucked you know what to do because
531780	awesome get subscribed to the like
533280	button hit the bell if you want to
534720	incessantly see every single video we
536940	ever released your phone and your
538350	desktop and everything it's a good way
540150	to keep track of everything we're doing
542100	if you want to see stuff to buy check
543810	her the link in the video description
544590	there's an Amazon link down there and
546240	there's also a merch store link for some
548490	cool shirts that aren't this one anyway
552180	yeah check out this video which is
555800	seeing the first video I ever made which
559110	was on my own and it never got uploaded
560850	anywhere and it was on a ducky keyboard
562770	from like way back my mom filled it
565320	filmed it on a flip HD camera in our
567750	kitchen at the time see you later
