0	okay today I have a limited edition qck
2850	mousepad this is a zara tool versus
5850	kerrigan starcraft 2 themed mousepad so
8760	just like the regular qck this is a
11639	flexible cloth pad and steelseries qck
15240	has been around forever as far as I can
18119	tell I mean why mess with what isn't
21119	broken but I just wanted to have a look
22980	at it because while there's nothing
24689	particularly new they're bringing to the
26880	table in terms of the the clapham aus
29279	pad gaming experience oh actually oh
32668	okay nevermind i thought i was going to
34559	say oh it's actually quite a bit stiffer
36690	than normal but actually that's just a
39230	paper backing so yes the qck is its
42719	normal flexible self it's quite a thin
45180	mousepad the actual dimensions of this
47520	particular one are 12.6 by 11 point 2
50430	inches so you can see the way that
52079	they've applied the graphics to it you
54059	still got the full texture of the fabric
56550	itself and you know what the thing about
59309	steelseries graphic most pads is that in
61649	my experience they work just as well as
64349	the plain black ones which is quite an
66000	achievement because usually if you print
68460	a graphic on a mousepad what happens is
70979	as the laser or the optical sensor
73460	crosses a sharp contrasting patch like
77850	let's say you you were to cross through
80159	all of these legs so you have like a
81869	dark and then a light blue and then
83640	you've got dark and then light blue you
85320	tend to see the mouse sensor jumping but
88740	with all of the steelseries ones that
90420	I've used in the past they do not
92460	experience that problem in cameraman
94170	actually uses a SteelSeries 5c so that
97829	was a limited edition wrath of the lich
99540	king pad every day and he's even with
102329	extensive use with several mice never
104759	encountered that kind of a problem so
106350	anyway this is part of their limited
107729	edition starcraft two wings of liberty
110040	mousepad theory and i'm just showing you
112649	this one because i think it is by a long
114750	shot like by a long shot the coolest
118390	and I guess that's pretty much
119860	everything I wanted to say it comes with
121420	a little steelseries sticker it comes
123220	with
125770	steelseries catalog
131200	you
