30	there are all sorts of keyboards on the
2429	market today from elaborate gaming
4980	platforms to sleek utilitarian designs
8340	but what about a keyboard for the
10889	discerning gentleman the kind of
13920	keyboard that says my other car is a
16590	semi-rigid dirigible
18570	well don't pop a monocle but a while
21420	back a tech enthusiast by the name of
23580	jacket Silk'n created an open-source
26340	project detailing how you can convert
29189	one of the several antique typewriters
31439	you no doubt have cluttering up your
33600	boudoir into a perfectly functional USB
36719	keyboard and we're going to show you
38670	just how to do it old bean

49980	Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
52899	makes it easy to browse privately and
55059	enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
57640	bear for free check out the link in the
59320	video description to start with let's do
62289	a brief primer on how a typewriter
64360	operates every key press you'll notice
68680	there extremely deep results in a
70840	mechanical action involving Springs and
73270	levers that causes the arm corresponding
76149	to the struck letter to make contact
78220	with an ink ribbon and stamp the letter
81069	on to the page as you type in theory the
84970	contact point for each letter is
86819	identical and it's the page itself that
89619	moves back and forth more on this later
92880	so this should be pretty simple then
95229	thanks to the enduring QWERTY standard
98560	there's a convenient backwards
100630	compatibility of sorts so we could just
102850	take the existing letter stamps put
105850	contacts where they strike and add some
108039	kind of digital interface and boom it's
109689	off to the races right well no back to
113470	the point before about all the arms
115239	hitting the same spot every key on the
118090	keyboard would hit the same spot typing
121090	the same letter over and over so you
123759	only look like a badass until someone
126340	started reading your screenplay over
128050	your shoulder in the local Starbucks so
130840	the way to get around this while
132610	preserving the original aesthetic and as
135160	much of the original feel as possible is
138489	with this the sensor bar it consists of
142540	a series of flexible metal contacts laid
145090	out like piano keys across a circuit
147310	board that intercept the input directly
150849	under the keys themselves
152409	so each actuation drops a corresponding
156370	bar in this row which strikes a contact
159519	and alerts the microcontroller to a key
161769	press cool right let's show you how to
164620	do it before we can install the sensor
167110	bar we need to displace the space bar
169780	for access and then remove the cross bar
172239	now ideally the way you're supposed to
175569	do this is by unscrewing the two stops
178690	on the space bar and loosen
180920	the screw so the spacebar can swing out
183500	of your way unfortunately thanks to mr.
186440	rust our screws are all stuck fast you
189800	can try to solve this by applying a
191900	liberal dose of hydrogen peroxide and a
194060	few firm taps to let the liquid seep
197420	into the thread which worked for one of
199370	the screws we needed but even after more
201470	taps than fred astaire second best pair
203660	of shoes the screws on the spacebar
205820	stops and the ones holding the crossbar
208070	in place remained firmly jammed
210230	so naturally we gave up I'm just kidding
214030	fortunately we have the skills and tools
217010	appropriate for this sort of delicate
219019	operation success with unimpeded access
223100	our next step is to remove the layer of
225980	paint on the bottom of the keys to
227840	expose the electrically conductive metal
230300	underneath a lot of people would
232790	recommend using a coarse grit sandpaper
234890	to strip that away but what am i a
237350	monkey banging rocks together that would
239540	take way too long I'm going to use a
241340	machine now we're supposed to move the
243950	crossbar at this point so we can
245780	repurpose it into a holder for the
248060	sensor bar but with the amount of
250100	corrosion and rust on this thing it's
253519	not going anywhere
254510	time for more improvisation this chunk
257478	of metal we procured has three qualities
259760	that are crucial to us one it's a flat
262669	surface to it's rigid enough to be used
265550	as a support and three and perhaps most
268280	importantly it was within arm's reach in
270440	our recycling pile so we sliced a thin
272930	strip out of it to hold our sensor board
275260	now though we're gonna need some way to
277970	prop it up beneath the undercarriage ha
281180	glory be these two empty threaded holes
285050	on either side of the typewriter frame
287030	are exactly where we need them to be and
289520	currently woefully underutilized so we
292880	liberated these two eye bolts from some
295430	large clanking machine near our
297110	electrical box I'm about 80% certain
299810	they were structure II superfluous and
301690	they fit perfectly in these slots so all
305210	we need to do then is twist them through
308000	to the right depth a wallah super firm
311479	with barely any give like a
313650	fashionable whalebone corset now it's
316320	crucial at this point to visually check
318630	the alignment of the dots on the back of
321150	the center board with each metal bar
323039	then once we were sure it was perfectly
325620	positioned we glued the center board on
327870	to our makeshift supports better use a
330509	little more just to be sure maybe a
332639	touch more I don't want this going
333840	anywhere and perfect we'll put the
337259	control panel here on the side where
339360	it's close enough to the censor bar for
341250	an easy connection and where we can
343080	easily reach it and we're almost ready
345030	to flip it back over but there are just
346830	a few housekeeping items to take care of
348510	these eye bolts extend way past where we
352050	need them and the scuttlebutt is they
353669	made some disparaging remarks about the
355350	Queen so I'm afraid it's off with their
357449	heads it'd be a shame if we cut the cord
360060	to our control panel though so we're
361530	going to make sure that that's tucked
362820	nicely out of the way and move our space
365010	bar back in position we also need to
368070	attach the control panel directly to the
370590	electrically conductive metal of the
372300	frame with a grounding wire the best and
375599	by best I mean the only one not so
378840	thoroughly rusted that we can actually
380310	remove it screw for this job looks to be
382919	this one in the back now a modern
385650	keyboard has keys that you won't find on
388139	any typewriter ctrl alt and command
391110	being among them you can just press the
393750	control box but the cooler way is to use
396750	magnetic switches on the four auxiliary
399080	inputs that it allows so we set ours up
402690	on the space bar shift and carriage
405479	return which means that when we press
407250	ENTER we get the satisfaction of
409560	slamming this lever every single time
412289	and as any early 20th century typist
414630	will tell you that never gets old
416639	the wires are a little all over the
419130	place at this point but after a quick
421320	round of cable management we are pretty
423840	much done everything looks as tight and
426360	rigid as late-victorian gender norms and
429000	the end result is a piece of hardware
431550	that is more than just another
433560	disposable peripheral but rather an
436560	interesting alchemy of antique and
438960	modern machinery not to mention a
441330	beautiful centerpiece for a desk an
443370	elegant keyboard the blue screen of
445590	death if you type too fast
447330	but it's great if you're interested in a
450300	tactile typing experience that even the
452640	best mechanical keyboards can't match if
454800	you enjoy technology with a unique
457020	aesthetic or if you just want to show up
459630	all the wannabe hipsters at your next
461760	poetry slam we're teaming up with rocket
465510	to give away three of their skelter
467460	keyboards their membrane keyboards that

472290	phone and your PC at the same time so
476340	you type directly to your phone / tablet
478590	and then switch back to your PC with the
481110	touch of a button you can utilize

492720	watching a stream or a video on your
494010	phone you can answer incoming text
495390	messages well that's a phone but don't
497130	worry too much about that without having
