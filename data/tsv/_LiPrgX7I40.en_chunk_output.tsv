6440	welcome to my unboxing of the hoary
8880	fighting edge fight stick which comes in
13920	a black box that spins batteries not a
18449	few spinning requires muscular input
22650	okay let's just go ahead and open this
24539	up have a look this is Ferb as you may
26849	or may not be able to figure out
28050	fighting games right here this one is a
31019	colorful accessory however NCIX carries
34680	them now so hence I am happy to unbox it
40200	and check it out so it comes with a
42300	cleaning cloth which is a bad sign for a
46260	peripheral because if it needs a
48480	cleaning cloth that probably means it's
49890	shiny and or not okay this is a ps3
52469	compatible there is the USB cable that
55620	will run to the PlayStation 3 I'm very
57210	curious to know if it will if it will
59340	detect on a PC it's got a nice long
61320	cable so we're gonna go ahead and plug
63210	it into a PC just for bolts and find out
65369	if it works plug that in there
67700	installing device driver software go
69900	ahead and here look at the screen
70979	let's find out if it works together
73760	fighting edge okay that's a good sign if
76530	it knows what it is installing driver
78119	software that's an excellent sign and
80280	it's ready to use okay so it's ps3 and
82799	pc compatible the cable is about 1 -
90240	iris fan bow 1 and 1 and 3/4 lioness
96720	arms fans so that would make it about to
99240	convert that into something you guys
100590	about 10 feet long
102380	guys like you know I give it a
104909	measurement then you're more comfortable
106020	with
107220	ok so let's figure out how the heck this
109950	works so these come down on here like
113549	this and then this closes up it ok
119149	they're driving me crazy this goes
124010	okay okay okay then this needs to go
128509	here no close this there we go okay so
131750	that's how the cable goes up the back I
133130	don't know if this is for storage
138970	Diesel's given me they like I can't do
143300	it the one eyebrow thing whatever you
144530	get okay so there's a PlayStation button
147470	here there's some other more different
149300	PlayStation buttons here what makes this
151310	one premium is the touchscreen that's
153560	integrated here although it's not
154790	powered on so you're not gonna be able
155930	see anything and then there's a joystick
159170	which presumably is like more better for
162680	butter button mashing and ah very nice
167750	huge huge grippy pads on the bottom
170960	meaning it's not going freakin anywhere
172850	you can see they are optimally laid out
175250	to be placed on your thighs and have it
178970	not slip even if you're at a bit of an
180650	angle on the edge of the chair so it
182360	won't go anywhere you're sitting in
183590	playing video games like this which I'm
185360	sure someone at some point in the past
187490	has done thank you for checking out my
