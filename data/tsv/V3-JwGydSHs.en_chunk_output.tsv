7330	now you guys gave me a really hard time
9830	when i unboxed that that keyboard that
12469	had the built-in iphone dock that you
14510	could make you could use your iphone as
16160	a touchpad and the keyboard or you could
17750	use the keyboard to type on your iphone
19789	well here is a more PC oriented product
23330	it's not expensive compared to the other
26180	one it has a windows logo right on it
28940	has a limited lifetime warranty and this
30800	is for the multimedia pc as well so this
34910	guy has a keyboard and a touch pad built
37969	into it it uses bluetooth it has six
40879	internet hawk he's 14 embedded media
42859	keys and on the back let's see some
44539	other product features here okay six
46819	internet hotkeys and 14 media keys okay
50739	connecting a hot switch between six
52850	toast devices that's interesting all
55219	right what else do we got here operating
56989	distance operating oh wow up to 33 feet
60109	that's not bad that's uh gonna work
62569	pretty much anywhere inside your house
63889	in theory so he stroked life is 10
66200	million all this good stuff you know
67310	what let's just get this baby opened up
68630	because this is from osseo this is
71600	actually which model is this ah ok so
74000	this is the kb 30 37 BP and this is the
78049	kind of product that i would use that i
80659	would quite enjoy we've had stuff like
83119	this on the market for a long time
84890	actually but a lot of it has been cost
87469	prohibitive as you guys pointed out to
89390	me when i unbox that other product that
91549	was like a hundred dollars for what was
93170	essentially a keyboard that had a dock
97789	on it so i do see your point this guy is
101390	quite a bit cheaper and comes with
105890	batteries it's wireless that was the
108619	other problem with the other one is it
109999	wasn't wireless you actually needed
111710	wired power for it so i understand that
114320	complaint as well although i have been
117109	using it and is it it is it is it is
119179	pretty decent for my purposes so let's
121130	plug this guy in here we are that's
126020	pretty much the entire setup process and
128630	let's have a look at the physical
130130	keyboard itself so it's quite light
131540	which is nice because when you're
133100	sitting on the couch you don't feel like
135140	this you got a keyboard on your lap you
136970	don't want some big old heavy thing
138540	it's also actually not this is the
140340	curvature is good as well so you can see
141719	how it goes from flat and it angles down
144599	a little bit to be curved so what that
146069	means is that you are leaning forward a
148799	little bit to type on the keyboard or
151019	like your your hands are like this and
152519	then to use the touchpad you're coming
154799	up like this which is actually very
155970	natural okay so we've got um let me are
160079	those are those touch-sensitive pool so
162900	we've got a bunch of hot keys here we
164819	have all of your usual kinds of media
167159	keys so we've got a play/pause forward
170250	back stop volume up volume down you can
173670	that looks like locking the touchpad so
176250	that's kind of handy as well now in
177900	terms of the key quality it's about what
179519	i would expect is some about what you
181530	would see on an average kind of laptop
184049	so very short travel distance is fairly
186480	quiet so if you're up late watching TV
190829	you're watching youtube videos on your
192299	on your television on your media pc or
193980	whatever the case may be then you're
195780	probably not going to be disturbing
197129	anybody if you're typing on this it is a
199109	bluetooth keyboard so you will need a
200669	receiver I'll bear that in mind you guys
202500	it does not come with a receiver and
206930	yeah I think that's pretty much all
208829	there is to say but one thing that
209849	really stands out to me about it though
211139	is it has a really nice brushed finish
213840	here so it makes it look kind of sharp
216720	because the thing about a media keyboard
218340	is is probably you know if your if your
221190	kids are relatives or anything like the
224010	people that I know you know this is
225780	going to end up just kind of thrown on
227310	the couch after people are done watching
228810	TV and it's going to kind of sit there
230549	so you want it to look pretty decent
231930	rather than just you know being like
234329	some beige thing that doesn't have a
236010	nice finish on it because people are
237840	going to see it when we come over
239069	potentially I think that's pretty much
241650	all there is to say about it why don't
242909	we just get some closer product shots at
244620	this so you guys can see what's involved
247199	in
248220	look yet here's a little instruction
251760	quick important information actually
253520	thanks a lot i tell you about this while
255600	you while you kind of check out the
256950	keyboard here check it out from that
258238	angle so you can i press here to
262950	enable/disable you some sath padta yeah
264510	that is indeed what this does to pair
266520	multiple Bluetooth devices all you have
268740	to do is press and hold the reset button
270210	until the connection led is blinking
271710	than user devices Bluetooth utility in
273630	search and connect to the keyboard so
274950	it's kind of a Bluetooth hub which is
276750	also kind of neat you just press
278340	function and then the number you used
280650	when pairing the device oh cool two pair
286080	two devices 126 that's kind of neat it's
289230	good to read documentation okay next we
292230	have the pairing guide for the keyboard
294330	and then we also have this is actually
296790	really neat it comes with a diagram most
298710	keyboards expect you to just kind of
300240	stumble your way through it so this
302400	gives you a diagram of what all of the
304890	keys here are bound to by default a
306690	pairing guide you've got this reference
308220	sheet okay if you are buying this
310320	product for your parents for example on
312960	my parents sir they're not tech savvy at
315660	all so what I would do is I would take
317490	this guide and I would tape it down
321510	inside the drawer of their TV stand and
324650	then it's there forever so that way if
327570	anyone calls me mmm-hmm the touchpad is
330300	not working and I say okay press the
332460	function all what's the function key
333870	uh-huh the FN key the one that did the
336180	blue one but all the keys are black no
339600	the one with the blue text well there's
341490	a bunch with blue text the one with the
342600	blue tax SS function but it says FN c
345720	i'm trying to diagnose this over the
347190	phone so i don't have the keyboard in
348419	front of me right so i don't have to
350430	explain it all i have to say is hey go
353430	look at the piece of paper i taped it
354750	there for a reason so that's actually
356220	really handy i appreciate that it cost
358320	them almost nothing to print out this
359760	piece of paper but it's very useful and
362490	finally we have a quick start guide
364410	which looks like it covers how to put in
366630	the batteries pretty much all right so
368370	thank you for checking out my unboxing
369750	of this
370600	ticular ezio keyboard the kb 33 7bp
