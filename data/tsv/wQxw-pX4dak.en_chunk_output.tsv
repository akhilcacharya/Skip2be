30	logitech brought us here to switzerland
2040	to check out the g 900 chaos spectrum an
4110	interesting looking mouse but with some
5819	really bold claims especially when
7560	comparing it to a wired mouse which
9630	traditionally would have been a lot
11160	better in like almost every possible
13559	metric they claim however that it has
16170	now reversed s-- they're claiming that
17699	the g 900 is better than a wired mouse
20220	let's do some science and figure it out
30790	so we're starting off the RF labs this
33260	is probably one of the most important
34550	things about this most is its wireless
36890	performance that's what they've been
37940	trumping really really hard this whole
39890	time so we need to benchmark it we're
42080	going to test it with huge amounts of
43910	interference without interference all
45650	this different kind of stuff and see how
46730	it compares to other mice we're going to
48860	do that by coming inside of an anechoic
50809	chamber but this time it's on the
52670	anechoic chamber in terms of sound it's
54470	an anechoic chamber in terms of signals
56390	so RF Wi-Fi bluetooth all that kind of
58340	stuff isn't going to be able to leave
59690	the room once the door is closed and is
61850	gonna be able to come on in to the
63409	inside but to cause that interference we
66290	have this antenna right here which is
67970	going to be shooting out massive amounts
69710	of amplified RF Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
72020	signals what they did was they went to a
73940	land of about 300 people measured the
76640	signal noise and then amplified that by
79190	a little bit more to make a crazy
81049	worst-case scenario over on the other
83240	side the room there's all this foam kind
84950	of stuff everywhere that's so that
86360	signals aren't bouncing around
87799	throughout the room and you just get a
89270	solid trajectory so it's better and more
91490	consistent for measurement here we have
93350	the most rigs so this is a jogger that
95420	keeps a pad moving under the mouse so
97880	that the actual sensor is constantly
100369	firing and sending information which is
101930	important because you need to most be
103070	actually working and then the mouse is
105049	held in place above that across the room
108530	a little bit right here is the receiver
111109	so this guy is actually talking to the
113780	mouse that wire goes through a tube to
115579	the outside and then we're measuring
117310	actually the tracking of the mouse out
119960	there where the actual interesting stuff
121880	is let's check that out so as you can
123619	see back here on the spectrum analyzer
125179	they have a crazy amount of noise being
127909	fired in that room right now but over
130820	here you can see a tracking tester where
133430	it's just tracing the cursor movement of
135260	the mouse as that joggers going around
137060	and it is in a very I'm going to reset
139310	this you can see it drawing it isn't a
140960	very consistent kind of pattern which is
143120	good there's going to be some drift from
144770	the sensor but that's actually fine all
146750	sensors have some amount of drift but
149450	the good thing about it is that it's
150830	consistent it's not going all over the
152210	place and if you're not making robotic
154160	exact circular movements it's going to
156380	be extremely pretty
157290	where everything's going to be anyway so
158730	this is a good sign and this is for the
161340	G 900 so now we're testing the Razer
163409	Mamba exact same scenario this time
165540	we're going to try it with the signal
166860	noise on and with the signal noise off
169049	so you can see what it is in a more
171150	perfect scenario the Mamba is currently
173730	set up and good to go powered on joggers
175950	running and ten is over here let's go
178260	check the results all right so the Mamba
180599	2015 is hooked up inside that's what's
182579	running right now on the tracking tester
184620	as you can see on the spectrum analyzer
186239	in the back there's nothing really going
187980	on that's because we have the antenna
189690	off so what I'm going to do is come back
192329	here crank the antenna on so I'm going
196319	to turn this dial a little bit there
198540	that's all good to go the spectrum is
200970	now crazy you'll see it actually moves
202920	where it's where it's kind of firing
204690	huge amounts of spectrum so it's not
206250	going to be a consistent problem you can
207930	already see on here I'm going to reset
210180	it so that we have some more room to
211590	actually see it get messed up but it's
214319	jumped all over the place these lines
216299	that you see is where it stopped
217980	tracking completely for a second and
219780	then engage back in somewhere else
221340	you can see that instead of just simple
223319	sensor drift it's actually jumping all
225449	over the place I'm going to reset it
226739	here it's going okay at the start but
229319	then you see one big jump there I'll
232169	wait for it to do a few more there's one
234959	jump right there so there's going to be
236940	bad spots sometimes it'll be okay
238980	because maybe it's away from where the
241199	antennas firing huge amounts of
242639	information but then other times as you
244560	saw before it might actually start
246000	jumping all over the place because it's
247349	kind of getting overpowered which is not
249299	very good so there's a line there
251069	there's another line there it's getting
252569	a little bit worse now yeah so that's
254730	the mob of 2015 let's move on all right
257849	next up on the chopping block is the
259470	Ouroboros a little bit of an older Mouse
261389	it's currently running on the jogger
263070	it's sensor is currently over here we're
264990	good to go one other little bit of
266490	information that I want to give you guys
268139	is this is the antenna that's receiving
270180	the signal so when we show you guys the
272159	spectrum analyzer this is the thing
274139	that's outputting that information just
275520	in case you're interested so next up
277800	razor or Bose that's on the inside right
280289	now you see it going with nothing really
282419	happening on the spectrum analyzer seems
284639	fine a little bit of sensor drift which
286440	is completely normal
287580	now let's hurt it a little bit
289490	Oh turn things up there we go spectrum
296750	analyzers going like crazy stuff
298069	sweeping across like we saw before
300340	moving back now that happy little bit of
304250	sensor drift is no longer really very
306080	happy as you can see there's already two
308270	major jumps and it's completely changed
310550	direction three major jumps now yeah so
314330	not the clean nice patterned thing that
317660	we saw with the G 900 it's a little bit
319490	more of a mess now looking back there's
321319	one two three four five six major jumps
326030	I think and instead of just drifting
328009	nicely upwards like it was before you're
329900	going up and then cranking way over to
331880	the right and it's probably going to
333470	screw up again later on not the end of
335479	the world but not perfect
337039	last but potentially not least is this
339650	sensei so we have the sense I rigged up
341389	on the jogger and we have its receiver
343220	on the other side something to notice
345590	about the configuration of things as
347060	well the receivers are always placed in
349190	line with the very front of the mouse
351080	and the way that the jogger works
352819	there's little arms going all the way
354680	around so that it can hold it in place
356659	perfectly despite the movement of the
359000	actual jogger and it doesn't have to
361400	press any button so it's not pressing
362900	left or right buttons it's not pressing
364370	the back buttons it's not doing any of
365900	that kind of stuff and it's holding it
367490	in place which is pretty cool so the
369650	sensei isn't doing so great
372590	you can see on the spectrum analyzer
373639	there's nothing really going on we
375560	basically have it off and that's not
379370	just simple normal nice unified sensor
383300	drift
383719	that's quite messy let's start over
385969	again somewhere clean give it a nice
387530	clean slate and then hit it with the
390110	antenna as hard as we can go
394360	just to see what happened Wow okay so
397310	this one oh that is just that is
401300	horrible so one of the interesting
403190	things that this one does that none of
404990	the other ones actually had a problem
406400	with as you can see the lines get kind
408919	of squiggly and they start doing weird
411430	spirals and actually making things that
414710	aren't at all the shape of what it's
416630	doing which is a huge unusable problem
420560	again something to remember this
422360	is an insane worst-case scenario it's
424610	beyond like a normal kind of worst-case
427490	scenario because they went from a like
429620	300 person ComputerLand which is an
432139	insane scenario for any wireless device
433879	that made it a little bit harder but
436180	this thing is completely failing the
438889	other ones were failing pretty hard and
440599	the G 900 had zero issues whatsoever so
443900	I think that's pretty cool so to create
446659	the device the G 900 that beats all of
449419	the other devices in this crazy
450800	worst-case scenario test it takes a lot
452840	of things skill science testing all that
455360	kind of stuff it's not just by the
457340	better thing put the better thing in and
459139	then you have a better object it's not
461120	that simple so what they do is they use
463129	simulators in order to test what the
466039	actual end result is going to be that's
468319	not always perfect and just putting
470479	something in there and running a single
471740	error won't magically solve all of your
473120	problems that's where the skill
474650	component comes in they're able to get
476300	their RF simulator results to be
478490	extremely similar to their actual
481400	measurement through skill that's
483590	extremely important because it helps
485779	with your iteration process you that way
487610	you don't have to build a new full
489620	device every single time you want to
491449	test it which is going to help a lot
493009	because they have to release a product
494389	sometime then they also have to pay
496940	attention to where different components
498919	within the mouse go like the battery
501529	battery is a huge deal with some older
504110	mice that even Logitech had the
506240	positioning of the battery could cause
507889	weak spots in your signal as it went
510199	around but the sizing and the
511969	positioning of this battery is a little
513320	bit better they they have it on a
514820	different z-axis within the mouse so
517010	that the emitter should be able to have
519289	a strong signal going all the way around
521019	super cool next up we've got the sensor
523940	lab so what we're going to be doing here
525410	is testing motion latency so how long it
528560	takes for a movement of the mouse to
531019	actually go to the computer we're not
532519	worried about the last rest of the
533720	latency in the system this is just what
535430	Logitech would have control over so
537230	we're going to do that by coming in here
539449	and using this turntable the service on
541760	here is just like a SteelSeries qck type
544190	surface so probably something that's
546050	pretty common in someone's home we're
548000	going to start with the logitech g930
555570	exactly how much someone would be
557070	pushing down on the surface because II
558570	don't want to grind against the mousepad
559950	you don't do anything like that that
561300	would mess up with the results next up
563130	we'll have a Razer chroma which is
564840	actually a wired mouse so we'll compare
566520	it against that and then we have a Mamba
568920	2015 which is another competitor
570840	wireless mouse there's a little bit of
573350	plus/minus here that could be plus zero
576360	to one millisecond or anywhere in
578460	between due to polling rate but spoiler
580500	alert it's going to win by more than
582090	that so it doesn't really matter
584010	another thing I forgot to mention is
585690	that the mouse is placed very
587490	specifically on the turntable mousepad
590190	it's placed at a 45 degree angle so that
592620	x and y axes are contributing the exact
595260	same amount they have to be very precise
597090	about these things because extra
598620	variables like that could screw with
600150	something in a way that would mess up
601920	your results so they have the right
604290	amount of tension down they have the
605790	right angle and they have a huge amount
608460	of samples all of which are good alright
610440	so we're going to run our first test
611580	here you can go right now and what
614340	you'll see on the screen in a moment is
616080	it's going to accumulate data over time
618270	so what's actually going to be displayed
620360	graphically is rounded a little bit just
623280	more for presentation so that you can
624900	kind of see where about things are but
627300	below that is more of the hard core math
629820	no rounding and you can see the mean so
632070	we have to wait a little bit for it to
633600	gather some data and then we'll give you
635520	a more accurate need so after taking 33
639120	samples of movement the mean latency was
641790	four point seven nine milliseconds so
644970	that might not sound impressive yet but
647280	just wait till we try the other mice
648450	we're about to run test - this is
650940	against the Razer chroma which is
652260	actually a wired mouse you can see here
654420	in the device info it is in fact the
656100	Razer chroma we're going to be comparing
657930	it against our previous file which was
659820	running the G 900 so we're gonna have
661920	blue data showing up on the chart that's
664830	for the previous Mouse and the green
667350	data you as you can see in here color
669210	green will be actually for the chroma so
671940	let's run the test so we have our first
673980	results the G 900 versus the Razer
676320	chroma as you can see here the green is
679110	much higher than the blue which means
680520	that the green lost this is motion
683100	latency so you want a low number as you
685650	can see the mute
686740	in for the G 900 was 4.8 as we already
689800	discussed the blue is the same numbers
691810	that we had running on our previous
693040	tests but the mean for the chroma is
695830	about six point eight eight which is two
699220	milliseconds more which is a lot because
701410	you have to pay attention to each
704080	segment of your latency throughout the
705670	entire entire equation so your graphics
708850	card your monitor your mouse all that
710320	kind of stuff and reducing each one by
712959	relatively small amounts is a huge deal
716350	so you can get the total number lower
718120	so having Logitech's number of the input
720160	from their mouse due to motion lower is
722020	good and that means that it's lower than
724570	a wired mouse which is pretty damn
726190	impressive another kind of cool thing to
727540	look at is that the lowest so the
730330	fastest rate at which the motion was
732370	able to go from the mouse to the
733839	computer for the Razer Mouse was about
736480	five point five which tied the highest
740080	or worst results from the G 900 just
742570	kind of a fun little tidbit so this time
744640	the most we are testing is the Razer
746050	Mamba as you can see in the top we're
748089	comparing it yet again against the G 900
750490	so the compare with file is the original
752589	G 900 tests that we ran again we're
754899	doing 33 33 trials the exact same that
757600	we're doing every time this time it's
759250	going to show up as pink so yeah let's
761500	get started okay so we're done testing
763870	the Mamba 2015 and this is kind of why I
767589	haven't liked Wireless mice in the past
769990	and probably why a lot of people haven't
771820	either look at the data it's a mess
773950	you've got results from 0.5 which are
776380	junk data we'll explain why that's junk
778329	data in a moment all the way up to 18
780700	point 5 which is probably caused due to
783910	lag in the transmission of data over the
786550	wireless signal if it misses a report
789190	and then has to do it later it's going
790540	to be massively delayed your mean is at
793180	about nine point three which is much
795970	higher than the four point seven nine of
799420	the G 900 but probably more within the
802690	actual capabilities of the sensor the
805149	problems with the junk data and the
807220	really really high late reported data is
810339	more due to the implementation of the
812680	sensor instead of the standard
814149	capabilities
815199	last but not least we have click latency
817810	so realistically what all of these
819160	different stations have been
820510	explaining is that we don't necessarily
821950	need to be afraid of Wireless anymore I
824320	was afraid of Wireless before but I
826660	think that was justified before this
828610	mouse came out because as we've seen
830440	there were some problems with wireless
832570	mice now click latency would be a huge
835090	one if it was worse than say a wired
837100	mouse so what we're going to do here is
838510	actually measure that so I'll explain
839980	how we'll do that now they have a wire
842440	going into here but you can see that
844030	it's not the actual normal one this is
845680	wired directly into the switch instead
847960	of actually the mouse itself so that you
851350	have your wireless adapter still running
853300	that has been done on the G 900 arrival
856540	300 and a Razer chroma so you can see
859270	there's two wires going into each one of
860980	these because these are more naturally
862510	wired mice I'm going to move these guys
864250	out of the way this wire from the switch
869140	is going into a signal adapter this then
872620	sends it to a latency measurer so what
875740	this one is recording off the bat is
878080	exactly when the switch is pressed and
882700	then it starts a timer from that point
884830	in time to when this adapter is able to
887950	send the signal to the USB analyzer so
891010	that's when it actually receives the
893230	signal that the switch was pressed
895030	because that one isn't wired in that's a
897160	wireless signal so you get to see the
898780	total latency of the mouse within your
901420	system similar to how we were testing
903520	total latency of the mouse in previous
905890	sections this isn't the total latency
907270	until something would appear on your
909640	screen because there's other things
910930	within that equation like your graphics
912370	card on your monitor and whatnot but
913870	this is what Logitech can control so in
916570	order to actually run the test they set
918670	up this kind of game thing where you go
920290	click on the lit up circle this is just
923110	causing you to click a number of times
925210	at different intervals so that can be
926980	recorded over here much like the motion
929260	testing motion latency testing that we
931060	did earlier it'll show up a graph which
932860	will have some slightly rounded numbers
934540	but will give a good visual
935710	representation of the results so we're
937420	going to run this about 30 clicks and
939790	then get a result after that so as you
943750	can see graphically our average is about
945910	4.5 it kind of all Huddle's in a nice
949030	bell curve right around that area and
950890	our
952380	called not really rounded as much
954030	average is at about four point three so
957120	prizing lee similar to the latency in
959190	our motion input latency tests so yeah
962100	let's move on and try the other mice the
964410	first contender is the SteelSeries rival
966000	300 which has its firmware updated to
968910	the most recent one since last Friday so
970440	it's a wired mouse so theoretically up
972930	until now it should be faster so we'll
975120	see if it rains and holds that title
976850	let's begin the results and then
978870	compared against the G 900 okay so
982380	looking up here we can see the blue data
984780	is from the logitech g930 naita is from
988650	the SteelSeries rival 300 you can see
991950	again the mean or general average from
995070	the Logitech G 909 300 it's kind of less
1002270	of a more perfect bell curve the mean
1004520	looks somewhere around 7.5 though moving
1006710	over to the actual math of things it
1008930	looks like the average is d about 7.6
1011210	which is a pretty significant increase
1013580	which is not good you want a lower
1015800	number again it's more like golf so it's
1018680	not over yet let's try one more so the
1020780	program can only store two sets of data
1022550	at a time so for round three I'm
1024500	actually going to have to redo the G 900
1026959	so here we go G 900 test two and then
1030560	the G 900 test two will be compared
1033050	against the Razer chroma okay so that's
1038569	not really very good for the other team
1041150	looking at the graphical average now
1043010	it's probably at like a little bit below
1045709	11 and yeah that's about right ten point
1049970	nine milliseconds compared to four point
1052190	two nine
1053260	sounds like Wireless wins okay that was
1056840	actually kind of Awesome I'm pretty
