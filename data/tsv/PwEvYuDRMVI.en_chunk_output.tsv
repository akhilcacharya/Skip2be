6919	welcome to yet another unboxing today I
9450	have something pretty cool actually I
11190	have five things that are pretty cool so
14099	I had the Diablo series of qck limited
17640	edition mouse pads from Steel series so
20070	they're limited edition branded mouse
22260	pads tend to get a lot of praise for a
25019	couple of reasons one of them is that
27119	the artwork is usually like badass
29550	whether it's their Starcraft ones their
31920	Warcraft ones or in this case finally we
34920	have Diablo ones and the other reason is
38100	that the qck is just the best mousepad a
40649	bar and that's a bar with an a not with
44280	and two E's so we're gonna have a look
47489	at one of them to start and then I'm
48840	gonna unbox them all off camera and then
51120	show you all the different artworks that
52920	are available with the qck so you can
55199	see this is a cloth mousepad it's a
56760	flexible nose pad this one is the just
59129	the plain Diablos and we're back so my
62190	evidence then I truly think the qck is
64589	like the bestest mousepad ever is that I
66780	have my ancient beat-up qck plus on my
70530	desk which has actually been machine
72780	washed probably about three times it's
75330	starting to get pretty threadbare but I
77850	truly do love the qck and one of the
80070	things that SteelSeries has managed to
81750	do with their graphics covered mouse
84360	pads is they've managed to make it so
86369	your mouse doesn't track like crap in
88200	spite of the graphics on it so whether
90540	that's the ink they're using or whether
92070	it's the way they're designing the
93299	patterns I actually don't know but
95700	unlike so many mouse pads with artwork
98130	on them they don't they don't skip as
100380	you cross over from a light to a dark to
103259	a dark color so that's really cool it
105479	comes with us feel series sticker as
107130	well as a little SteelSeries brochure
109439	about their other products so give me a
110700	sec your guys I'm gonna open up them all
111960	and and we'll go through them so here
114270	we've got five different Diablo 3 mouse
116880	pads we've got the stay Plain Jane
118710	Diablo 3 one personally I think this is
121110	actually my favorite although if I had
122880	to pick a second favorite it would
124229	definitely be the witch hunter so if you
126060	want to get in close he'll be able to
127259	hear I'm gonna bring the light
128369	closer so that the lighting is good so
131549	you can really see how awesome they look
133709	so slick educated me and evidently this
137190	is the barbarian this is the witch
138989	hunter this is the monk this is not the
141840	butt oh no this is the witch doctor
143970	witch doctor and then this is the rogue
147659	or demon hunter whichever you prefer I'm
149489	calling it a rogue he insists it's a
151230	demon hunter because it has a crossbow
152970	to which I replied that rogues may also
155849	use crossbows
156750	in pretty much every game I've ever
158640	played to which he was like Touche so
162000	that is pretty much how our conversation
164280	went
164760	while we were opening them up in between
166590	trying to figure out how to get all of
168420	the boxes open in the first place so in
171390	conclusion the qck is a wicked awesome
173909	mousepad it lasts for like a couple
175650	years these ones have some pretty neat
177720	graphics on them that look like pretty
179640	neat and they're like licensed by
181379	Blizzard so you know that it actually
183239	cost SteelSeries a lot more to make
184769	these the actual cost of the materials
187170	because Blizzard always takes their cut
189299	and no offense to anyone from Blizzard
192419	who's watching this I know that you know
193709	everyone's gotta earn a living so thank
195900	you for checking out my unboxing of the
197669	SteelSeries diablo 3 mouse pads don't
200549	forget to subscribe to - tech tips from
201900	unboxings reviews and other computer
203190	videos and i almost miss the most
204209	important part its got like an awesome
206489	rubberized back that makes it so that
209370	once you put it down it law okay well
211620	this is a bad example because i have a
213000	tablecloth but it doesn't move up come
214590	over here you cannot move the mouse pad
217349	once you put it down in spite of the
219090	fact that this one paul dime check that
221730	out in spite of the fact that this one
224220	has been washed in the machines several
226500	times and still works and probably needs
228389	to be washed now because when my kettle
230340	in my towers here my cats jump up here
232319	and then up here and then if their paws
233910	are dirty then they get it all dirty
235319	it's disgusting don't forget to
