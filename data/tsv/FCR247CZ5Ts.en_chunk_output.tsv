7100	me onyx light-years ahead of the game
9980	that is their slogan this is the Seibel
13280	60 high performance gaming keyboard and
15860	this keyboard seems to have everybody
19310	very very excited about it so there's a
22160	bunch of different things that me onyx
24080	is going to call out on the back here
25670	and I will go ahead and run you through
27109	them
27710	it has media and illumination function
29929	keys up here it has a heavy-duty braided
32630	cable it has a full speed USB 2.0 hub
34970	that's actually a really good feature to
36560	see so many keyboards still include USB
39950	1.1 hubs which is infuriating if you go
42200	and plug a flash drive in oh why is it
44239	going so slow well that's why okay it
46730	has green backlit Kia lumination which I
48770	love I love green lighting whether it's
52670	in the case or on your components or
55039	whatever the case may be love it I think
57109	it looks great it has a Munich's action
59149	key instead of a Windows key over on
61160	this side so you're not going to
62059	accidentally bump that while you're
63260	gaming a detachable wrist rest is also
65900	featured on the bottom which I'll show
67400	you when I open it up and oh my I can't
69800	believe they put this on the box okay
71900	we'll get to that
72490	okay black cherry MX mechanical key
75439	switches that is critical why is this
78080	expensive because it uses proper
80210	mechanical key switches cherry blacks so
83450	if you use any keyboard that has cherry
85280	black switches then you will know
86780	approximately what it's going to feel
88159	like catchable rest rest green backlit
90530	multi level brightness control neonics
92810	action key to access light flash media
95119	controls okay six key rollover and I'm
97340	going to skip this next one because it's
98659	hilarious I'm saving it for last
100310	okay you can connect through port
101930	connector ports for audio and mic full
104990	speed USB 2.0 hot plug and play and
106759	check look at this
110079	rage proof durability yeah I know right
116829	rage proof durability so we're gonna
119899	we're gonna have to have a look at this
121430	thing okay the Onyx Ziegel 60 start has
124880	been born model overview so they have to
127219	say for themselves the Seibel 60 is a
128869	fusion of the best keyboard components
130610	together
131020	great gaming features that give you the
132970	edge to your game engineered with non
135310	tactile interesting mechanical black
138250	Cherry MX switches that deliver the best
140080	feel to every keystroke I'm gonna have
141550	to see what they mean by non tactile
143110	okay with a six key roll over that
146530	allows you to perform up to six
147910	simultaneous keystrokes with any key on
150550	the keyboard remember that is a
151690	limitation of USB not of the keyboard
154420	itself otherwise I'm sure it can do more
156400	than six in addition to the performance
158560	feature that offers smart functions like
160390	to port USB 2.0 hub audio and mic
163360	extensions of media control keys for
164920	full integration with your desktop setup
166360	neato neat so neat semi Tiki neat okay
170500	responsiveness is two millimeters four
173380	millimeters to the bottom of the key
174760	let's look at all these technical
176170	specifications switch mount is 18 karat
178810	gold-plated backed Cherry MX black
181030	linear mechanical switch actuation force
182920	of 60 grams so if you care about any of
184810	this stuff you can read it here and
186180	finally we have installation which
188920	should be fairly straightforward for a
190240	keyboard and that's about it now let's
194440	look at the zile keyboard itself okay
202630	okay you know what I had said I have our
206350	I had glossed over the thick braided
209470	cable but I did not know how thick a
213430	braided cable could be this is a
216520	heavy-duty cable I will give them that
219070	check this out you guys this is like the
221770	thickness of a of my pinky finger almost
226350	huge
227710	look look thickness compared to an
229660	iPhone that is that is a heavy-duty
231670	cable if I have ever seen one that's the
233500	first thing that stands up to me about
235540	this particular keyboard right as I open
238420	it up here so I'm creeping towards
241190	assistant which I actually this is a new
243750	camera assistant who I don't really have
245400	a nickname for yet we'll have to work on
247170	something you know maybe if you guys
248520	want to leave suggestions in the
249900	comments of this video for what you
251730	think my new assistants nickname should
253650	be this is not crazy Russian and this is
255900	not the cameraman somebody else alright
258570	at the end we are going to find two USB
260430	ports one of them is for the keyboard
262590	and you can see it has a picture of what
264000	looks like a keyboard on it one of them
265710	is for the hub which has the word hub on
267750	it and finally we have pass-throughs for
270420	our headphones as well as microphone so
273690	that instead of plugging them around to
274980	the back of the computer we can plug
276690	them around to the back of the keyboard
278940	where we will also find the USB hub so
281430	there's your mouse there's a USB key
282930	boom there you go
284780	alright let's attach the rest wrist rest
288300	after we have a look at the bottom of
290130	the keyboard so we've got a couple of
291450	these guys in case you want it to lean
293880	up a little bit more we've got four
295800	rubber pads on the bottom so well yeah
299700	it says our grippy it's not going to
301230	slip around once it's put down outfit
305130	rage Oh see we're finding out if it's
307920	rage proof already alright we have four
309750	more rubber pads on the bottom of the
311220	wrist rest let's go ahead and let goes
314160	on and there is a keyboard as its
319500	intended to be used so the first thing
321420	I'm going to do is I'm going to evaluate
322890	the layout because I'm pretty particular
324810	about keyboard layout and it's going to
327120	get major points off if they've done
329100	anything outlandish so first things
331140	first if I need to capitalize something
333300	that I'm typing with my right hand will
335190	I be able to reach the shift key the
336420	answer is yes I hate short shift keys I
338760	can't reach them next if I do something
341550	over here can I capitalize yes I can
343470	nice long shift keys both sides
345330	excellent finally I made a mistake can I
348600	reach the backspace key the answer is
350310	yes I hate short backspace keys they are
354000	me I wish they all died in a fire okay
357990	next let's look at the overall layout of
360450	the other stuff here as well so we've
362760	got our function keys up here mute
364650	volume down volume up play stop forward
368130	and back brightness and keyboard button
371940	okay I'm not 100% sure what that one
373650	does go ahead and leave
374460	comment on the video if you know and
376440	then everything else is a fairly
378509	standard layout actually everything here
380850	is pretty normal they haven't gone in
382500	like you know changed these and made
385020	this like a long delete or anything like
386849	that it's all pretty normal we've got
389509	LEDs here for our number lock caps lock
392220	and scroll lock number pad and you know
394770	I'm just gonna have a good look at what
396240	I think I need mmm that's actually
399180	really nice I wonder if the keys come
402960	off easily
403590	that's something I've noticed about
404490	mechanical keyboards in the past is I've
406440	actually been in the middle of gaming
407759	and a gum like like this and the control
409740	key pops off but it looks like these are
411419	a little bit more difficult to remove
413699	than that overall it has a very matte
415979	finish to it so you're not going to have
417930	too much trouble with like it looking
419669	like a greasy fingerprint cheeto covered
422250	mess in time these are fairly quiet
427470	actually for mechanical keyboard as well
429330	so that's a consideration you know when
431460	you're in a late night gaming session
432780	and you're typing away on the keyboard
434039	here I'll let you guys evaluate for
435750	yourselves actually so it's not very
441900	very quiet it's not like a laptop
443250	keyboard by any stretch of the
444539	imagination but for a mechanical
446130	keyboard that's actually pretty darn
447990	good and I think that's pretty much all
451889	they're civil why don't we plug it in
453240	and find out what it looks like in the
454320	dark okay so we figured out what the
457889	keyboard button up here on the f12 does
460289	so if you hold the me onyx button and
461759	press it it actually toggles the
464039	different lighting modes so you can see
467099	it's either WASD nothing
469289	there's WASD right now or the full
472229	keyboard is backlit that looks amazing I
474389	hope I hope you guys can see how good
476280	this looks all of the keys are very
477900	evenly lit which is very impressive
480389	that's that's really cool because a lot
482909	of the time you see these backlit
484169	keyboard where it's kind of like it's
485460	bright over here and dim here and
487139	there's like another hotspot over on
488370	this side no looks really good and let's
490889	see what we've got in terms of
491940	brightness control so it looks like we
493560	have three different levels so there's
495030	the dimmest there's the next and there's
497430	the brightest personally I'd have this
498810	on brightest all the time I think it
500699	looks out
501600	standing so thank you for checking out
502860	my unboxing of the zville 60 don't
505380	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
