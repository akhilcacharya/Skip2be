30	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2429	the G 400 s from Logitech which is part
5009	of their new G series which is all about
7980	for science or rather science wins so
11790	here you go when you open it up normally
13799	you'd find a bunch of stuff about DPI's
15599	and CPI's and GPAs and all that kind of
19770	stuff but what you actually find inside
21810	here is just this advanced surface
23640	materials feel the difference a durable
25910	hydrophobic palm surface soft touch side
28769	grips and fingerprint resistant button
30449	coatings so what they're going for here
32279	is what the thing actually feels like to
34829	touch I mean yeah you're going to find
36059	specks on the outside of the box as well
37469	so 400 to 4,000 dpi this is an optical
40170	mouse so you don't get those crazy like
42329	8000 dpi sort of ranges that you can do
45539	with laser 25 G's of max acceleration a
48450	thousand reports for per second this is
50190	one of the differences between the G
51480	400s and the G 100's aside from the
54270	shape and just overall generally being a
55920	higher-end Mouse twenty million clicks
57960	is the durability rating for the buttons
59550	with two hundred and fifty kilometers
61070	for the the the not the slippy feet on
64438	the bottom although I would be tempted
66330	to test one of these mice at some point
68369	and see if I can get like a warranty
70590	replacement like if I dragged it behind
72090	a car for 250 kilometers and I'm like
75150	yeah we're through like do they mean 250
78180	kilometers on a road surface or on a
79740	mouse pad I'm just kidding I know what
82290	they mean so let's go ahead and open
83549	this bad boy up this is the iconic
86479	Logitech shape so if you've ever owned a
89909	g5 or a G 500 or even going back to my
93210	classic MX duo which was my first
96650	high-performance keyboard mouse set
98970	you've pretty much touched one of these
101400	which is handy because you know what
102930	you're getting yourself into it's got a
104820	three year warranty and they're saying
106380	you need Windows 8 Windows 7 or Windows
107850	Vista but I would be floored if they
110369	don't work with if it doesn't work with
112530	Windows XP last thing is there's
114210	cluesive delta0 sensor for consistent
116520	high accuracy targeting and that's
119460	pretty much it so let's go ahead and
120840	check this out so they've got a bit of a
122219	different packaging style than I've seen
124469	on a Logitech product before so it's
126119	like a blue blue inside then we've got
129270	some presumably like a Quick Start Guide
131580	or something like that
132599	Logitech has long
133890	to go done away with including CDs with
136050	their products which i think is great
137160	because they're just wasteful quite
139380	frankly you should always go to the
141150	manufacturers website and download the
142680	latest drivers and here we go so eight
145920	programmable buttons are featured on the
148260	Wow really this is hard to I mean I've
152190	unboxed a lot of stuff but this is a
153870	this is challenging it's like stuck in
157410	there ah yes success yeah I totally lost
166709	my train of thought we'll be back in a
168870	little bit now it's a little strange to
171000	me that Logitech didn't include a
172769	braided cable quite frankly it's not
174780	like it affects the performance of the
176519	mouse in any way but it just makes it
178110	feel a little bit more more premium when
180900	you're dropping a few bucks on it on a
182519	gaming mouse for what it's worth it does
184590	have a sufficient length so it'll be
186090	able to reach not only to the front of
187950	your case but also round to the back
189150	without any difficulty so it looks like
190680	it's about yeah six and a half seven
193470	feet long something along those lines
194610	now
195660	they've talked a lot about the materials
198120	here and they really are exceptional so
201390	this has a grippy feel without being
205459	without being rubber sort of with how do
209100	you describe it you can lift it without
211140	it feeling like your fingers are stuck
212760	to it and then on the back there's a
214829	little tiny bit of texture here that
217670	just I don't know it actually does feel
220049	kind of nice same thing up here on the
221549	buttons as well
222600	I mean honestly though if Logitech sales
225269	pitch for these mice is you know twenty
227040	million clicks and two hundred and fifty
228600	kilometers and advanced materials
230220	there's nothing I can tell you in an
232110	unboxing that's going to tell you like
234030	oh yeah the materials they used are
235530	great because what it's going to come
236640	down to is does it peel in two or three
239579	years
240000	like so many rubberized grips on the
242370	outsides of my student Logitech's
243959	claiming that these are some of the most
245640	durable materials in existence for mice
248070	but I mean it's it's hard to sell
250530	something like that when we're not going
252540	to know how great it is until it's
254579	people have been using them for a few
256228	years so at any rate no adjustable
258510	weights or anything like that you've
259649	just got your standard optical sensor
261390	hole on the bottom as well as your
262800	slippy feet here you've got back and
265080	forward buttons and they're ideal
266430	locations I've
267510	like the way logitech implements these
269130	it was my MX do that got me used to the
271500	idea of having back and forward buttons
273000	now I really can't live without them
275510	other buttons they've also included our
277800	dpi increase and decrease remember
279810	they're all programmable as well as a
281550	default dpi button although this one
283620	requires you to install the software
285000	it's also got a middle click as well as
287280	left and right clicks and it's got a
289200	really slick looking G in the middle for
291390	their new G series overall feels good
295050	it's a little bit on the lighter side of
297450	medium so it's not a super lightweight
299190	Mouse but it's not heavy by any stretch
300930	of the imagination and I think that
302550	pretty much wraps this up thank you for
303780	checking out my unboxing again first
305250	look at the G 400s from Logitech don't
