30	now this is something I wanted to have a
1530	look at for a little while this is the
3540	logitech wireless gaming mouse g700 now
6660	I actually had a g7 for a number of
9330	years quite enjoyed that Mouse I mean
11790	you know what let's face it it was
14099	really good for the time but once I
16710	upgraded to a to a more faster better
21150	wired mouse I did notice the leg that I
24510	had been living with all that time now I
26910	don't know if the g7 hundred people I
29670	don't know yet if the G 700 fixes that
32579	but we can definitely have a look at
35309	what is in the box and what features
38010	make this particular Mouse interesting
39960	so why do we look at the tracking first
41309	so the resolution is two hundred two
43620	fifty seven hundred dpi the image
45360	processing is 12 megapixels per second
47820	with max acceleration of 30 G's and then
50820	max speed of up to 165 inches per second
55699	look at that alright responsiveness up
58859	to 1,000 reports per second which is
61320	good it's about the fastest it goes
63049	dynamic coefficient of friction look at
65640	that that's that on it and a static
67950	coefficient of friction okay
70170	the durability eight million clicks and
73619	the feet can go 250 kilometers tested on
77670	most popular gaming with pet services
79860	cool cool ok 13 precisely placed fully
84299	programmable controls epic really ok let
90869	the record show it actually has the word
93720	epic on the package so this thing better
96840	be
97110	epically comfortable gaming grade
99210	Wireless powerful control that gets you
101189	deep into your game there's a little
103049	wireless receiver which is a big
104520	improvement over the clunky base station
106530	with battery charger that the g7 had 13
109500	programmable controls with macro
111210	capability natural support of shape ball
113700	speed wireless plug and forget nano
115290	receiver whoops I'm not even focused on
117509	the right language here rechargeable
120479	data over cable ok gaming grade laser
124770	dual mold scroll wheel smooth gliding
127619	feet on Romero dual mob scroll wheel is
129780	actually a cool feature and it has an
131310	LED display look at that alright so
133930	have a look yet the packaging itself
136810	Logitech products can sometimes be a bit
140200	of a challenge to unbox so hopefully
142420	this is not the case today as I'm not
145090	really up for an unboxing challenge I'd
147159	rather just cheek sound simple and have
149650	a look at the product right now okay
154930	that's not too challenging so far oh
157620	hold on let me get challenging and it
162489	all sort of like fell apart now awesome
165129	okay so the first thing we find here is
168329	a oh it's okay so it's aus sorry my
172480	angles a little off here it's a USB
174370	extension cable for the micro receiver
180790	okay
181709	neato so they I think they're
183879	recommending that you only really use it
185349	for the micro receiver right there next
187930	we have important information as well as
192129	getting started guy
194459	next we have look at that okay so it
198879	looks like you can turn it into a corded
200919	Mouse that's what this looks like to me
202479	that's a USB cable and then that's the
205030	receiver you know what we're gonna have
206739	to have a look at the mouse to figure
208030	out exactly how all of that works okay
213729	I'm suspicious but it's complicated at
216099	this point though here's the micro
217510	receiver so it's quite small my hand per
220449	scale g-series Dodger tech looks like
224889	that
225370	there's your part number and here is the
228370	epically comfortable so they say that is
231250	actually quite nice quite nice indeed
233919	the epically comfortable g700 so it
237430	looks like there's a and are those any
239259	loops Satana loop battery nice well
243040	played Logitech and the loops are my
247060	personal favourite in fact I will do a
249579	short demonstration of how Anna loops
252879	are indeed my favourite batteries here's
258639	a cat unrelated to n loops
262900	okay so there's my eneloop charger on
265090	the wall okay and here are extra and
271030	loops in fact in my camera I have more
274300	in a loop okay there's my g7 bevels okay
280210	that wasn't a very good demo but I
281530	actually have a lot of envelopes I think
283090	most of them are at work right now cuz
285270	that's where I use most of them when I
288130	whenever I'm swapping batteries for my
289750	camera okay so we're back let's have a
292479	look at the g700 mess and I get
294100	distracted anyway and lose batteries
295630	well played Logitech I approve I love in
299560	loops they're great they last a long
301479	time and they come charged which means
303789	your g700 Mouse can likely and I mean
307449	like pretty darn likely be used out of
309729	the box maybe not because it was flipped
312639	to the on switch so it's possible it's
314860	been draining in the packaging
316470	okay well it are you great no no it
319270	probably hasn't because it has this
320590	little uh yeah it's being blocked here
323169	so it's not making contact okay so yes
324669	it is charged and ready for use
327180	cool Wireless products that are charged
329740	and ready for use love it okay let's
331720	have a look at the macro buttons so
332979	first let's show that epic comfort so
335080	you can see the palm sits right here you
338500	curve your fingers over the mouse there
340419	they are on the buttons and your thumb
341710	goes right there actually it's more like
343030	about like this but it really does mold
345910	right to your hand that's really nice so
348789	there's four
349810	programmable macro G buttons on the side
352180	here one two three four okay there's
355449	three next to your index finger here one
358510	two three very conveniently reachable
361150	very ergonomic you can see they're
362530	actually curved in shape so that when
366160	your finger sits here you can push
367539	forward for this one push back for this
369699	one
369940	or push a little bit further back for
371620	this guy so they can all be reached
372820	quite easily two more here ah-ha that
378940	one is for the scroll wheel so that's
383919	the dual AMOLED scroll wheel with I
385360	there's a click eNOS or the flywheel
387900	okay here is another G button so that's
392110	not a debugger
393540	like a GE okay you've got your left and
396630	right click got your clicky on your
398730	scroll wheel and then that pretty much
400920	does it for buttons here's the slippy
402510	pads on the bottom on/off switch gaming
406530	laser the other side is fairly fairly
409020	bare but a whole lot going on there here
411330	is where that that charging wire plugs
414330	into okay so you you can use it while
418320	you're charging it or you can just leave
420960	it leave a charging and then pull it off
423060	when you're ready to use it and then the
424920	micro receiver plugs into that other
426900	cable and just stays plugged in or it
429630	plugs directly into your computer
430590	whichever you prefer for less
432000	interference you're probably gonna want
433350	to plug it into that cable and position
434910	it somewhere with you know line-of-sight
438090	to the G 700 or whatever else this looks
440490	like a dpi indicator right here well
443790	that I can confirm that I can't confirm
448920	that but I'm pretty sure that's what
450000	that's going to be so there it is that
452550	is the G 700 Mouse thank you for
457020	checking out my unboxing on - Texas Josh
459120	talked about the finish on this guy a
460380	little bit so it's got kind of a
461790	rubberized a grippy feel kinda likes of
463860	g9 personally I'm big fan of that
466920	it's very fingerprint resistant so your
469800	mouse isn't gonna look all greasy and
471210	nasty and it's also quite quite nice to
474720	grip onto so it's very easy to hold it
477990	in place however long you happen to be
480390	holding the mouse like this I also like
482190	how I mean this seems like a stupid demo
484320	but when you lift up the mouse it's very
487320	very difficult to drop it so it has a
489930	really really good shape for the hand
