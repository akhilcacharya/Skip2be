30	so today I'm a videoblog we're gonna be
1740	unboxing the Merc stealth keyboard this
4140	is a steelseries keyboard it's a fairly
6839	premium gaming keyboard and the reason
8790	for that that they bring is what they
10769	bring to the table is a unique gaming
12990	terrain layout so what that means is
15450	they've got a whole section of this
17100	keyboard that is dedicated entirely to
19310	gaming keys okay it has red blue or
22740	purple backlight and let's see what
25050	other interesting features they have on
27060	the back yeah that's pretty much it okay
31140	it supports simultaneous keystrokes like
33090	most gaming keyboards these days and to
35430	be perfectly honest with you the only
36600	reason I'm opening this thing is because
38399	I want to see it the camera man I have
42230	substituting for the real cameraman
44129	today actually says that he's tried it
46050	and it doesn't work for him because he
48030	uses some kind of like ancient old
50879	school way of gaming where he uses like
53579	the right and left mouse buttons to go
55379	forward and backwards and like a Zed to
57690	strafe left and right I was like what so
60359	it didn't work for him but I think for
62340	someone who uses a morte
63539	well okay less traditional but more
65280	modern building you a SD layout it might
67110	work so it comes with a SteelSeries
69060	sticker okay there it is it comes with a
72060	steel series terms and conditions which
74880	I can't imagine you could possibly care
77070	about it comes with a steel series
78750	professional gaming gear all this is
80340	just a brochure of some of their other
81600	products okay that's good and then it
84720	comes with download software you know I
87330	really like to see this instead of a
89280	disc to be perfectly honest most people
91170	have the Internet these days you can go
93090	download the latest version of the
94920	software and where drivers and this is
98360	okay this is like a manual how to use
101430	your merc stealth so the Merc stealth is
103470	kind of like the Merc except that it has
105540	a backlight and I think they've changed
107430	the aesthetic of it slightly so before
110430	we look at the keyboard itself why don't
111990	we just check out the cables that we
114090	have running out of the back here so I
115530	just got to get this a zip tie off and
117229	here we go so we've got one thick cable
119640	coming out of the Merc stealth and that
121710	plugs into a USB port on your computer
124290	as well as your headphone and mic jacks
127170	on the back of your computer so what
128758	that means is that this keyboard does
130348	have support for a USB hub
132700	and then it also has support for you to
134920	plug your headset and while your headset
137230	into the keyboard itself that just means
139180	you're able to run a shorter wire as
140769	opposed to a lot of other keyboards
142959	which don't have that feature now you do
145150	have little stands and if I could get
146890	the cameraman to kind of get like a
148060	weird angle on this here from the side
149739	so you can see how much that elevates
151720	the keyboard versus running it just flat
154030	like that there you go and then let's
156459	have a look at the gaming terrain
158050	because besides the gaming train you've
159880	got a fairly bog-standard layout here
162000	okay tactile feedback on the keys but
164680	basically what it comes down to is this
167230	part of the keyboard so we're actually
169120	I'm just gonna go ahead and put my hands
171190	here so there's your WASD there's your Q
173709	and E so to speak because they've got it
175810	sort of mapped out for you that way and
177640	then you've got tab caps lock I'm not
180280	sure who uses caps lock for gaming but
182049	yeah I find it gets in the way more than
183819	anything else
184540	there's shift control so actually shift
188560	shift forward that's kind of nice so the
191530	way they've mapped it out basically is
193540	such that you've got a similar layout to
195730	here but it's supposed to be quite a bit
197290	more comfortable and more ergonomic to
199329	have your hand coming in at this angle
200530	you've got far easier access to all of
203230	your number keys so it means you're
204700	gonna be able to reach all of your
206290	weapons far more easily as well as
208420	access with your thumb to quite a few
210430	more keys than you'd normally have so
212470	actually it's kind of a pretty
213880	cool-looking feature I'd like the
215650	cameraman to just kind of have like a
217060	quick look at the keyboard overall I
218859	don't see anything particularly stupid
220840	about the layout like every once in a
222430	while you'll see something like a
223480	shortened Shift key or a short backspace
225910	key or something ridiculous like that
227350	doesn't have any of those mistakes and
229600	we'll just have a quick look at the back
231430	and thank you for checking out my video
233950	blog on the SteelSeries merchant stealth
