960	[Music]
6770	welcome to my unboxing of the Philco
9210	magistrates ninja this particular
12059	configuration is the fkb and 104 m / e
15990	FB - it has a black body color a 140
19680	layout it uses brown cherry key switches
21869	as well as a featuring n key rollover
24269	which means you can type with link you
27119	know by sitting on the keyboard you know
29010	should you say you fit and all of the
31349	keystrokes will be registered it also
34260	uses front-facing keys which when I
36270	originally heard about the concept and
38309	saw it in pictures I kind of hated it
40800	and I thought I wouldn't like it at all
42120	but it makes for a very clean looking
46020	keyboard that also has the advantage of
48450	when you're sitting in front of it which
50250	is where you'll probably be sitting
51480	being very very easy to read so it's
54180	very nice it turns out I'm actually kind
58379	of a fan of this particularly so this
60840	keyboard right here comes with well a
62640	cord so no frills no gimmicks great
66299	build quality overall very solid feel
69619	excellent workmanship no frills no
72780	built-in USB hub it does come with a USB
75360	to ps2 adapter and it comes with a
77400	couple of other little things comes with
79350	a key remover which you can use just
81479	like this to remove keys no ink so there
87509	you see the cherry bound brown switches
88860	cherry brew and switches are more linear
90840	they are less tactile feeling and they
93060	don't really have a perceivable click
95070	which isn't to say that they're quiet
96930	either because pretty much any
98520	mechanical keyboard is going to be
100409	louder than a membrane keyboard just due
103530	to 12 the way that people type of them
106890	they tend to type on them louder however
111110	so you have the disadvantage of annoying
113520	your neighbor or your sleeping baby or
115619	whatever else the case may be but there
117270	are advantages to they are more
119219	comfortable and you will type faster on
121170	a mechanical keyboard versus on a cheap
123090	membrane keyboard especially if you find
125100	the one that's just right for you
126420	so it's highly recommended that you try
128610	a wide variety of different mechanical
130470	keyboards especially
131670	the different key switches and then
133500	search for the layout that you find
136140	suits you best there's also an Philco is
138720	actually a great brand that way because
140430	they have a ton of different varieties
142620	of products available so you can get
144030	ones without a number pad so there gets
146580	called a ten key list and it's a
148140	shortened keyboard okay you can get ones
150420	that have different colors of bodies you
154230	can get ones that have this kind of key
156000	cap you can get ones that have the
157560	printing on the top for the key cap this
159569	one actually also comes with replacement
161790	windows keys so it's got either the
164040	embossed one with the with the bubbly
165989	logo or you can put on one with the logo
167880	right here and you can get their
170190	keyboards in all four of the main Cherry
173580	key switches so that is blue black red
175739	and brown I think that pretty much
179730	covers it so thank you for checking out
