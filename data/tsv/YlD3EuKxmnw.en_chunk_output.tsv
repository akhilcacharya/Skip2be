30	this video is brought to you by the
1709	Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
5069	add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
7830	Haswell system for unbelievable overall
9960	performance welcome to my unboxing and
12630	first look at the TT esports by
14849	thermaltake mecha g1 so mecha is short
19740	for membrane because that is the kind of
22439	key switches that no I'm just kidding
24180	mecha is short for as you guys might
26970	imagine mecha a nickel so this is a
30150	fully mechanical gaming keyboard from TT
33090	sports optimized for as you may or may
35250	not have figured out by this point in
36750	time gaming so there's a few things on
39270	the packaging here that I do want to go
41190	through so multimedia keys to control
42780	audio function at instant without going
45690	to control panel very handy so you use a
47820	function button which is down there and
49680	you use some other buttons which are
51420	over here I do like audio scroll wheels
54480	but in a pinch I will definitely settle
56789	for these in fact my own keyboard does
58320	use these USB hubs for installation of
61079	other USB gaming device so it has two
63239	built-in USB ports that are in a hub as
65159	well as audio jacks for microphone and
67140	speaker out function excellent
68810	military-grade cable tough and reliable
71939	gold plated USB connector ps2 adapter
74040	for n key rollover awesome I still do
76590	like to see ps2 compatibility black
79170	cherry switches so 50 million keystrokes
81450	and finally a thousand polling a
84150	thousand Hertz polling rate is supported
86520	by this keyboard now okay
89150	normal takes marketing for that
92310	particular feature I personally took
94979	exception to because they are k TT
98670	eSports rather not Thermaltake because
101040	they are different even though they are
102570	very very closely related because right
105090	here on the front of the box it says
106729	gaming speed eight times quicker which i
110159	think is a pretty broad statement but
112530	does have some truth to it so what they
116070	mean is because the keyboard supports a
118020	1000 Hertz polling rate that is to say
120810	that the keyboard is reporting to the
123450	computer 1000 times every second versus
126869	a standard 125 Hertz polling rate the
131580	computer itself can receive the signal
133770	in up to 1/8 of the time or as little as
138540	1/8 of the time so that's what they mean
140910	it is more responsive assuming you set
143520	it up that way which you can do because
145620	it does support it but it will not make
148020	your gaming 8 times faster or anything
149970	like that so the keyboard itself has a
152610	fairly standard layout on the bottom you
155490	find 4 nice big rubber pads that don't
157890	look like they're going to slide
158820	anywhere I also see this look so this
161190	looks really nice actually I haven't
163050	seen thermal takes the system for
164970	attaching a wrist rest before but it
167430	looks like there's very little risk of
168930	these accidentally coming out and very
170880	little risk of accidentally breaking
172410	them when you pull them out because they
174570	use a like a like a breakaway a
176940	breakaway system here so when they when
179370	the prongs come out the side there's a
180660	very good chance they're going to rip
181800	off but I actually quite like this
183570	we've also got adjustable seat right
185310	here on the bottom so you can change the
186990	angle to suit your personal gaming or
189300	typing requirements and then we're going
191940	to go ahead and put the keyboard around
193290	where you are going to see the
194540	military-grade cable and this thing is
197160	truly redonkulous so for context I'm
200610	going to go grab a k70 here so this is a
203010	Corsair keyboard which doesn't contain
205110	all the same functionality mind you but
207900	you can see the actual difference in
209880	thickness between these two cables is
212100	kind of funny so the Corsair keyboard
213900	doesn't carry audio through the same
216030	cable as the as the thermal tape once
218489	the TT eSports one does TT's ports going
221130	to then remember that so speaking of the
222750	all the things that are carried by it
224550	so there's USB for the hub this is
227550	clearly labeled hub thank you for that
229680	tt's ports can you see that cool then
232350	we've got the keyboard itself which has
234600	a picture of a keyboard as well as a ps2
236880	adapter attached to it
238230	finally the pass-through for microphone
240030	and the pass-through for headphones
242100	which are clearly labeled here wouldn't
243870	mind seeing these ones green and these
245430	ones pink I do find that particularly
247050	helpful for myself but having the
249269	picture on it is definitely an
251370	acceptable alternative so next up here
254670	actually I'm going to borrow something
257880	from that other keyboard again we have
259350	the key cap remover so let's find out
260880	what Cherry MX switches we have down
262530	there remember guys
263630	genuine Cherry MX witches always say
265700	cherry on the key switch itself here and
268130	they will have color-coded switch colors
271430	that will actually correspond to how
273080	they feel so because this uses black
274970	switches it's going to have a linear
277220	feel to the press much like a cherry MX
279800	red but with a bit of a heavier key
282050	stroke so all Cherry MX switches are
284090	rated for 50 million keystrokes they all
286610	bottomed out at four millimeters and
288530	actuate at two millimeters so actually
290990	at half of the bottoming out and many
293180	gamers prefer the linear keystrokes so
295550	that is to say the red and black switch
297980	keystrokes because there is no double
301070	tap issue like you get sometimes with
302750	cherry MX blues where the actuation
304760	point is actually slightly different
306350	from the tactile feedback point so okay
309050	so what these ones will do is they tend
310550	to be potentially able to rebound a
313280	little bit faster and be more suitable
315470	for gaming whereas many typists prefer
317960	blues and browns so there you go black
321890	switches linear a bit heavier than Reds
324110	personally I like black switches but
325850	they aren't my favorite my personal
327410	favorites are Browns because they have a
328910	bit more of that tactile feedback
330050	whereas if you want something that's
332000	quite quiet you might like Cherry MX
337550	Reds or Cherry MX blacks in terms of the
340400	layout of the keyboard itself this is
342170	not the illuminated version although
343670	there is an illuminated version you've
346010	got your standard shift backspace enter
348650	and of course other Shift key over here
351020	other than that what is this thing well
353390	it's a solidly built mechanical keyboard
355640	on the back you've got that two port USB
358430	hub remember guys this is not a powered
360290	hub so you won't be plugging in
361820	something like a USB - two and a half
364100	inch external hard drive and another one
366350	or something like that because you will
367520	run out of power it's got their
369410	microphone and headphone jack it's got a
371540	TT eSports logo here as well as their
375350	battle dragon down here on the bottom
376910	and let's do our traditional flex test
380770	not bad at all now a lot of people say
383690	they don't need a mechanical keyboard
385010	they don't want a mechanical keyboard
386300	they don't want to spend particularly
388010	the money on a mechanical keyboard they
389480	are expensive but I would say let's make
392750	this week a challenge week to try new
395120	things you don't have to buy one to try
396930	you can go to a store where they happen
398490	to have them on display or you can find
400650	a friend who happens to have one who's
402330	willing to let you come try it out give
404010	yourself five or ten minutes in front of
405510	it and see if you like it now speaking
407880	of trying new things audible.com this
409890	isn't new I've talked about it before on
411720	this channel
412410	they have audiobooks which you can
414120	download you can either get a membership
415410	or you can download one at a time listen
417360	to it on your Android device or PC or in
419280	your car or whatever else the case may
420600	be
420930	and I took all of your comments last
423570	time about which audiobook I should try
425460	by the way if you want to get a free
426660	audiobook go to audible.com slash Linus
429330	and go ahead and use that link because
431250	that makes me look good
432390	so I took all of your suggestions for
434760	which book to try and I threw them all
437610	on a fire and what I decided to try was
440820	if I'm going to challenge you guys to
442980	try a different keyboard experience I'm
444630	going to try a different book experience
447000	I am going to download the first
448710	Twilight book and our audio book and I
452130	am going to listen to it
453240	it is going to take 12 hours I'm going
455880	to listen to it before I go to bed which
457410	is what I typically do with with
459170	audiobooks nowadays and it will either
462540	put me to sleep which will be good or it
464370	won't put me to sleep and it'll be
466410	surprisingly good I am prepared to be
468060	surprised and you should too about
470460	mechanical keyboard so remember guys
471840	that's audible.com slash Linus if you
473910	want to try Twilight with me or if you
477090	have sort of a different thing in mind
480840	then you could also get a different book
482250	as well so I'm going to go subject
483600	myself to that now as always guys don't
486240	forget to like the video and share it
