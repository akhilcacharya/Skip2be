0	this video is brought to you by mass
1890	drop check out the focal LX headphones
3990	at the link in the video description so
6440	a soos is pretty into these portable
10080	monitors and they are stepping up their
13349	game this is the Zen screen go we've got
17520	two signs to make sure that nobody
19710	screws up what it's called you know I
22050	mean who could screw up what a display
23760	is called if it's on a sign next to it
26670	nobody obviously and the big difference
29340	between this one and other mobile
31710	displays is not really in the spec so
34530	it's full HD
35790	so if 1920 by 1080 IPS brightness I mean
39930	it's not I shattered or anything but it
41940	looks pretty darn good certainly
44250	suitable for the coffee shop but the big
45899	difference here is that it's got a
47550	battery built in now so you can get
49710	about 4 hours of charge using your
52320	notebook with an external display when
55020	you don't have access to a plug so if
57510	you're the kind of person who is often
59399	traveling and you're you know sitting at
61379	your gate at the airport trying to get a
62969	little bit of extra work done and you
65040	don't have an outlet this could be a
67170	lifesaver especially because it's not a
69930	lot thicker than other external portable
73229	displays that we've seen in the past but
75600	what if you're looking for something
76619	kind of like that except you have like a
78869	lot of money to spend and you want like
80729	the best one well then you might be
83670	after the Asus Pro rpq 22 you see this
88470	guy right here is a twenty one point six
90689	inch 4k display
92939	so that's 204 pixels per inch with 99%
95939	coverage of dcpip 3 it's got a USB C
99689	input actually it's got 2 USB C inputs
101970	as well as micro HDMI and ok none of
107610	that sounds that impressive but wait
109409	there's more this is actually an OLED
112320	display so this is the first that I've
114990	ever even heard of using an OLED panel
117869	from the company Jay o LED and like the
122430	ones that we just looked at before it is
124500	completely detachable it is only about 8
127729	centimeters thick
130250	meter centimeters thick and this is a
132710	great opportunity to check out those
134450	viewing angles is that impressive or
137740	what and they're estimating that pricing
141860	is going to be under $1,000 which
144680	doesn't sound that amazing for like a
146750	portable monitor
147620	but is super impressive for an OLED
151490	display at this time so The Stand
155030	folds up I actually haven't seen how it
157310	folds up yet so the fact that I could
159200	figure it out on the fly
160610	it's pretty impressive at least to me
162380	and then you just go ahead you unplug it
164530	hopefully I'm allowed to do that and you
167240	throw it in the carrying case which I
168800	also haven't seen how it works exactly
170300	but theoretically it's a little
172340	something like that in bippity boppity
175100	boop you are ready to leave the suite
177230	never to be seen again oh wait after I
