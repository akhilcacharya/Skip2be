6839	books comm slash Linus CES wow it's real
13400	this is the slide from slide and joy a
18289	product that actually got backed on
20789	Kickstarter way back in 2015 they raised
24689	six hundred thousand dollars and well
26789	they haven't shipped anything yet they
29039	are clearly still hard at work on their
31920	product and they are clearly getting a
34620	lot closer they're planning to ship in
36840	spring of this year so what is the slide
41820	well it's a triple monitor solution for
46050	your laptop but unlike project Valarie
49469	which we saw last year at CES from Razer
51570	this one actually makes an ounce of
54660	sense and is similar to what I had
56730	suggested at the time that razors should
59730	probably be to be practical it's a
62309	module that actually clips on to the
65188	back of your laptop screen then plugs in
67680	with just one cable and enables you to
70710	have either a triple monitor extended
73619	desktop or with their innovative
75420	kickstand a couple of other
76950	configurations now they've got two
79290	prototypes here this year a 15 inch and
81930	a 17 inch but they're planning a 13 inch
85350	and the weight for these things which is
87210	one of the big questions for something
88860	you're expected to carry around with you
90390	is anywhere from about 1.2 kilograms to
93509	1.9 so it actually won't weigh much more
96390	than your laptop on its own so they've
99689	got three different options basic is
101369	made out of ABS and aluminum with nine
103380	color options premium is leather
105720	Alcantara wood or anodized aluminum and
108930	then they're limited edition will be
110909	available with a real carbon fiber
112619	finish or full grain leather now setting
116490	up the slide is actually surprisingly
118920	easy you take the four pads and you can
121380	put them either directly on the back of
123000	your laptop or if you have a case like
125369	with this macbook demo that we've got
127110	here you can just put them on there the
128910	kickstand can then be adjusted to
130530	whatever angle you prefer and then
132480	finally you plug in
133860	as few as one cable into your laptop so
138180	if you're using USB type-c or type a
140460	it's just one but if you're using USB 2
142830	you will probably need two because of
145560	the lower power output from USB 2 now
148650	the kickstand was a real engineering
150300	challenge because it had to be flexible
151980	enough to be mounted on anything from a
153540	very thin to a very thick laptop or even
156990	be left standing by itself when you take
159690	your laptop with you so it can be left
162900	flat then if you just want to take out
164880	one of your screens and duplicate your
167100	view for the person sitting across from
168600	you this is great for business meetings
170790	or consultations or it can be folded
173220	down to help support the additional
175260	weight of the extra screens in a multi
177780	monitor single user configuration or
180080	with up to 3-way sharing if you've got a
183180	group of people that all need to be
185130	looking at the same thing and the last
187140	functionality it enables is because it
189000	can stand alone you can actually get any
191190	size of the slide and pair it with any
193950	size laptops you could buy a 15-inch
196470	slide with your 13-inch laptop if you
198660	want that extra real estate when you're
200790	docked but you just want a smaller
202860	device when you're out and about so the
205080	productivity implications are huge with
208290	mobile devices getting more powerful and
210360	more functional every year we're finally
213060	getting to the point where the
213989	bottleneck really is screen real estate
216630	just like what happened on the desktop
219269	10-15 years ago so it doesn't take a ton
222299	of imagination to think of what you
224250	could do extra work wise entertainment
227010	wise with two more 1080p IPS displays so
231510	the final ones are going to be made by
233010	LG they're gonna run at 60 Hertz but
236299	before you get too excited about the 60
238560	Hertz it should be noted they're using
239910	the USB protocol rather than DisplayPort
242580	so I wouldn't expect to be gaming on
245040	them with that said if they're
246900	successful who knows what the future
249360	will hold
249959	so pricing goes from 350 euro for the
252540	basic all the way up to 850 for the
255750	limited edition and it's going to be
257250	$100 more once they're actually shipping
259769	but for my part I see this as being a
262770	lot more practical than a laptop with
265050	built in multiple displays because it
266789	gives me the
267360	option to just take my you know nice
270210	light mobile device out with me or pack
273930	an epic mobile workstation powerhouse
279030	machine thing if let's say I needed to
282960	get some accounting done on-the-go
