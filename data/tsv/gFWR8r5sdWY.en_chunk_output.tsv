11420	welcome to a long overdue unboxing and
14759	review this is the ducky shine 3 and as
17640	with any unboxing we're gonna start with
19800	the box itself and the content so the
22170	first thing you find is cardboard it's
24150	oh wait no there's actually a keyboard
27119	in here that'll be important later in
28769	all likelihood we've also got some
30029	accessories including but not limited to
32940	a WASD set of key cap replacements
37350	alright we've also got a key cap puller
40530	in order to apply said replacements if
42750	we're not happy with the blacks limbs
43890	that are already on there we've also got
45809	a USB a 2 mini B cable that's wrapped up
48960	in a nice little cable management thing
50160	happens to be gold-plated although that
51600	doesn't really matter and we've got a
53940	replacement space bar if we don't like
55739	the snake graphic on the stock space bar
58320	last but not least so I guess we are
60030	limited to the things that I just found
61649	we have a registration thing for your
64019	warranty as well as a user's manual
66299	which you will need so the keyboard
70140	itself I mean what is there to say that
72900	every other reviewer in the world hasn't
74820	said about ducky the build quality is
76909	immaculate there's almost no flex to the
79860	thing whatsoever it is extremely heavy
82650	the keys have a very ah satisfying sound
86640	to them just like you'd expect with a
87930	mechanical keyboard but it's even better
90000	with a solidly built mechanical keyboard
92220	and of course there's the stuff that you
93479	can't see such as the dual layer PCB
96240	that's inside and the UV coated laser
98939	printed ABS key cap so those are pretty
101820	darn good as far as key caps go there
104189	are better ones out there but they're
105360	generally considered to be aftermarket
107070	options on the back of the unit we find
109229	4 rubber pads so that it doesn't slip
111689	around on you as well as 2 little risers
114240	if you prefer to have a bit more of an
115799	angle to your keyboard we've also got
117930	cable routing options for the detachable
120689	USB cable so it can come out straight to
122759	the right or to the left whatever you
124380	prefer we also find our serial number on
126659	the serial number on the back as well as
129090	some dip switches more on those in just
132060	a moment alright so while this might
133830	not be the most user-friendly way to
135840	implement different you know control
138030	changes what these four little dip
139770	switches do is they disable the Windows
141990	key so it doesn't have like a gaming
143550	mode button on the front you can
144690	actually do that with a dip switch on
146100	the back you can actually swap control
148980	and capslock you can swap windows and
152790	alt placements and if you want to to be
156330	adventurous you can put it into demo
158070	mode which might be more useful for
159810	shopkeepers and less useful for
161850	individuals who are buying thing what
163440	demo mode does is it cycles through all
165660	the different lighting modes and stuff
167040	like that without actually any USB data
169440	going back and forth it just makes it
171060	take in power so it doesn't actually
172320	work in demo mode
173700	alright Linus it's a ducky so we know
175440	it's extremely well built but tell me
177450	about the features alright so it's
179940	available in either a 104 key or a 10
183630	key list that is to say without the
185220	number pad layout it's available in a
187140	variety of colors although we've only
188580	got blue here today so blue red green
191280	white magenta and orange for the LED
193980	backlights and it's available in the
196020	kind of the standard four key switch
197820	type so that's brown red black and blue
202200	that nice clicky sound it has shortcuts
204540	for media keys although I think what
206459	ducky means by that is volume up volume
208080	down and mute because there's no play
209820	pause or or track skip or anything like
211830	that it also has an ease are classic
213570	calculator computer email and Internet
216900	shortcuts in the top right actually
218250	gotta love that other than that most of
220800	the labels on the keys are just for
222540	controlling lighting and other advanced
224670	functionalities such as changing the
226620	repeat rate or how fast characters will
229530	appear when you hold down a key and
231350	changing the repeat delay or how long
234750	until repeating begins in practice a
237269	repeat delay above about 2x caused me to
240090	double press spacebar just while I'm
242100	typing but your mileage may vary on
243720	these very cool functionality there
245220	either way particularly for gaming over
247769	all the configuration is completely
249810	driverless but you will need the manual
252750	to set it up it's not too bad though I
254400	figured most of it out in about five
256649	minutes alright but that's just the
258839	regular features what about the lighting
260608	this is a shine well we'll start with
262680	the seven different modes which you
264660	cycle through by using function
267100	and s10 number one which you just saw
270130	was a hundred percent on that
271150	self-explanatory you can adjust the
272860	brightness down here with the up and
274240	down arrows and function and that's
275470	about it in breathing you can use the
277810	arrow keys to adjust both the speed and
279900	the maximum brightness of the breathing
282460	effect the range is very wide and it
284590	should please pretty much anyone in wave
287170	mode you can adjust the speed of the
289810	wave but not the actual brightness of
292540	the way so that's what you can see right
293710	now and in snake marquee mode this one I
296500	actually quite like you can change just
299040	the speed of the snake but not the
301450	brightness and it crawls around on the
302860	keyboard like that in reactive mode you
305710	can change both the pressed and non
308110	pressed brightness so you can either
310180	have the keys turn off and then fade
312880	back in as you type or you can have them
315490	be off and then turn on and fade away as
317980	you type I think this one and ripple are
319750	my personal favorites
320920	speaking of ripple both it and Aurora
323770	are cool modes that send out patterns
326380	when you press on particular keys you
329560	can adjust the speed of either effect
331300	but only ripple can have the brightness
333640	adjusted so this one right here is
335650	Aurora which always runs on full
338320	brightness you can see it sends out
339820	horizontal waves now the spacebar is a
342490	bit of a unique situation it only has or
345910	rather it has one blue LED which matches
348490	the color of your keyboard and it has
349870	two RGB LEDs one on either side of the
354010	blue one so you can change the color
356320	effects of the spacebar by using the
358810	insert home and page up along with
361090	function to achieve pretty much any
363280	color you could possibly want so it's
365260	our G and B and you can mix them in
368530	whatever way you find most pleasing or
371110	turn those ones off and then another
372940	option that you'll have by using the
374740	custom configurations here so let's go
377710	ahead and press function record one
380680	where we can turn on or off whichever
383290	keys on the keyboard we want so we can
385570	turn on everything let's say okay let's
388450	say for example you guys imagined so
390910	function record one let's say you guys
393220	imagined that I turned on everything
395410	except the spacebar so I can either have
397540	that middle one illuminated
399039	or not illuminated and it's totally up
400749	to me whether to have it at some of the
402520	original color or none of it at all and
404949	then you can recall those by using so
407229	let's go ahead and stop recording by
408969	just pressing function cm 1 or cm 2 and
411849	that's on the f11 and f12 keys now if
415270	you're anything like me and particularly
416680	the first time around if you get just
418629	overwhelmed at some point you just want
420369	to go back to the dock all you have to
422499	do is hold down both of the windows keys
424419	for 3 seconds the keyboard flashes and
427119	boom you are back to factory settings
429219	and you can start tinkering again so the
431439	conclusion for this is pretty simple if
433059	you're looking for an extremely
434649	well-built keyboard that's available in
436659	a wide variety of configurations at
438639	least some of which you're down to find
440770	pleasing and you want the best lighting
443379	features then I guess just go buy one
445689	with that said the shine 3 is not cheap
448629	it's well over $100 and given the spotty
451689	retail store availability you'll likely
453969	have to get it shipped to you so you're
455439	probably looking at a hundred and fifty
457180	dollar plus or minus investment it's
460209	probably going to last forever however
462189	so as long as you have the discipline to
464409	not run and buy more mechanical
466719	keyboards it really is addictive then
470469	you may be able to justify the expense
472330	for the faster more satisfying typing
475269	experience that a mechanical keyboard
476589	provides and you can treat yourself to
479019	one that is particularly awesome as
481479	always guys like this video if you liked
483999	it dislike it if you just like to leave
485199	a comment let me know what your thoughts
486639	on mechanical keyboards in general and
488409	the shine 3 in particular and as always
