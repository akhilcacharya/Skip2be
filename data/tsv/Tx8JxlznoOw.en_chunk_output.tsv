6620	welcome to my much demanded unboxing of
9660	the Vengeance m60 so this actually is
12420	not my first encounter with first
14820	there's new gaming series mice although
17490	it is one of my first encounters with
19710	what looks like a horrible difficult to
22619	open package that actually I broken is
26490	not difficult to open or horrible at all
29519	so course there has in their infinite
32250	wisdom figured out a way to do a
34559	clamshell plastic package where the
38040	product just comes out like that like
40440	that's easier than like removing Darth
42329	Vader's mask that's awesome incredible
45270	okay so now okay I'm done talking about
47850	how great the packaging is now let's
49710	move on to the product so this is
51180	Corsairs first real entry into the
54260	gaming peripheral all cash shouldn't say
56879	it's their first real entry into the
58170	gaming peripheral space because they do
60449	have their had they're very successful
62250	headsets and very successful speakers
65040	under their belts already but this is
67979	their first crack at a human interface
70470	device so a mouse or keyboard so the m60
73979	K 60 M 90 and K 90 are two series of
77700	products so the 60 series products are
79590	more geared for fps and a little bit
81180	more about why the m60 is for fps and
83759	the 90 series are more for MMO now in
87390	terms of some of the specs they're quite
88680	similar so both the m60 which we have
90900	here and the kasich and the m9 t have a
94200	full unibody aluminum construction so
97079	you can see it does add some weight to
99030	the mouse but personally I prefer
100439	heavier mouse anyway I use a fully
102810	loaded g9 with all of the weight the
105450	weight packs in it at work and I really
107430	do like that so it does make it a little
109619	bit heavy but not unreasonably so and
111509	then you also have adjustable weights
113700	here on the bottom so you can actually
115649	adjust not only the overall weight of
117509	the mouse but also where the weight is
119520	located in the mouse so they both have
122009	the same 5700 DPI sensor unibody design
125189	they've also got the same overall kind
128729	of ergonomic design and feel so the
131099	difference is that the m9 t has
133450	Tata buttons over here whereas the k60
135970	goes for more of a more of an optimized
138760	sort of layout you don't need a ton of
140200	buttons for FPS but what you do need is
142300	your back and forward whether you want
144489	to bind it to grenade throwing or
145840	whatever else the case may be
147099	you need your sensitivity adjustments
149110	which are up here you need a that's nice
152440	Russian was telling me that this mouse
154510	feature the heavy duty scroll wheel and
156190	I can I can definitely see what he means
157750	by that because it has a very distinct
159280	click it has a very good click when
161980	you're actually pressing on it as well
163450	so it is very comfortable to use and
165610	then what they've also added is a
167049	dedicated sniper button so what that
168819	does is allows you to figure out a DPI
171430	that you're more comfortable with when
172989	you're zoomed in really close up to
175060	something so as soon as you scope in
177099	you're gonna want to go ahead press that
178810	button and that's going to dramatically
180280	reduce your sensitivity so you have more
182530	control when you are zoomed in all the
184690	way so as we've come to expect with
186819	Corsair this mouse has hold on I'm just
189099	gonna put it down kind of gently
191170	somewhere so that I don't scratch the
192940	non-slip or non-slip I always call them
195430	non-slip no no intentionally slippery
198400	feet on the bottom of the mouse in terms
201069	of length the cable is just over one
204220	Linus arm span and has a USB termination
207880	which we pretty much we take for granted
210040	these days as we've come to expect from
212049	Corsair we've got a nice rugged braided
215560	cable so that should be more difficult
217780	to get caught on things than a non
220209	braided cable hold on a second what else
226840	we got on here so I just want to make
228340	sure I didn't miss anything here's
229389	something that's cool it actually has
231190	besides an advanced sensor and I've
233290	already used both the m60 and the m9 t
236319	in a real-world scenario really like the
238780	way I tracked some mites regardless of
240880	what kind of a dpi they respect for sort
244030	of feel better than others some feel
245799	more accurate than others I've actually
247090	tried the m9 t already on a variety of
249549	different surfaces including a cloth pad
251440	a hard pad a more textured hard pad as
254500	well as just on the tech tips table over
256870	there on a table cloth and I didn't have
258820	any difficulty with it on any of those
260649	surfaces some in particular you go and
263020	you use it on a cloth pad it feels great
264640	you go and you throw it on
266050	hard Pat like something like I've got an
267970	old SteelSeries SX that's a discontinued
270250	mousepad now but it's my personal
272050	favorite and I've taken mice that
273610	perform great on cloth I've thrown them
275259	on there and it it glides great you know
277870	great aluminum mousepad but the tracking
279520	feels funny like it'll it'll judder
281680	around or it'll it'll kind of not detect
284860	just right what I'm going in a straight
286210	line it'll move in not quite a straight
287770	line drives me absolutely crazy so this
289479	one seems to track very well on a
290979	variety of surfaces in terms of the
293530	slippy feed on the bottom of it we've
295120	got very very good coverage so at the
298449	back on the sides of the back on the
300969	sides at the front so you're pretty much
302830	gonna be covered no matter how you rest
305289	on your mouse speaking of how you vest
307479	on your mouse this is what a lot of
308949	people ask me ever since we did that
311050	ergonomics guide on my NCIX comm channel
313330	what a lot of people ask me is what kind
314889	of a mouse is it is a pom mouse is an
316629	applaud mouse is it a fingertip Mouse
318729	and I'd say if I had to pick one for
320740	these guys this is more of a claw Mouse
322360	although what they've done here at the
324099	back you see this shape right here is
326889	they've created a way that you can
328870	actually kind of palm this Mouse if you
331419	have smaller hands like I do so you see
333370	the way that rests right in my palm
335349	there so I can either rest my palm there
337960	or I can lift up a little bit more and I
340659	can use it as more of a fingertip style
342819	of mouse the buttons have I'd say about
345759	an average travel distance before they
348370	actuate I've had mice that I've used in
350440	the past that I find are more like a
353800	hair-trigger I particularly find that on
355840	Razer mice they tend to be quite
357159	sensitive so you put a little bit of too
358810	much pressure on the right side of the
360159	mouse boom you click all of a sudden I
361960	personally don't have that great fine
364240	control with my fingers for clicking so
367150	I prefer something with a little bit of
369039	a heavier mouse button so bear that in
371319	mind you guys if you're gonna go with
373029	the m60 I'd say it's about average
375240	something that I could use comfortably
377289	but I wouldn't mind if it was a little
379779	bit heavier as well um let me see what
383020	else we got here I don't think you're
384340	missing too much ah yeah the Russians
387069	reminded me that you know what I'll talk
390009	about that after because others
391300	other stuff here's pool so side-mounted
393550	sniper bot and aluminum frame and bass
395110	for improved rigidity and mass
396460	distribution tracking up to 165 inches
399220	per second with up to 30 G's of
400659	acceleration an automatic frame rate
402190	control solid metal weighted scroll
404409	wheel rubber I scroll surface okay so
405909	we've got all of that stuff so far but
407830	what we haven't talked about is the
409750	adjustable lift distance with five
411430	selectable levels to fit your style of
413259	play and the fact that the mouse also
415599	detects when it's being lifted and is
417430	not going to move around
419500	once you've lifted it off the table
421389	which is a very cool feature and
422979	something that can be the bane the
425440	killer of otherwise very legitimate very
428770	good gaming mice is if you run into that
431139	problem where oh I've gone over here I
433060	need to lift it up and it tracks you a
434860	little bit back to the right as you try
436690	to get back to center so you shouldn't
438849	have that problem and I have not had
440319	that problem in using the m60 or rather
443409	the m90 which is the same sensor so in
446409	using the m90 so far so why don't we
449199	just try to have a bit of a close-up
450669	here so you can see it's what it looks
453759	like from the front there's that
455259	aluminum frame so this even though it
457870	doesn't really look like it's connected
459130	anything is actually part of the unibody
460779	design you can see it's joined right
462219	here and then it comes all the way out
464650	here folds up at the back and that is
466840	what supports the palm rest at the back
469599	of the mouse right there it looks kind
471880	of bare bones but like I don't mean okay
474819	I don't mean bare bones it looks kind of
476319	like exposed and like you might sort of
478960	fall fall through the actual covering of
482229	the mouse and it might be uncomfortable
483819	but it's actually not because all the
485440	places where you would normally touch
487330	are covered with their kind of a
489879	non-slip rubberized grip ii coating so
493270	it's actually a little bit more textured
495069	on the sides which is a very nice touch
497560	than it is on the top so on the top it's
499569	quite smooth and on the sides it's got
501520	quite a lot of texture so what actually
503440	here you can you can see my skin
504940	naturally rubbing off on the texture on
506500	the side so what that means is that when
508840	you go to lift the mouse you have with
510789	very minimal pressure on the mouse due
513190	to the curvature of the mouse as well as
515589	due to the texture on the sides very
518019	minimal difficulty holding it up with a
520208	thumb and a pink
521510	finger whereas it also isn't rough on
524059	the top so that's it's not rough on the
526730	top that's good so thank you for
529970	checking out my unboxing of the
531320	Vengeance m60 don't forget to subscribe
533330	- tech tips from our unboxings reviews
535070	and other computer videos and also don't
537890	forget it has user selectable reporting
539780	rate of 125 Hertz 240 here's 500 Hertz
542630	and 1000 Hertz which I pretty much
545420	assumed it had and I assumed you would
547370	know but since it's on the box I might
549020	as well mention it anyway
