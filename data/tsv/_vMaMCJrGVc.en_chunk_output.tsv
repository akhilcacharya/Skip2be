6589	so here's another product from Sudoku
9360	which actually is very similar to the
12330	air keyboard the one that I looked at
13980	last time however there are a couple of
16859	key differences between the air keyboard
18869	and the air keyboard Conqueror for PC
22560	and ps3 so one is that this guy works
25170	with PC and ps3 and the other is that
28949	instead of being purely an air mouse and
31439	I'll explain a little bit what an air
32668	Mouse's are just a moment as well as a
34890	keyboard this one is also a dual analog
39379	gamepad so check this out so you can see
42210	they've built in the X square triangle
45450	and circle logos that use that play Sony
48600	PlayStation uses but they've also
50430	numbered them for PC use you've also got
52739	your d-pad up here actually feels fairly
55079	well built - it's got kind of a
56550	rubberized grip ii thing going on on the
58289	sides here this side and this side and
60690	then these have also a bit of a textured
63600	rubberized finish to the top of them and
66080	what do we got here so you got your
68010	power you got your left and right click
70530	I like the way they've implemented left
72420	and right click on this one versus the
74040	way it was done on the other one where
75390	this was left click and this was right
77400	click so I mean that kind of worked but
79080	I think I do prefer this I have to
81479	wonder if you can use the analog stick
83130	as a mouse I wonder if they mention that
85259	on the specification so let's see oh
88130	this is cool - okay so here why don't we
90689	go through what they have to say about
91530	it so frequency range ok 2.4 gigahertz
94619	gotcha
95310	built in lithium ion rechargeable
96689	battery so the other one you have to
98700	change the batteries yourself this one
100229	looks like it charges via USB it shows
103049	really really nice what else we got here
105479	operation time greater than 20 hours of
107970	constant use which is awesome charging
110340	time is three to four hours effective
111570	range up to ten meters I'm inclined to
113040	believe that based on how well the
115290	sudoku air keyboard has been working for
117420	me so far it's actually replaced all of
119790	my other devices for my HTPC including
122909	my phantom lap board including my what
126780	was that brand I had an a/c oh I have
129000	one of those as you blew too
130350	keyboards it was about this big had a
131700	trackpad on the side I was using one of
133380	those for a little while and that one I
135510	just kind of I gave up on once I started
138270	using this guy hold the other one of
140520	these and what else did I try you know
144240	what it's just it's just a size thing
146790	because for me having a keyboard on the
149220	couch was just too inconvenient even if
151110	it hadn't attached to trackpad and
152550	especially something like the Phantom
154350	lap board where it had a separate Mouse
155670	it was just me it wasn't that it wasn't
158010	really very elegant unto a room for two
159870	pieces whereas for this I can just pick
162000	up one thing so the way the air Mouse
163770	works is you just kind of position it
165450	somewhere and it'll zero itself and then
167610	you go okay I want to move down and want
168870	to move up I wanna move left I want to
170130	move right so you kind of position
171600	things it's reasonably accurate although
173400	this is not a super ultra premium brand
176790	by any stretch of the imagination and so
178830	you know it wasn't necessarily what you
181020	might expect out of someone like an
182610	apple if they were to release a product
184440	like that but it is accurate enough that
186960	I could sit on my couch about 1215 feet
189480	away from my TV and I can quite easily
192210	navigate this is at 1080p so we're
194340	talking small Mouse pointers and small
196680	boxes to hit when I'm closing programs
198480	or opening up a file or doing whatever
200460	else it is I want to do and then all I
202560	do is I take it I put it down on the
204120	counter then the mouse goes away I watch
205950	my movie and it's very very convenient
208290	and the size is perfect cuz it fits in a
209970	drawer you just grab it use it you can
211950	type very easily so the full QWERTY
213630	keyboard includes very almost every
216660	button you need once again with this
218070	model so you got even F keys I don't
219810	think the other one has F keys that's
221520	outstanding
222960	caps lock you got shift over here the
225660	other one had two shifts so I'm actually
227610	going to kind of Miss that other shift
228960	but this one they've put in a Windows
230280	key here other one has a Windows key up
232920	at the top somewhere so they have
234570	changed the layout a little bit but I
235830	don't see any real problems one thing
238050	that I'm curious to see if they've
239580	addressed is the no they haven't
241800	addressed this I would like to see the
243630	home world more like in the center and
245340	if they compress the keyboard a little
246870	bit on this side that would be nice
248040	because otherwise you're kind of you're
249570	reaching over a little bit more with
250740	your right hand but as long as you sort
252540	of remember and you don't try to just
254040	touch type from them from a center like
256079	this then it's not that big of a deal I
258720	think I do like the keyboard on the air
261029	keyboard itself but if you want the
263160	additional convenience
264000	so have a feel for having a gamepad
265440	built into it I guess this isn't a bad
267000	trade-off I like the way they've done
268560	the ergonomics as well so they've got
270240	kind of a contour thing here that is
272190	very comfortable it kind of sits between
273930	these two fingers here if you're using
275850	the gamepad portion and then you just
277710	hold it between these two fingers if you
279450	want to actually type on the keyboard
280770	the device is quite light sorry my
283800	assistant got attacked by a cat so that
287430	was not that ideal sounds like there's
291420	something inside this one maybe it was
292920	damaged during shipping but I'll try it
294810	out and all I'll let you guys know if it
296580	doesn't work that's probably the best
299010	approach to take I have no idea what
301980	this ports for okay maybe that's
304650	something to do with Playstation because
306000	I'm not much of a console guy so I don't
307590	always I don't always know these things
309540	but there's you charging I'm going to go
311520	ahead and throw the battery in here so
312900	it's got one of these covers on it too
316310	they might pull this you could possibly
320940	pull that no you want me to pull that if
322830	I want to remove the battery after I put
325440	it in there we go
326340	and then the last thing we've got here
330000	no batteries loaded look at that is
331800	powered on already
332729	hey you got a blue light in there
334200	showing you is powered on and last but
336150	not least we've got the charging cable
337979	which is just your standard USB a 2 mini
340050	beep and then finally we've got the
342210	wireless dongle which as I mentioned
343830	before with mine the range is excellent
346350	the reliability is excellent compared to
348360	some of the other ones that I've used in
350400	the past that I haven't been nearly as
352290	impressed with so thank you for checking
354419	out my unboxing and first look at the oh
356940	the shaking stun oh no it's not at the
360240	Siddiq Oh err keyboard conquer don't
