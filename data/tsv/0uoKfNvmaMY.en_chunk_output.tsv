269	so today the cameraman is very tired and
2760	he'll be sitting in a chair and I'll be
4259	standing for a change so we're doing a
6000	little bit of role reversal but he won't
7859	be appearing in front of the camera and
9360	I won't be behind it today we have a
11550	very exciting product to unbox it is a
13620	blizzard license product it is made by
16379	steel series and it comes with World of
20189	Warcraft Cataclysm branding on it do you
23189	think you can guess which product it is
24810	yes it is finally the updated Wow Mouse
28199	now the original Wow Mouse was a fairly
31140	similar looking product but the
34309	improvements that have been made are all
36570	really cool so let's start with pinning
40800	up we've got a little magnetic clasp
42329	here so that's what closes a package
44250	about like a cool sort of packaging on
46170	this where it's like burned away and
48450	then you pull it open you can see
50789	there's a bunch more information here
52230	covered in Blizzard artwork of course
54600	which is always awesome alright develop
57270	for world of warcraft players by
58890	blizzard and steel series cooperatively
61289	the Cataclysm MMO gaming mouse invokes
64619	the iconic imagery of death wing the
67409	destroyer leader of the Black
68820	Dragonflight and okay so this is just
70619	marketing spiel all right that's not
72270	going to tell us too much here we go
73560	multi platform compatibility Mac and PC
76439	just like blizzards games game library
79350	official in-game supports you can bind
81390	all 14 buttons within the game so it's
84330	built right into WoW support for this
86430	mouse Advance macros with 14 fully
89009	programmable buttons we have onboard
90990	memory to store your custom settings
92790	advanced illumination with 16 million
95640	colors and 4 intensity settings very
97650	cool
98610	the original Wow mouse had like the same
100470	sort of deal where you can change the
101880	color of it and up to 10 unique profiles
105079	linked to the armory your custom
107700	profiles link to the armory so I'm
108990	guessing that's 4 different characters
110030	all right then let's actually have a
112530	look at the back of the box here and
114290	here we go so frames per second that is
116909	the FPS that can be recorded by the
118560	mouse's 11.75 self-adjusting okay inches
121979	per second is 150 counts per inch is 92
125399	50 40 so the CPI seems to be quite a bit
128250	higher than the original Wow Mouse
129568	acceleration true 16-bit these are all
132540	very highly technical
133680	specifications I mean you got to
134970	understand SteelSeries has been building
136590	mice for a long time this is not a
138629	cheesy like Wow randant product that is
141750	just designed to sort of take a cheap
143670	mouse throw a label on it and sell a
145620	bunch of mice they've actually been
147299	building gaming peripherals for as long
149610	as we've had awesome professional level
153450	peripherals so see if there's anything
158640	else that I want to cover that is talked
161370	about on the back of the box now the
163920	software for the original WoW Mouse was
165750	pretty good and as far as I know we're
167609	using a very similar software layout but
169799	what I'll have to do is I'll have to
171540	update you guys once I have a chance to
173760	actually use the mouse so today we're
176010	going to focus on the physical aspects
178500	of it so first of all what we have
180299	included in the package yeah cameraman
182010	couldn't care less but it's basically a
184079	little thing that tells you to download
185760	the latest drivers you know Oh Quick
187980	Start Guide Wow okay you might find some
189599	more info in here it's quite thick which
191700	I guess is because there's a lot of
193049	languages to configure the mouse you
194730	launch the Gaming Mouse software via the
196620	Start menu just speed and sensitivity
199199	you can program the buttons you can
200730	adjust the color intensity and pulsation
202889	effects so it does have the pulsation
204900	that the original wah Mouse had you can
206879	use up to 10 profiles with 14 different
208470	buttons and let me see buttons and
215609	default settings here we go so here they
218340	map on all the buttons okay well there's
221609	not a whole lot in there actually it is
222810	a Quick Start Guide all right so let's
224310	have a look at the well mouse itself
225750	first thing is it's an MMO Mouse so it's
228329	all about buttons let's show you guys
230280	where all of the buttons on this Mouse
232079	are so we'll start on this side we have
233909	one two three four five buttons on the
237269	left side so I'm not going to count this
238919	one I'll count that as a top button five
240510	here next we have one two three four
244919	five six seven eight on the top and then
250769	finally on this side we have an
253650	additional one so that is a total of 14
256858	buttons on this Mouse now personally I
259829	did not find the ergonomics of the
262289	original amount while Mouse to be quite
264150	to my liking it was more of
266560	a more of an ambidextrous shape so it
270100	wasn't really fitted for a right hand
272500	whereas the new Wow Mouse the Cataclysm
275260	mouse actually borrows a little of the
276910	shape from my personal favorite Mouse
279160	the iqari laser so you've got this same
281620	shape here to rest your two fingers on
284080	and then over on the other side the
286330	thumb buttons are actually in a much
288940	better position for someone like me to
291430	actually reach them the original Wow
293139	Mouse had some of the buttons were a
295060	little bit weird like you could kind of
297010	accidentally hit one when you mean to
298540	hit the other because they were all on
299710	kind of a single button and it was more
302110	like a rocker switch and I didn't really
303760	like that all that much but this is a
305440	much much better layout so these are
307600	going to be your back and forward
308620	buttons and windows and I guess the
309880	other ones are mostly intended for games
311590	use alright so the overall finish of it
313960	now this is not quite a production
315760	sample Mouse but this should be pretty
318190	close to what we're expecting so it's
319930	kind of a a worn armor look finish to
323080	the to the top of the mouse and then
325210	this is final so this is a pretty much a
327370	steel series safe staple this kind of
329470	rubberized grip II feeling thing okay so
333220	let's flip the mouse over here we find
335440	the SteelSeries gaming great engine as
337510	well as nice large slippy pads on the
340000	bottom of the mouse so it's going to
341770	take you a long time to wear those guys
343600	out we have a very nice-looking braided
346419	yum cameraman wants to see that I guess
347950	we have a very nice braided cable here
350460	so you can see that they're using a very
352810	high-quality sleeving when the cameraman
354430	finishes looking at the gaming great
357010	engine alright so they use a great
358930	quality cable sleeving you can't see
360639	through that to the court at all and
362050	then we'll have a look at sort of how
363760	long it is
364539	so yeah it's about wow it's actually
367780	really low in cord and then we've got a
370500	gold plated USB connector at the end to
374320	make sure that you're always making good
375910	connection between the mouse and the USB
378700	port
381100	a couple more views of the most itself
384100	because it really does look pretty sharp
387400	so what I want to show you guys and I
389470	guess I'll do an upcoming video on this
391090	is I want to show you guys the driver
392560	configuration as well as the what it
395020	looks like with all the lighting effects
396610	enabled so don't forget to subscribe to
398500	line this tech tips for follow up on
400540	this most more unboxings more reviews
