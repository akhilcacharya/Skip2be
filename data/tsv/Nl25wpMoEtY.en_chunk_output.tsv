0	a mouse like so many things it's all
2520	about the feeling in your hand is it
4799	satisfying is it fatiguing is it erotic
8039	for the logitech g502 proteus core
10410	tunable Gaming Mouse boy is that ever a
12780	mouthful the answers fortunately are yes
15089	no no and did you seriously put that
18029	double entendre in their hotspot shield
27119	service makes your internet browsing
28410	safer more secure and fully private
31080	click now to learn more we'll start with
33090	the shape after so many years of loyalty
35760	to the classic Logitech performance
37770	mouth shape that I've personally been
39510	using off and on since 2004 I was
42360	worried that Logitech had gone too far
44910	out into left-field and screwed things
47039	up I was pretty worried about the g502
49920	is ergonomic swen I'd only seen pictures
51930	of it now that I've actually used it
53850	it's clear to me that they really
55530	haven't changed much other than to
57030	extend the thumb rest add some
58980	much-needed extra buttons improve the
61350	feel with soft touch on the back and a
63300	super satisfying textured rubber on the
65280	sides add a blue LED G logo and
68130	otherwise just give it a very sexy
69869	makeover the new buttons have been very
72510	thoughtfully laid out and unlike most
74549	gaming mice I'm able to comfortably
76409	reach each and every one of them without
78509	altering my grip the default mappings
80670	which of course you can change in
81960	software are left right and middle click
84150	scroll left and scroll right from the
86250	mouse wheel tilt profile switching
87960	behind the scroll wheel the toggle
89850	button dpi up and down to the left of
92250	the index finger forward and back in
94049	your browser above the thumb and shift
96060	just in front of the thumb this lets you
98070	hold down a button to temporarily change
100470	to your assigned shift dpi for more
102659	accurate sniping the one thing that
104820	can't be reprogrammed at least right now
107040	is scroll up and scroll down something
110070	that some gamers will definitely miss
112229	but this is actually not my biggest
114450	complaint about the scroll wheel first
117060	good stuff though Logitech has vastly
119250	improved the implementation of their
121110	free spinning mode versus the g9s bottom
124740	mounted toggle by moving the
126119	aforementioned toggle to the top of the
127619	mouse so switching between the normal
129470	clicky mode versus the spreadsheet
132239	friendly free spin mode
133420	now superfast the backward step on the
136360	scroll wheel though is the metallic
137920	finish combined with a fairly heavy
140830	click in clicky mode that cost my finger
143319	to slip quite frequently when trying to
145690	scroll if I end up keeping this mouse as
148150	my daily driver I will be looking for
150250	something to cover it with to improve
151930	the situation I don't like this at all
154150	and it's easily my biggest criticism of
156730	an otherwise outstanding design on
159489	tomorrow things I do like Logitech
161560	doesn't name the exact mechanical micro
163630	switches they're using in the left and
164890	right buttons but they rate them at
166930	twenty million clicks and they have a
168580	very satisfying not too heavy not so
172060	light you accidentally hit them all the
174069	time like that bloody Death Adder 2013
175900	weight to them the other buttons are
178030	each individually tuned so that the ones
180220	that are intended to be hit by leaning
182019	on them are light and very easy to press
184030	and the ones that are intended to be
185500	pushed like a normal button are heavier
187420	what a nice touch kudos to Logitech for
189640	that one
190060	to wrap up ergonomics I'll say this like
192910	seemingly everyone else writing reviews
195190	on Amazon of this Mouse I loved the g9
198400	shape and performance in fact my clearly
201730	well used g9 cord finally started
204760	flaking out recently and I've been
206260	considering buying one on ebay or
207700	something and like everyone else I think
210579	the best way I can describe the g502 is
213160	to call it a worthy successor to the g9
215470	and that really is high praise coming
217299	from me for my small hands I I guess
220630	they'd be medium if I was a lady the
222820	increased height doesn't affect the claw
224890	ish grip that I use and the increased
227170	length doesn't bother me one bit because
229660	I click almost as easily in the middle
231820	of the left and right buttons as I can
233650	at the end of them the fact that it has
235870	more buttons and I can easily reach them
238209	all is a huge bonus and I think my only
240430	real complaint aside from that slick
241959	material on the scroll wheel is that
243609	it's a touch on the heavy side even
245410	without the included handy dandy weights
247890	however well implemented that system
250989	with its handy-dandy magnetic cover on
253269	the bottom might be another thing that
255370	might be contributing to the heavy feel
256930	of the mouse is the unusually thick also
259389	heavy cord that drags more than I'm used
261608	to when moving it around get yourself a
263830	mouse cord anchor of some sort to go
265419	along with your g502 for
267070	sure here's the one I use at home so on
269770	to performance stuff on the bottom of
271600	the mouse we've got slippy feet rated
273310	for a massive 250 kilometers of travel
275950	distance before they're supposed to wear
277150	out and then powered by a 32-bit ARM
279550	processor under the hood is what
281440	Logitech's calling the highest
283360	performance optical sensor on the market
285760	with zero acceleration zero smoothing or
288220	filtering and zero pixel rounding dam
291220	other than a couple dissenters on the
293590	forums who claim there's some
294760	acceleration based on like moving your
296950	hand and thinking feeling the
298330	acceleration the general consensus is
300400	that this is one seriously bad ass piece
303250	of gear the sensor goes from 200 to
306090	12,000 dpi and 50 dpi increments without
309640	any interpolation extrapolation or other
312700	tomfoolery which is something that most
314980	people like that the very high end will
317650	never leverage but does speak to the
319840	overall accuracy of the optics of the
322090	mouse now I lack the testing equipment
324370	to validate Logitech's claims here but
326350	what I can say is that having recently
328420	switched to a perfect sensor Mouse the
331390	g502 delivers an equally enjoyable
333640	experience at least now most of the
336490	software stuff I briefly covered in the
338290	rest of the video but there are a few
339250	things I want to point out specifically
341260	all of the changes are applied to the
343570	hardware in real-time which is a little
346000	bit frustrating when you're changing dpi
347530	settings because as you set up each one
349960	the Bellis of speed changes instantly
351610	making it hard to move to the next one
352990	but for everything else it works fine
354730	then it's very very efficient Logitech
356800	has updated their macro creation
358690	interface since the last time I used it
360250	on a mouse and it's super intuitive now
362410	basically click on the button pick what
364630	you want to bind to decide if you want
366070	pauses or not and then save your config
368170	profile either to your PC or to the
370270	onboard memory on the mouse itself and
371950	then you can switch between those things
373510	with the click of a button
375220	angle snapping is handled by a single
377290	on/off switch but hint guys just leave
380290	that off they also have a new a surface
383350	tuning feature now it's not the first
385840	time I've seen this kind of thing but
386950	it's definitely a first for Logitech
388390	anyway so what you do is you run the
390100	utility do figure Eight's on your
391780	mousepad for a few seconds and then I
393880	guess it's optimized I didn't personally
395650	notice any difference on this mousepad
397330	anyway but I think that's more of a
399480	testament to how well it tracks before
401130	tuning then a criticism of the tuning
403410	feature per se so this is where I would
406140	normally do a conclusion but I think
408060	I've said all I have to say about the
410010	g502 proteus core so I'm gonna shake
412140	things up here and close this video with
414150	a petty complaint here it goes it is
416730	unusual for an $80 Mouse to lack
419190	customizable lighting colors and the
421290	fact that I even noticed stood out to me
423240	because when I'm reviewing a mouse that
424740	I don't intend to actually put next to
426930	my system where I'll have to stare at it
429210	not matching my PC for months on end
431250	it's easy to say I don't really care
433560	about the LED colors when it's a mouse
436110	whose performance and ergonomics I like
437940	so much that I'm thinking of switching
439530	to it permanently all of a sudden those
441960	little details matter a lot more so
444570	there you have it the finish on the
445800	scroll wheel and the blue LED
447390	that's about all I could find wrong with
448680	it which is a pretty strong endorsement
451310	speaking of something wrong with it you
453360	may have noticed that my attire changed
455040	a couple of times that was no glitch and
457170	in fact it's related to our brand new
458940	sponsor 5 for clothing the way it works
461220	is this you go on the website and it
463110	prompts you to do a little survey about
464640	colors you like and styles you like that
466830	5 for claims you can do in under 60
469170	seconds turns out that their test
471060	subjects for this we're probably people
472620	exactly like me because it took me 54
474570	seconds assuming they're going yeah
476190	whatever just make this decision for me
477990	because I can't be arsed and clicking on
479730	things for me to finish it and that is
482430	the point of the 5 for club if you don't
485310	like shopping because sales people make
487200	you uncomfortable or you don't like
488850	shopping because you get lost in the
490110	mall or you don't like shopping because
492060	your wife wants to go with you then you
493740	have to watch her endlessly try on stuff
495180	you hate and sit there and tell her it
496320	looks good anyway
498750	the point is if you don't like shopping
500250	you sign up and for 60 bucks a month
502260	they send an equivalent of at least 120
504780	dollars worth of clothes to your door
506340	that are handpicked by your own personal
508440	stylist to make you look good they offer
510690	free shipping and easy size exchanges
513270	and the longer you're a member of the
514650	club the more you'll expand your
516299	wardrobe with new exclusive designs so
518099	you don't look like a hobo so head over
520349	to 5 for clothing calm use offer code
522479	Linus to save 15 bucks on your first
525000	month and another cool little trick is
526920	that once you're a member of the club
528330	anyone you refer saves another $15 say
532410	before you
533310	I was almost all the way through that
535050	saves you another $15 anyway the point
537120	is guys there's a bitly link in the
538830	video description go check it out I
540360	think by the time this video goes up
542040	there's gonna be like a landing page of
543630	me like modeling the clothing so for if
546000	nothing else there's the hilarity factor
548310	of that and you guys can definitely
549390	check that out because we all know I
551190	have no style and even seeing me in
553050	clothes that looks somewhat remotely
554550	good is just has blown the minds of two
557070	of the people here in the office already
558450	and the other two aren't even here so
560400	that's pretty much all I have to say
562110	about that anyway guys thanks for
563550	watching my team and I worked hard on
