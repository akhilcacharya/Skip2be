30	our coverage of CES 2018 is brought to
1920	you by fresh books the cloud-based
3210	accounting solution for small businesses
5339	and freelancers you can check them out
6750	at fresh books comm slash Lynas CES so
10530	we're coming to you from the msi suite
12750	where they've got is it a booth I don't
14460	know what this is it doesn't matter the
15870	point is there's some cool stuff in here
17670	first and foremost they've got a new
19740	version of their Trident gaming desktop
21689	that is a lot heavier than the old one
24600	I'm gonna drop it is he not going to
26130	drop it the point is the hardware has
28710	not changed a ton so you're still gonna
30869	get a core i7 processor but this time
33239	it's 8th gen for up to 6 cores and
35579	they've done up to a gtx 1080 graphics
39660	card in this tiny form factor now so all
42120	that weight that is a whole lot of
44010	heatsink cliff you ready big about also
47670	behind me they've got a new monitor so
50010	MSI's been doing monitors for a little
51719	while but they're really getting serious
53070	about it now this is the optics npg 27
56550	CQ 2 1440p 144 hertz freesync gaming
61170	display it's got a VA panel so you get
62969	those nice deep blacks on 3001 contrast
65159	ratio it's got 2 HDMI 2.0 ins and it
67860	DisplayPort 1.2 and most importantly RGB
72750	lighting so MSI has been working with
75000	partners like Corsair SteelSeries and
77220	coolermaster to enable you to
79110	synchronize the RGB lighting on the
80759	monitor with your peripherals or even
83340	with your computer but there's some
85590	special integration with SteelSeries so
88619	using steel series engines gamesense
90900	you can actually use the lights here for
93360	something that's not completely stupid
95369	because I don't think anyone was asking
97770	for RGB lighting around the outside of
99930	what they're trying to focus on no no
101909	but with game sense in supported games
104189	which includes games like counter-strike
105680	minecraft and dota with pub G coming it
108960	allows you to actually configure these
111780	not just in terms of brightness and
113670	color but to reflect things that are
115920	happening in game so you could have your
118110	right side change color according to
119850	your health your left side change
121380	according to your ammo oh and the middle
123420	one could maybe light up with brighter
125670	and brighter colors or it could flash
127049	every time you get a headshot pretty
128940	cool stuff another innovation in this
131430	monitor something that
132410	shocks me that we haven't seen before is
134540	the ability to change on screen menu
136520	items not just with the joystick at the
138530	back but also through a software
140630	application so everything from throwing
142670	a cheater crosshair in the middle of
144380	your monitor to adjusting the brightness
146090	to even changing your input can now be
149090	done through MSI's software so this
151610	one's gonna come at around 400 to 450
153980	bucks with an Nvidia g-sync version
156080	planned in the future though I would
157430	expect that one to cost a couple hundred
159290	dollars more because then the Nvidia
162160	licensing costs one more cool feature is
165530	that with all this lighting stuff you
167090	can actually synchronize across multiple
168770	systems if you're into that sort of
170090	thing or even that cool laptop over
171800	there that actually has the lighting on
173060	the back so this way if you've got a
174590	whole team of people playing you could
176270	like have them all flash red and then
177920	turn off like as they die in stuff
179420	that's cool so thanks again to
