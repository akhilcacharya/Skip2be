6470	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
8940	the neonics circus 900 this is a high
12660	performance get this guys this is a high
14730	performance microfiber desk pad yes they
18180	have made it so big that it is no longer
20640	a mousepad it's not for your mouse it is
23490	for your desk and then the most just has
26580	the good fortune to be placed on it so
29369	this is a desk pad moving right along
31289	improve tracking performance the
33239	microfiber surface counteracts data loss
35070	and improves sense of tracking
36270	performance all by that ok microfiber
37770	kind of does everything else right all
39780	right greater control more friction to
41579	improve control over movements now this
43290	is a personal preference thing I
44899	personally prefer a higher friction
47250	mouse pads not everyone does
49530	some people prefer more like a like a
51449	speed style mouse pad where there isn't
53340	any isn't any friction that is
56840	intentionally added to the whole
58649	experience and that's not to say that
60300	all friction is good like if you have
62219	like a mouse with no feet on it and it's
64860	just like metal across a wooden table
66720	like that would be bad friction but a
68640	little bit of friction I personally
70500	don't mind it kind of enhances the
72720	experience if you know what I mean
74220	so non-slip grip firm grip irrespective
77520	of the surface under the mousepad
78509	extra-wide tracking area hence the table
80970	pad moniker for sweeping movements
83280	without interruption
84210	a star has been born something something
86310	the location of the star or something
87750	about five times brighter let's go ahead
89460	and have it's actually got like
91560	something weight to it pet deep hey okay
98750	holy crap okay they weren't kidding this
104340	is a desk 10 so based on the I'd like I
111240	was expecting it to be big but I
112829	actually wasn't quite expecting this so
117119	based on the shape of it I guess like
119040	your keyboard actually goes on it and
120960	then that way your keyboard and your
123299	mouse are on the same level cuz I don't
125460	know how many times you guys have had to
126869	do this but when your mouse pad isn't
128220	more
128630	sighs like this actually that's still a
132650	pretty big mousepad a lot of the time
134240	you end up with like your keyboard going
135740	on your keyboard slightly crooked so
137600	maybe that's what they're going before
138860	here with the desk pad concept I mean
141170	just for the scale of this thing I mean
142760	here's like a leg that's what a leg
145160	looks like compared to this thing it's
147440	like Ella but it's an entire - leg
150680	length long with a Linus bum sort of
153470	width at the end here no no problem at
156800	all being being about that long without
159830	any difficulty can I have a mouse
161540	actually slick can you just sort of
163670	throw me one I don't remember what
164750	happened to that Corsair one that'll do
167210	thank you sir oh okay so let's go ahead
172160	and give you guys like see that's the
173870	scale of it go ahead and get like a nice
175790	top down sort of like doing this
178340	that is how large it is and that is the
180710	gaming experience you'll be having I
182600	mean they're not kidding like okay okay
183890	okay get this get this okay so if you
185420	actually have this setup so like your
187100	keyboard was over here and like your
189500	mouse handle is here they weren't
191420	kidding about long sweeping movements I
193910	mean you could be a low sensitivity
195380	gamer and still do a couple turns by the
198530	time you actually make it from edge to
199970	edge in this dustpan I think we've gone
202430	on about this for long enough so it's
204080	pretty thick it's not the thinnest clock
205640	mousepad I've ever encountered is
206870	certainly not the thickest either I
208310	think that award goes to that
210380	SteelSeries qck heavy or something like
212750	that nothing's ridiculously this thick
215840	there's your natural rubber grip on the
217490	back so it doesn't go anywhere once you
219380	put it down which is good because if it
221030	went somewhere it could destroy whatever
222740	it landed on and I think that pretty
225200	much covers it thank you for checking
