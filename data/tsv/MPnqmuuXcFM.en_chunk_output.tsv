6500	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
8849	the Logitech g600 MMO gaming mouse this
11700	mouse has been turning a lot of heads
13500	because it looks like it might be the
16500	perfect mouse because it just is awesome
19890	in fact this is okay total assign
23390	putting the product down this is the
25920	first Mouse that I've seen that has
28349	tempted me to ditch my Akari laser I
32360	know right like I love the Razer Naga
35010	but the shape doesn't quite do it for me
36780	like that but I love having all the
38010	buttons it's great for planning like
39480	torchlight or whatever else I don't
40739	actually planning on the most but it's
42180	still great for RPGs this the shape
45210	looks in pictures I haven't I haven't
47399	touched one yet looks like I might just
49980	go for it
50700	so MMO gaming those twenty of them oh
52559	two buttons I also love the way Logitech
54570	mice track like my g9x is awesome the
57329	only reason I use the iqari is because
58859	the shape really does it for me but it
60359	doesn't have enough buttons
61370	that's pretty stoked on this alright so
64290	200 280 $200 per inch okay let me point
67020	to mega pixels per second 30 G's maximum
69510	acceleration it's like how many G's can
72030	you have like a g20 MMO toon button it's
76140	a twelve thumb button the clickable
77369	scroll wheel that tilts dpi and profile
79200	switching all pre-configure for all
80490	tomorrow and will use right of the box
81630	no drivers required however you'll still
83640	benefit from installing drivers
84799	intuitive fun panel design it looks
87509	really good but I haven't tried it yet
89220	total personalization three onboard
91350	profiles store all your button
92670	assignments tracking information and
93840	lighting color settings use them as is
95700	or download the optional software to
97320	tweak them to perfection G shift and dpi
99270	shift activate G shift with the ring
101369	finger button doubling the functionality
103140	of any thumb button oh cool so you can
105899	shift neat okay or set your profile to
109290	use the button for dpi shift lowering
111149	the sensors dpi for precision moves like
113130	for sniping for example crafted for
115140	comfort it looks pretty good high
116909	precision laser sensor people swear by
119159	optical sensors still but I'm not really
122790	that sold look I love the iqari laser I
125399	can't think of any of you
126330	now we want an optical sensor versus
127830	that one intuitive light-up thumb tunnel
129780	made for the way you play so you can
130860	actually change the lighting to any
132270	color red green blue white or anything
134880	in between and let's go ahead and have a
138450	look you know the box could have been
139500	this big if they didn't have to say so
141210	much about how awesome this Mouse is
143330	because this is all we really needed
145670	okay no no software included download
148830	the latest from Logitech which is good
151860	just fine just fine
153780	oh wow this is the best sleeping I've
157350	seen on the court of a mouse ever like
160950	ever like look at this even right out of
163560	the box it looks like rope it doesn't
166680	have any of that like wired kinkiness to
170250	it not really it basically looks like
171600	the cord is wrapped in carbon fiber like
173940	can you see that can you see how awesome
175320	that is I yeah like I was biased already
179670	towards this mouse just because I'm
181320	really hoping it's as awesome as I think
183000	it is but now it's just sort of making
185370	it really hard for me to not just want
187530	one okay another thing that I love about
191400	Logitech I know their mice are durable
193200	I've been using my g9 for a few years
195209	now and the feets are still basically
197280	like the day I got it they don't wear
198930	through at all so again this the g600
202739	has very large very large slippy pads on
206130	the bottom all along the top of the
207989	mouse all on the bottom of the mouse all
209700	the shape is like sex in your hand but
214709	in a good way
215400	it's like perfect it's not a huge mouse
218310	um so if you have smaller hands it's
221820	probably going to work perfect for you
223080	as a palm grip you can see I can hold on
224850	to that just fine like I can shake my
226920	hand around I can hold on to it but
228480	without accidentally pressing any
230160	buttons except that left click I'm
231690	actually pressing that one but I'm not
233310	too worried about that none of the I
234870	don't have to hold on so tight that I'm
236459	going to accidentally press any of these
237840	buttons though that's for sure
239250	let's go ahead and peel this off okay
244750	got like kind of a sort of crisis
248100	Nanosuit looking pattern on the side
250420	here back got ug 600 you got all your
253870	buttons okay so let me just sort of
255239	visualize what these are like so
258510	naturally these six are going to be easy
261760	I can tell that much just feeling them
263550	so these six at the front here are going
265810	to be easy once you come over these two
269530	ridges it becomes very clear which set
272620	you're touching and let me just see I'm
274780	going to be able to move this while
276970	operating these or operating these it
279280	requires a bit of a shift so what I'd
281380	say is you would want to have sort of
283300	these six be your main ones that you use
286120	and these ones would be like your
287620	backups with the exception of ones like
289420	this which you can reach quite easily
291160	even without moving just by rolling your
292990	thumb back and maybe yeah the bottom
295030	one's a little bit tougher even this
296830	one's pretty easy to feel just because
298540	you can you can really this Ridge right
300910	here is really the landmark that you've
303220	got so these all curve in when you have
306280	to have a look at this from the side
307150	they all curve in towards the center
308740	which gives you a really good feel for
310240	the 6 and the 6 and then these are quite
312730	sharp as you roll over those so that
314320	gives you a really good idea of which
315880	one you have your thumb on at any given
317650	time it's quite smart the one problem I
320890	had with the Naga was that really for me
323440	to use them I was only able to feel my
326530	way around maybe four or five of the
329230	button rooms easily this one I think I
331450	could probably use at least seven to
334390	eight of them without any difficulty
336220	this one as well is going to be quite
337450	easy to get to because of the fact that
339220	it's got this this bump on it right here
341830	so I'm thinking at least eight nine this
345490	is pop man I'm liking this so you got a
348370	couple more G buttons here this is that
349960	one that can be programmed either as a
351640	shift or as a or as a dpi switcher
354460	another programmable button here these
357000	see I can reach that like this this one
359860	I don't find to be that useful though
361390	the g8 I don't think I'd be able to
363280	reach that in a game this has a tilt
365800	either way that'll obviously be usable
367870	middle-click will be usable and the
369370	shape of this is very nice your fingers
371320	fit in quite easily and the pinky can
374050	either sit on the grip here perfectly
376460	and grip so that you can keep it above
377870	the mousepad if you want or you can let
379910	your pinky drag which some people do
381410	like to do as well I'm actually going to
383660	get slick to give us the large handed
385580	person perspective on this so here just
387860	give me the camera and sort of just
391660	maybe give me the give me the nod or the
394280	not nod so that's what it looks like in
396860	much larger hands here here's slicks
398449	hand versus my hand certainly yeah see
401300	so we're talking a pretty big difference
403430	here that's not a trick of the camera
404870	folks anything MIT mostly claw grip yeah
408470	okay
409009	see for me I can palm it what if you
410810	tried upon it yeah so that's kind of
413990	jokes if you try to palm that your
415280	fingertips will be nowhere near the
416419	buttons see that so just a couple dates
420199	oh yeah it'll be a claw grip for larger
422030	handed people and it'll be a fingertip
423530	grip for people who have smaller hands
425990	or the ladies out there who want to play
428240	there you know my little pony anima or
431060	whatever it is the girls girl gamers
432710	play I'm just I'm just kidding I'm just
434900	kidding I know girl gamers play real
436789	games they just aren't watching this
437990	channel so I don't have to worry about
439130	what they think okay okay okay
442400	nice to be clear three percent of my
444050	viewers are female so for those three
446210	percent I'm sorry thank you for checking
448310	out this unboxing and first look at the
450229	oh you want me to plug it in right he
452210	kept gesturing I wasn't sure like I
453919	wasn't sure what he meant by he could
456110	have met like shank someone or you could
458180	admit like I don't know I wasn't sure
461060	where he was going with that let's go
462530	ahead and plug it in and have a look at
463639	the lighting effect so I'm expecting it
465500	to glow at some point all year looks
469219	pretty good
469900	look at that a sigh closer all the
471860	colors for you well it's like doing
473539	something fantastic actually those are
476419	some of the better so there's some of
478669	the better color transitions that I've
480169	seen as well very very granular so thank
485479	you for checking out this unboxing and
486740	first look online is tech tips don't
