0	I have received endless requests on box
3629	this product this is the say tech rat 7
6450	so the rat is available in four
8460	different flavors the seven is the
10230	highest end one although there is a nine
12330	it is the same Mouse as the rat seven
14849	except it is Wireless instead of Wired
17630	this is a fifty six hundred dpi Mouse
20699	it connects to your computer via USB -
23100	all of that is completely unacceptable
26039	the part that is interesting is the fact
28529	that this is adjustable in almost every
30840	dimension and angle so the rat 7 has
33360	little gears and dials all over it to
35730	make it mold perfectly to your hand no
38370	matter what kind of hands you have so
39899	you can see I have stumpy hands see I
42300	have these short fat fingers that make
44579	most mice fairly uncomfortable for me
47010	but my understanding is with the rat 7
49500	no matter what kind of fingers I have it
51570	will be comfortable so you can see the
53489	box is a very very high quality box you
55770	can open up the front of it and you can
57870	see a little window that has the rat 7
59940	in it we've got some more features here
61500	so they show some of the different dials
63449	that you can use to adjust dimensions of
65850	the rat 7 so you can move this you can
68970	move this aspect of it the thumb rest
70560	out and in you can move it forward and
72600	back that's pretty cool so you can move
74580	the bottom here down and up let me see
79409	how this one works not sure let me see
82439	what else we've got here holder
86189	here's a storage tin okay why don't we
88290	just open it up and see what happens
89990	hopefully I have my feet oh I don't have
92700	my keys on me this is gonna be bad
99080	cameraman has a key on him hopefully I
102390	can figure out how do you even open this
104130	box every once in a while I encounter a
106140	box that's a bit of a challenge to unbox
108060	ah there we go
109320	so you actually have to open up the
110820	window in order to unbox this particular
113430	Mouse so we'll just kind of grab onto
115740	that there you know it's kind of
119369	surprising to me that no one has already
121140	thought of calling a mouse a rat when
123390	it's like an extreme mouse but yeah it
126090	looks like Saitek is the first to come
128068	up with that marketing idea very clever
130830	very clever indeed
134720	I'm just killing time right now until I
137220	can get the most out of the box or rat I
139590	should say and let me just kind of
142019	figure out what's uh what's under here
144209	this is a very complicated box I have no
148260	idea how I'm gonna put this back
149850	together when I'm done here because I do
152640	not get it hold on a minute
154920	ah caught right there okay let's add up
158850	come on come on oh thank you okay so
163410	inside the box now that we finally have
165120	it open we have a cyborg gaming disc
168560	that presumably has some drivers and
171090	such on it then we have a little limited
173370	warranty thing yeah drivers probably or
176970	not doesn't really matter if there are
179430	drivers you should download the latest
180840	ones from the SE tech website okay next
184470	we have a little guidance okay so it
189269	shows you how to use the four
192870	user-definable DPI settings how to use
196709	the interchangeable pinkie and palm
198359	rests okay how to use precision aim mode
201359	that's kind of a cool button I wonder if
203430	it'll make my aiming more precise sure
205620	hope snow
206910	okay the head tilts to further optimize
208680	button position so that's oh one number
212940	one worldwide in kisi place I can't tell
215430	what this is some parts of it look like
216930	kind of a manual and other parts look
218430	kind of like a catalog so here you have
220770	custom length adjustment and it shows
223230	another indicator for precision a mode
225590	okay oh that's the rat five oh this is
228570	all the different rat series mice they
230250	all look the same right this is the rad7
232440	this is the one we have today this is
235170	the rat three so it doesn't have the
237300	precision aim mode it doesn't have all
238800	the adjustable stuff on it the rat five
241350	right here lacks d looks like the DPI
245130	channel because they buttons there okay
247020	forget it
250310	concert' the CD okay there's your Quick
252780	Start Guide
253790	there's your user definable dpi settings
256649	right there on the back here shows you
260548	how to set your precision aim button so
263070	you can set a percentage decrease of
264900	most sensitivity while precision aim
266460	button is held
267300	so you actually hold it down when you're
268800	sniping that's kind of clear and then
271080	here we have a huge box full of
273270	accessories and there's another cutout
275420	other stuff came in I guess it would go
278460	in there so let's find out what we have
280170	in terms of accessories we have pinky
283470	one ah
285650	come on out okay so that is pinky one so
290460	I guess it works kind of like that when
292230	it's nope nope let's work like that when
294060	it's attached to the mouse
295020	okay then we have pinky - so this goes
299370	on a completely different way it's kind
300810	of a little rubberized grip instead of a
302370	rest alright then we have a
308009	wait cartridge here's the wait cartridge
311960	cool and next we have palm rest too so
317759	this is a replacement palm rest for the
319529	one that comes installed on the mouse
322849	the palm rest one hand palm rest - sorry
325499	so one of them is kind of a rubberized
327559	semi textured surface and the other one
329939	is a very very grippy rubberized surface
332460	more like like a tire than anything else
335009	so it's actually got treads on it
337559	alright so go ahead and close back in
339960	there and now without further ado we
343169	will finally have a look at the rat
345629	seven mouse as soon as we undo these
350550	twist ties bear with me here
359100	I do like fancy retail packaging but it
362400	makes my job a little bit more difficult
364320	because I have to do all of this on
366180	camera in one take
370210	that cake and I can't get it out of the
372610	box yeah yeah it's a hard profession huh
378009	unboxing products for a living but
380220	somebody's got to do it somebody has got
384340	to do it
385330	there we are that is the rad7 so why
388990	don't I start with showing some of the
390490	features that we've talked about already
391720	so here come in and have a have a closer
393699	look cameraman so there's your forward
395740	and back buttons there's your precision
397690	aim button so that's very comfortably
399580	positioned to easily press it and then
402069	you can even press one of these other
403389	buttons at the same time depending on
404949	what kind of key bindings you're using
406330	here is a mode button right there so
409210	that's within easy reach of your index
411160	finger here is your DPI toggle button
414960	there's your left-click there's your
417070	right click over on the other side we
419620	have the interchangeable pinkie spot so
422080	we can use any of the other two pinky
424270	ones to attach there under here we have
427659	weights so let me see how to I'm
431319	guessing if I undo this it will release
433690	the weight cartridge somehow so we're
435009	not actually going to do that for the
436090	time being because as much as I want all
438460	the weights all over this park bench
440169	that would that would make my life more
442630	difficult so there you have it so it
445030	adjusts this way it adjusts this way
447460	this way many many many different ways
450719	if I could figure out where some of the
452949	buttons are to adjust anything and that
454539	would be great but maybe we'll do a
456039	follow-up video on this one and show all
458229	of those other aspects of it it has a
460150	very very high quality braided cord on
462370	it so you can see that you cannot see
464710	through the braiding at all and it's got
466479	a gold plated USB 2.0 connector and
469389	thank you for checking out the unboxing
471370	of the say tech rat 7 completely
475930	adjustable Gaming Mouse
479460	so after consulting the manual we
481810	figured out how to make most of the
483129	adjustments here so okay first of all
485379	you get the the key out of the back see
488199	it's stored right in the back of the
489370	mouse like that isn't that clever so you
491199	just pull that out by unscrewing it and
492960	then there's a an allen key spot right
496330	here so you use that one to adjust the
498550	thumb piece front and back so you see
500289	I'm moving it backwards right now I hope
502479	you can see that I'm moving it forward
504310	right now pretty cool and then there's
507370	another key spot right in here so you
509770	just loosen that one a little bit that
511569	allows you to adjust it this way and
513750	then once you've got it such that it is
516309	in exactly the right comfortable
518440	position for you you just put the hex
520360	key back in there screw it in tight and
523649	it won't move anymore there it is nice
528190	and solid and then what was the last one
530769	yeah and the last one how to adjust the
532690	palm pieces you just push in this little
534519	button right here slide it back and then
537040	it locks wherever you want to put it so
538959	if you have a larger hand and you can
540339	adjust it so the pump sits much further
541810	back I don't so I would probably use it
544149	pretty much in its stock configuration
545880	so that is pretty darn cool one thing I
548800	didn't mention in the last video was it
550690	actually has an aluminum base so this
552370	thing is built like a tank it's quite
554470	heavy so I would probably recommend you
556449	remove some of the weights that come on
557800	buy stock so you just undo this you can
559839	pull the weights off and put them in
560980	your little weight storage container
562120	thanks for checking out this addendum to
564459	the previous unboxing
