30	thank you a tunnel better for sponsoring
1560	this video at CES 2018 tunnel bear makes
3929	very easy to use privacy apps for the
6089	Internet so that you can enjoy a more
7890	open Internet to try it out for free go
9960	to tella bear comm slash LTT we're here
12389	at Thermaltake checking out their view
13980	37 case first thing your to notice other
16830	than that it just looks amazing in its
18510	current configuration at CES is these
20760	huge 200 millimeter fans behind the
23490	acrylic in the front of the case this
25680	won't come with the case the standard or
27689	the upgraded RGB version but you'll be
30119	able to add them yourself if you want to
32040	have a different configuration than
33480	these 200 millimeter fans up in the
35399	front you can have up to three 120
37500	millimeter fans or two 140 millimeter
40050	fans moving inside the case from there
42090	you can see this awesome radiator that's
43710	mounted on the right hand side you could
45570	set up this current configuration with
47430	three 120 millimeter fans or go down to
49950	two or one and then in the back there's
52320	a 140 millimeter fan placed there
54329	currently that should come with both
56219	versions of the case that you could buy
57719	but it would be a different fan than the
59489	one that's currently in here but you
60989	could tone that down to 120 if you
63239	wanted in terms of where all these crazy
65129	fans are gonna actually breathe from
66960	because you see this huge acrylic panel
68939	on the front and this nice curved
70680	acrylic panel on the side the front ones
73020	will breathe in through the side there's
74400	grills along there they're fairly large
76439	that won't give them the most amount of
78090	airflow but it is a huge amount of fans
80610	that you can mount there so it should
81659	breathe pretty okay and this radiator
84000	placement just on the inside of the case
85500	should be able to breathe super easily
87210	as it has its own cutout in the back so
90030	the huge fans in the front are able to
91860	feed both the back fan and the radiator
94470	fans that are just mounted on the inside
95970	and just in front of the power supply if
98400	you do go with the vertical GPU mount
100320	you can see here in this current
101880	configuration that they have the pump
103500	and the reservoir mounted very nicely
105240	right behind there so you can have a
106770	whole bunch of really tight nice water
109110	cooling setups like they have with their
110579	hardline in terms of front IO they have
112680	an RGB button for changing color modes
114899	they have two USB 3 ports two USB to
117540	ports headphone and microphone jacks a
119640	power button and an activity LED so if
122640	you think that setup looked great and
124229	you want to emulate something like that
125670	or do something in another case whatever
127530	brand it may be you could pick up one of
129780	their water
130690	Kitt's if you're worried about doing
132490	water cooling if maybe it's your first
133810	time and you want everything handled for
135700	you you can pick up anything in their
137500	range right here they have an m240 which
139810	is a 240 millimeter rad and it's more a
142390	little bit simple compared to the other
144130	ones there's no crazy RGB or anything
146380	going on there you can move up to an M
148540	360 which has more RGB going on it's a
151330	360 radiator it's a little bit more
153660	full-featured and then if you want to go
155650	absolutely crazy with a radiator that
157720	has RGB on it with a water block that
160150	has RGB on it with a reservoir that has
162130	RGB on it just full balls-to-the-wall
163690	and even more fittings all of these come
166390	with right angle fittings too which is
168070	cool you're gonna be set up for hardline
169870	water cooling and pretty much whatever
171370	situation you're gonna have it will all
172990	be taken care of for you and a hard line
175060	is a little bit of a scary thing for
176800	some people to get into so this setup
179170	will help you get started in that scary
181720	arena of water cooling at all and the
183580	advanced difficulty of hardline and more
185980	in that vein all of these kits come with
187450	clear liquid but if you want to change
189040	the color of the liquid you could pick
190870	up one of thermal takes of different
192400	various colored dyes or use really any
194350	dye for that matter speaking of making
196750	things easier you can use tunnel Bayer
198489	to create a VPN for you and it's all
200350	simple you don't have to do any router
201640	settings you know if you do a firewall
203110	settings you just turn on the app the
204580	Bayer tunnels you to whatever server
206050	location you want and it's all done it's
208120	all handled your privacy is secure
209830	they'll help protect you against people
211360	that are trying to profit off of your
213040	data because it will protect from that
214989	and did I mention it's free go to tell
