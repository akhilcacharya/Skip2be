6740	welcome to my unboxing of the simraceway
9710	s1 now you might not recognize the brand
12990	simraceway when it comes to gaming
15630	peripherals however you'll probably
17730	recognize this one so co-developed with
20340	SteelSeries this is a racing wheel that
23789	uses motion control rather than actually
27869	being like fixed to an object like a
30900	table or like a huge chair setup so it
34230	uses motion control and the hugest
38129	variety of buttons that I think I've
40079	ever seen on a controller to give you a
42329	sim type feel and sim type flexibility
45780	and customization without being bolted
48149	down literally to a fixed furniture
52050	object and without taking up a ton of
53789	space in your home so motion controlled
56789	customizable driving experience steering
58800	shift and pedal controls all in your
60899	hands let's go ahead and see what else
63030	they have to say for themselves
64229	quick rotary dials for driving aids
66770	realistic racing wheel shifters cool
69030	okay responsive rpm / shift indicator
71549	lights customizable steering sensitivity
73770	rubberized racing wheel comfort grips
75869	and fully programmable 15 buttons and
77970	d-pad right full range throttle and
80850	brake controls and a high accuracy
82290	handheld motion controlled stewing
83759	package co-developed with steel series
85350	help it includes simraceway of the game
87570	however saying it includes simraceway
89250	the game is kind of like saying that it
90900	includes oxygen because simraceway is
92850	actually free to play which is pretty
94860	cool online world focused on live
97590	multiplayer racing for you to play no
99270	subscription fee simulation great
101159	driving physics laser scan tracks and
102780	proprietary skill matching technology
104189	for closer racing across all skill
105780	levels that can be a huge problem with
107100	racing games if you have that like super
109229	legit player that just sort of destroys
112350	everyone else it's not really fun to
114869	race when you're actually alone on the
117659	track and you have no chance of catching
119640	up to anyone or anyone catching up to
121590	you that's just boring um oh it also
124590	comes with ten dollars of in game
125820	currency so yes it's free to play but
127680	micro micro transaction driven so you
130679	can buy like cars
132100	stuff cool okay my understanding is
134770	people who like racing games like you
136930	know driving the cool car in the racing
138550	game and you know that sort of things so
140800	I'm not much of a racing game guy myself
143230	so so don't get me wrong although I
145210	shouldn't really call it I shouldn't
146650	really call it a game outright because
148440	simraceway is not it's more of a sim
151570	than a game so games tend to have more
154180	of an Arkady style of physics where it's
156670	not realistic but it might be easier or
159370	more fun for for novices whereas sims
162130	tend to be more realistic so it's easier
164500	to do things like spin out and crash but
167350	if you actually wanted to to practice I
170680	mean some sins even are used by
172030	professional drivers to practice a new a
173680	new track that they haven't that they
175810	haven't done before so if you want a
177880	more realistic driving experience then
179800	you definitely want to go with something
181180	that uses realistic physics and if I
183580	could get this package open I would be
185650	some kind of a hero man because this is
188700	unbelievable oh it should be noted
193090	though that just because it's compatible
194890	and comes with simraceway and comes with
197200	$10 of in-game money it is actually
200110	compatible with any other pc racing game
202630	as well so they list a bunch of them on
204700	the website that it is specifically
206260	compatible with but then at the end of
207730	it is also all PC racing games so that
211450	is totally never going back in that
213970	packaging that much is very clear what
216550	do we got here long periods of
218230	repetitive motion using an improperly
219790	set up workspace on there's your s RW
222070	currency cool okay and also seems to
225130	come with a small instruction guide
226780	that's very eco-friendly you know small
228970	instruction guide so you can tell they
230230	didn't cheap out on the instruction
231640	guide because it's printed in color but
234390	that they didn't want to you know overdo
237070	the paper we have dispensed with discs
240970	to save the planet that's right don't
243610	bother throwing away the CD it doesn't
245410	come with one you can just download the
246850	latest off of haha simraceway TOCOM
249160	slash download underscore client there
250840	you go getting started guide and blah
253150	blah blah ah yes that's what we want so
255520	this shows what all of the buttons are
257410	for by default and what they actually do
259450	this talks a little bit about the
261600	steering allows you to fine-tune some
263800	race-based driving aids in order to
265400	your preferences so to change the value
268190	of an asset assist select using the
269960	assist dial and then turn the assist
271669	values dial to desired setting low
273380	medium high or off to turn all the SS
275660	off select all on the assist style and
278600	turn the assess value style to off very
281389	very cool please note that once you've
283610	been turned off that can only be turned
284720	back on individually so assists driving
288080	assists you got all kinds of different
289789	things that's some pieces of the red
293300	packaging okay so spin stab shift clutch
296539	abs break traction steer pit in vault
299150	lock and also lock would probably be
301580	what you'd want to have it on after
302690	you've set everything so basically if
303860	you go okay I want clutch assists to be
306860	high so you said it'll like that very
310520	cool so I'm going to turn that off by
312350	default and okay so here's our shifter
316729	here's our presumably throttle and brake
319340	but give me a sec guys alright so I was
322190	right which is a miracle because like I
324169	said not really into racing game so this
325789	is shift up shift down this is your
327979	brake this is your throttle so these are
330919	all actually easy to reach even for
332960	someone like me with relatively small
334490	hands however once you're on these I
336860	don't know that you'd you know I don't I
339680	don't know that you'd necessarily be
342020	able to reach everything so you can see
344030	my thumb's can just barely make it to
347389	the paddle and then just barely make it
350360	to some of these however most of this
352070	stuff you shouldn't really have to use
354050	in games so let's have a look at what
355880	all the buttons are so the conveniently
357590	located buttons that I will
359300	realistically be able to press no I
361130	can't reach that one can't reach that
362930	one then I'll realistically be able to
364729	press with my fingers on the paddles
367340	shifting and braking and our look right
370099	and look left so that's yeah okay that's
372740	pretty that's pretty basic umm the stuff
376789	that i realistically wouldn't be able to
378530	reach but most people probably could are
380389	things like speed limiter and request
382159	pit i should be noted that things like
383840	speed limiter so this is for when you're
385340	in the pits are not necessarily
386599	available on our cars but because this
389030	is a racing accessory it does have the
392180	it does accommodate some special options
394520	that aren't available in all cars like
396260	launch control which gets you off the
398180	line if the cars up
399110	and boost which it boosts your speed if
403729	the car supports it so things like that
405530	so if you have larger hands than me
407990	remember guys my hands are super small
409400	then you should realistically be able to
411229	reach this probably this you should be
414199	able to reach boost as well as lights I
416270	just can't quite make it there so what
418340	else do we have so we got look-back rear
420949	brake balance front brake balance orange
423199	control which we covered HUD which i
425569	think is fairly self-explanatory or
427219	shows you the HUD or doesn't show you
428210	the HUD horn this one now this button
430370	actually has very cool functionality
432020	what it does is it makes it so that the
434120	car will actually lift off the ground
437120	and then it does like a complete
439250	rotation and then it will flip the
441590	wheels from the top of the car down to
442969	the bike from the bottom of the car down
444650	to the top of the car like transformer
446210	style and it will go along the road like
448699	gosh they just honk the horn
450080	so that honks the horn this is for
452240	navigating menus so you got like enter
454490	select your d-pad as well as your back
457340	button so you can actually I mean that's
458930	one of the biggest frustrations with
460279	with most racing wheels well the only
462919	real racing wheel that I've really used
464419	in the past g25 was that you actually
466729	still have to have a keyboard handy for
468289	a lot of games because you can't
469400	navigate anything by bearing in mind I
472669	didn't have the shifter plugged in so I
475219	think that has navigation buttons on it
476779	but there's a lot of accessories to plug
478250	in whereas this is just one piece that
479900	you can like store in your coffee table
482000	and not you know worry about it being in
485659	the way all the time right okay camera
489349	view changes all of that stuff
491719	aha so steering sensitivity you can
493520	change it anywhere from 180 degrees to
495469	360 degrees and then this we have
498710	already covered so let's see what else
500240	SteelSeries has to say for themselves
501949	here like I said guys I am NOT a racing
503900	aficionado so this is something I do
506659	need a little bow actually nope wait
508279	come back this is cool so the rubberized
510500	grips here are awesome these are these
512809	are like the stickiest rubber grips ever
514789	without feeling like it's sticky you
517789	know how sometimes you're just like oh
519469	it feels like you know silly putty it's
522049	not like that they feel very very nice
524300	there would be very difficult to
526100	accidentally drop this controller the
527870	rest of the unit has like a soft touch
529579	feel which is also very nice it has a
531560	braided cord we said
533000	look at how long the cord is actually
534530	that could be relevant so you're not
536420	going to be plugging this in from you
538310	know a super long way away it looks like
540050	about a Linus arm span and a half which
542600	for those of you who work with real
544430	measurements is probably about ten feet
547210	okay or three meters for those of you
550040	who used like real real measurements
551840	like not Imperial measurements
553130	um so Ready Set raise okay full range
556610	you can okay continue you can okay I
559370	would definitely recommend going to
560810	steel series calm and having a look at
562730	what they ought to say about it because
564170	the unit itself feels very solid without
566030	being too heavy and this gives you some
568490	idea of all of the customizability that
570620	is available here's a quick list of a
572690	bunch of games that supported during two
574730	gt-r live live for speed or heard that
577880	need for speed I've definitely heard of
579380	that one it's very mainstream um used by
582140	the pros interesting test and improved
584150	by professional racing drivers including
586210	Dario Franchitti
589900	relatively good Wow
592250	that's kind of cool I mean it's one
595040	thing when there's like a mouse that's
596480	like approved by pro gamers but when
598520	there you have like a wheel that's
599660	approved by pro drivers who like
601160	actually have to like risk their lives
603230	to do what they're doing and they say
605060	it's okay then that's a sort of
607160	meaningful actually for a neutral set up
609980	okay you can compromise between this and
611930	this so I think the point of all of this
615620	is the convenience factor so not having
619640	the bulky setup the customizability
622100	factor yeah it's kinda neat I mean it's
627410	a lot better than holding like a Wii
628730	mote so the PC is still light years
632570	ahead of consoles in terms of that the
634520	one drawback from my mind is lack of
637070	force feedback so personally I like I
639860	have a hard time with racing games
641120	already if I don't have hot force
642860	feedback I have a much harder time with
644630	racing games however if you just want
647420	yeah if you just want the convenience
648530	factor if you don't care about the force
650089	feedback and you want something that you
651950	can just kind of pack up and take with
653839	you somewhere very conveniently then
655880	this might be the way to go so thank you
657350	for checking out my unboxing and first
658490	look at the s-1 from steel series the
