960	[Music]
6589	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9570	the me onyx and sis the re 20 this is a
12120	high-performance aluminum mousepad if
14160	you guys have ever seen my desk at work
15809	I'm actually still using a steel series
18119	SX which is a discontinued model I love
21990	aluminum mouse pads and around the time
25050	they discontinued it I asked well can I
26970	like get an a couple more just in case
28920	you know this one eventually wears out
30990	which it has now so I'm very excited to
33780	check out this one so here here we go a
36300	star has been born okay never mind that
38100	model overview forged one millimeter
40530	aluminum alloy four strong but
41969	lightweight construction the surface and
43200	been treated with a very low data loss
44610	treatment which gives a matte black
45989	below I've never seen a matte black glow
49079	before but we're gonna have to take that
51239	off and sort of experience from that
53280	black glow for ourselves okay with a one
55500	millimeter natural rubber on your side
56879	it has a non-slip grip while maintaining
58260	a very low overall profile at two
59879	millimeters that is very low-profile
61770	compared to the one that I have now it's
64260	designed with our surface quality
65519	analyzer tool and its superior tracking
67200	minimal data loss it is a 10 out of 10
68960	very good suitable for optical and laser
72180	myself I probably wouldn't use it with a
73680	ball mouse ultra-low data loss okay they
76290	said that a lot of times effortless
77549	glide super low friction allows you to
79320	glide fast so this is not for people who
81360	prefer a little bit more friction on
83790	their mousepad but more for people who
86100	prefer a faster mousepad so it probably
87990	is a little bit smoother than the sx the
89790	XS X had some had some traction to it
93320	non-slip grip low profile okay so this
95700	is a little very repetitive so let's go
97409	ahead and put this put this away and
99540	let's have a look at the mousepad itself
101880	so I don't think we've actually gotten
103140	yeah no there's two plastic layers on
104880	this because see this this looked
106680	horrible I was gonna say wow this
107880	mousepad looks awful it's terrible look
110399	at the finish on this thing it's awful
112229	and on the bottom there's your rubber he
114479	makes it now go anywhere
116329	now let's experience the actual mousepad
119399	surface there we go
123580	I don't know that it glows but it feels
127870	pretty nice actually it's got a good
130440	yeah yep I'm a mouse whoo it's not loud
136750	like most aluminum mouse pads if you
138640	guys have ever used an aluminum or a
140110	glass mouse pad in the past like here
142360	get right close so they can hear like it
145870	doesn't have any noise to it it glides
147520	really really nicely I kind of like this
150420	they compare that to the table yeah it
157630	really has like some glide enos to it I
159460	was one there's one one blemish there
162130	that's not too bad overall
163300	well actually looks very good I mean
167770	it's a mouse pad so I don't know what
169270	else you guys want me to say if you're
170560	using a me onyx mouse are really
171820	basically any Mouse I do like aluminum
174130	mouse pads it's not for everyone however
176050	one of the major complaints I've had
177700	about aluminum mouse pads the loudness
179380	it's like kind of an abrasive noisy kind
181390	of thing going on seems to have been
183340	completely resolved with the NSS 320
185320	don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
187060	tips from our unboxings reviews and
188410	other computer videos and I hope you
189519	enjoyed this one
