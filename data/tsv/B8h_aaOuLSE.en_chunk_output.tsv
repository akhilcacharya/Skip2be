79	so today I'm going to be having a look
2129	at the razor like cosa mirror special
5400	edition so this is a backlit gaming
7649	keyboard and the biggest difference as
9840	far as I can tell between the lycosa and
12240	the light coset Mir special edition is
14099	that it has a high-gloss mirror finish
17640	on the hyper response keys
20039	okay backlight illumination macro
22230	programmable gaming keys that's very
24060	cool let's have a look at the back and
26160	we'll see what they are listing in terms
28199	of specs so it is a plastic key top okay
30810	it is a three simultaneous key presses
34350	is the the the anti-ghosting features
36809	that it has oh no this is stupid I'm
38670	reading the verses a standard laptop one
40890	okay now this is a high-gloss mirror
42540	finish key top selected anti-ghosting
45149	gaming cluster okay so the anti-ghosting
47700	gaming cluster is around all of the
50190	gaming Keys that you would typically use
52199	and you can see one of the backlight
54210	features that they have around that
56190	gaming cluster is that you can backlight
58350	only the gaming Keys like the WASD okay
61920	other cool stuff they have a touch panel
63539	media keys which is kind of like what
66210	they have on the Mako speakers it's all
68580	like touch sensitive it's very cool and
70380	then they have an integrated USB
72200	extension extension port your phone out
75119	microphone Ian's jacks that's always
76470	kind of nice to see as well alright what
78659	else do we have here - damn 1,000 Hertz
81299	ultra poling ok that's enough of the box
82860	let's open this thing up and have a look
84600	because ultimately that's what matters
86580	more than anything else about a keyboard
88470	is how good it feels when you're trying
90810	to type and/or game on it so let's get
93960	this baby open
95280	I love razors packaging just the black
97829	look with the green accents on it and
100439	the shiny box
101880	very nice anyway yeah see this this is
104159	what I'm talking about this is awesome
105659	packaging awesome presentation okay you
107549	got your Razer logo so let's see what we
109950	have included here first of all the
111570	Razer guy is saying this thing is really
113310	good and then we have the accessory
115770	package here so for gamers by gamers
118290	let's get this open and find out what we
120780	have inside all right if I could pull
124350	this stuff out then that would work a
125670	lot better so we have a certificate of
128128	authenticity in both
129220	English and French we have the quick
131470	start guide which shows you how to plug
133090	a keyboard into a computer okay that's
134920	awesome
135340	then we have the master guide which is a
137800	much longer version of how to plug a
139690	keyboard into a computer probably shows
141310	you how to configure the software all
143290	the little things like that tells you
144670	all the little cool stuff about this
146080	keyboard in English and French very nice
148150	we have a little cloth for cleaning your
150550	keyboard that's really good because for
152470	I guarantee this thing's a fingerprint
154300	magnet a couple of razor stickers and a
156880	razor product catalog so it's got a
158620	bunch of the other stuff that razer
159850	sells very cool all right let's get this
162730	mid plate out here and let's have a look
164740	at the keyboard of mom this is like a
166180	huge box how am I supposed to get at
167770	this okay so in terms of plugs here we
171670	go we have one USB interface for the
174910	keyboard itself one for the hub okay or
177730	the extension and then we have a
179290	headphone and microphone jack that go
181810	around to the back of your computer and
183190	this is a really neat feature that I
185110	really like to see I mean what makes a
186550	keyboard a gaming keyboard unless it has
188950	something that optimizes it for our
190630	gaming experience so it means that you
192670	can take your your headset and you can
194560	plug it around into your keyboard so
196060	that's not hanging down across your
197709	keyboard into the back of the computer
198880	very very handy so here's the back of
201760	the keyboard let's look at that first
203350	there is nothing exceptional about it
205810	whatsoever you've got a couple of these
207580	tilty pins awesome okay let's go around
210100	to the front so that is the lycosa
212500	mirror now I have to confess I was
215650	expecting more of a mirror and less of a
218560	dark mirror but this is really nice
220540	looking too so it's got a highly highly
222930	glossy black finish over all of the keys
226540	you can see through down to where the
228549	backlight comes from okay so that's a
231280	clear that's a clear spot on every
233019	single key and in terms of typing it's
235299	not very loud actually I'm going to stop
238230	talking for a second so that you can get
240400	some idea how loud the keys are in terms
242620	of comfort it's hard to gauge very
244180	quickly but they have a very sensible
245680	layout to this keyboard they haven't
247000	done anything stupid that would
248500	interfere with gaming like shortening
249790	your left shift key or that went
252400	interfere with typing like shortening
253870	the backspace key over here so they've
256660	got a proper proper layout and I think
259839	I'm pretty much done talking about the
261279	keyboard why don't we do just
262930	more close-up shots I'll get the
264520	cameraman to kind of have a look down
266290	the keyboard here so you can see just
267970	how shiny this thing is I mean check out
269680	check out my hand in the reflection that
271509	is one shiny keyboard surface thank you
274810	for checking out my unboxing of the
276310	razor like cosa mirror gaming keyboard
