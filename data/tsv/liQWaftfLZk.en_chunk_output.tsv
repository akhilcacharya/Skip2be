6049	the BitFenix prodigy M is compact and
9300	ready for anything
10500	click now to learn more welcome to kind
12900	of a cheating unboxing this is the
14549	corsair Raptor k 30 I do have a box and
17100	there is a keyboard inside but I have
18420	definitely already taken it out of the
21060	box so inside you will find the keyboard
23430	of course the presentation of yours will
25199	be a little bit better because your box
26369	won't be ripped and your keyboard will
27900	be like wrapped in plastic or something
29519	you also find did you do to do a
32308	warranty guide as well as a QuickStart
34920	guide but quite frankly if you need a
36180	Quick Start Guide for a keyboard than
37710	here let me help you this is a USB port
39780	no this isn't a port this is a plug
41670	maybe I should check the Quick Start
43050	Guide no I'm just kidding ah the USB
45090	plug goes into the computer and then
46770	don't worry about it too much beyond
48180	that now what is the K 30 do differently
51270	than the other Corsair keyboard well
52620	number one is that it is more value
54510	conscious which is to say it's cheaper
56550	it's less expensive it has membrane key
59460	cat chats I did it again we lost a
63120	previous shock as I said key caps it has
65159	membrane key switches versus mechanical
67320	key switches it sure what you'll find on
68729	Corsairs higher-end keyboards like the
70290	k7 year the K 95 it also has plastic
73500	construction so even though you've still
75240	got that same two-tone sort of sleek
77700	looking finish with the black with the
80040	back black base plate and the silver top
82049	it is all made of plastic on this
83850	particular model and you've only got a
86070	single color backlight although at this
88080	price it is actually kind of nice to see
90000	a backlight at all so it has a red
91829	backlight with six levels of
93060	illumination and it doesn't have quite
95280	as many banks of macro keys as some of
97049	the higher-end keyboards although I
98549	personally find this to be enough
100170	because particularly if you're gaming on
102180	WASD can you really reach over to a
103979	second or a third bank of macro keys I
106500	kind of doubt it and you have three
108299	different layers of functionality for
110070	them with the M keys up at the top
112470	you've got a Windows lock key brightness
114450	adjust dedicated key so no function
116460	nonsense for that you've also got
118590	dedicated media keys although I really
120719	wish that they'd found a way to
122280	implement their volume scrollbar instead
125610	of just volume buttons like they have on
127229	their higher-end keyboards that's kind
128940	of unfortunate it is not a ten keyless
131220	model so you have the full keyboard
132390	layout and if there was
133440	one thing that I was going to say is a
135120	little bit funny about this one
137280	you've got color-coded WASD which is
139290	normal but see this the spacebar
141720	actually has a bit of an angle to it so
144270	it is not necessarily as optimized for
147300	typing where you'd expect the spacebar
148860	to be more flat but it is definitely
151380	more comfortable if you have a more
153000	relaxed WASD position on the keyboard
155760	this isn't something that Corsair
157020	markets but you can actually see the
158760	entire bottom row has that curvature to
161250	it which isn't something that you would
162540	normally find on a keyboard it does
164910	feature anti-ghosting technology so
166800	while it's not you know in key rollover
168750	or anything like that you're not going
170640	to be running into issues normal into
172650	normal use where you're pressing buttons
174960	and you're having random extra
176160	keystrokes generated and ok we can flip
179610	around to the bottom where you have
180810	rubber feet on the bottom
182330	unfortunately no rubber feet are built
184440	into the little stand up pieces however
186720	these two at the bottom are quite large
188640	and robust so you shouldn't have too
190050	much difficulty with that and finally of
192870	course there's the onboard memory so
195210	that means that once you've set up these
196890	advanced macro keys and whatever else
198600	that you set up on it you don't have to
200400	worry about installing the driver
201510	software on any PC that you would happen
203489	to use it on or if you reformat or
205020	whatever else because it will be stored
206730	on the memory built into the keyboard so
