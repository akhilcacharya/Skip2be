0	this portion of our CES coverage is
1650	brought to you by LastPass check out the
3419	link in the video description to start
5040	securing your passwords today we are
8580	here at Delaware they're showing off the
10740	new XPS 13 and naming scheme aside it
16949	looks pretty darn impressive the first
18840	thing we noticed about it is that it is
20609	way smaller they actually removed 24% of
25470	the overall volume and they did all of
27930	that while making some pretty impressive
30269	upgrades so the bezels are even thinner
33510	it weighs even less at only about 1.2
36780	kilograms and it packs eighty percent
39719	ball Paw Paw bonds so it's got an eighth
42719	gen up to Core i7 processor and due to
47010	Dells unique cooling approach they are
49410	actually claiming that they're going to
50760	be able to turbo this bad boy up higher
53370	and for a longer and they're able to do
56489	this thanks to the dual heat pipe dual
59280	fan cooling solution that's capable of
61469	dissipating up to twenty-seven watts
63390	that they've packed in here
65129	they've added their insulation to the
66900	bottom and the top to keep too much of
68549	that heat from being passed to the user
69960	and there are a bunch of other creature
71460	comforts as well ships with up to a 4k
73979	HDR touchscreen display with full
77189	coverage of Adobe RGB the IO is a pretty
79860	solid mix with a three-and-a-half
81299	millimeter Jack USB 3 a micro SD and
84290	dual Thunderbolt included Windows hello
88229	with an IR emitter for face detection is
90390	included and even better than just being
93090	included it's no longer at the bottom
94860	left so they're just tied for the worst
97409	placement of their webcam instead of
99509	being actually the absolute worst and
101520	they are claiming up to 19 hours of
104250	battery life on this puppy
105509	what's more the white version they say
108180	is smudge resistant they wouldn't let us
110460	actually put permanent marker on it but
112110	they say that a lot of things should be
113490	able to just wipe right off like the
116250	rest of Dell's 2018 lineup it includes
118380	Dells Mobile Connect software which
120689	allows you whether it's Android or iOS
122729	to take calls answer
124900	messages and on Android even use apps
127780	just on an application on your desktop
130030	wirelessly and they are expecting it to
132130	be available sometime in March so thanks
136600	to LastPass you're sponsoring this video
137980	LastPass is a key part of the way that
140500	we manage our credentials and
142530	information for events like CES the last
146290	thing you want to be doing in the middle
148180	of the night when you're trying to get
149320	an upload up is calling someone else who
152320	may actually be sleeping to try to get a
155320	password or trying to do a password
157750	reset when then maybe you're on a new
160000	device because sometimes we use
161320	unfamiliar laptops that are you know
163150	more editing capable when we're doing
164650	trips like this you're not logged into
166480	anything
167260	LastPass takes care of all of that it
169450	allows you to manage your password
170920	safely and securely with a one strong
173800	password and optional two-factor
176140	authentication so you never have to
177880	reuse a password again and it even
180670	allows you to easily share with other
182770	people so if that sounds good to you
184540	whether you're looking at the premium
185590	option for personally is the team's
187600	option for small business or the
189459	enterprise option for large business
