6680	welcome to my unboxing of the magic
9719	touch ninja ten kilos keyboard from
12360	Philco
13349	so Philco is well no mystery to keyboard
18930	aficionados and this one is absolutely
22310	beautiful
23730	I actually didn't check the outside of
26039	the box before we open this and I didn't
28380	realize that this was hi actually you
33450	know what slick and I were discussing
35219	this before we before we started doing
37980	the keyboard unboxings for all of the
39719	end all of the keyboards that are
41070	alright and I was saying that I didn't
43260	think I was going to be a fan of the
46230	side labelled cheese but I am I really
51690	like it so it looks just beautiful and
54360	elegant and plain from the top down and
56399	then from a slight angle you can see all
59039	the keys just like that I really like
61260	this okay so Philco right no no stranger
64739	to connoisseurs of quality keyboards um
69090	extremely well built some of the best
71460	out there so there is no flex to the
74340	deck nothing whatsoever the weight that
76710	they had even a 10 kilos model like that
78720	which means there's no number pad you
80549	could probably still stun you know um
83189	invader with it no problem with that
84810	they also have a ton of different
87930	customization options so you can
89579	customize so many different things you
91920	can customize the color of your deck you
95850	can customize the types of keys that you
99240	have on it so you can either have
100650	writing on the top writing on the sides
102720	you can have a full you can alright you
105810	can customize the layout so you can have
107610	a full size or a ten keyless which some
110670	people prefer because they want to have
112770	their keyboard laid out like this don't
114810	worry the app when it's here they want
116549	to have your keyboard like this and
118170	their mouse in the mouse pad and then
119579	the number pad over here as opposed to
121350	having it on this side this is actually
122939	in sort of purist terms slightly more
125759	efficient because if you want to get to
127290	your keyboard you go here if you want to
129119	get to a number pad you go here as
130348	opposed to going over the number
132750	get all the way to the keyboard so there
134640	you go um layout wise perfect long
139590	shifts long enter' and long backspace it
141900	has no number lock light so only scroll
145710	locking caps lock but that stands to
147300	reason because it doesn't have number
148620	keys on it and let's have a look at what
152850	switches this is using so Philco
154440	actually sent us a variety of their
156090	keyboards to check out and the right so
159510	what makes this keyboard a quality
161250	keyboard the biggest thing is a the
164400	overall construction of it and hold on
168739	there we go
170190	and B the quality of the switches that
173370	they're using so they're using Cherry MX
174750	which is for all of their keyboards and
177200	that combined with the rigidity of the
180209	deck behind it is what gives you the
181500	more comfortable less fatiguing and
183930	faster typing experience than what you'd
185970	get from a membrane keyboard and
187410	basically unless a keyboard says it's
189900	mechanical then it is a membrane
192420	keyboard all right so here let's cover
194430	everything so this is a body color black
196140	key arrangement 87 key switches are blue
201380	which means that they are quite clicky
203820	and very tactile feeling and we were
206970	actually looking at the box from the
209100	keyboard features n key rollover which
211260	means even if you type with your face it
212820	will actually register all of your
214799	keystrokes which is handy um if you type
217739	with your face it uses a USB or ps2
220080	interface it comes with an adapter the
222060	printing position is front face so
223590	that's what I'm talking about in terms
224970	of the difference in how the keys are
226769	printed so this actually avoids a
228840	problem that a lot of people have with
230280	keyboards and that is fading over time
232560	of the lettering these will never ever
235470	fade so you can clearly read them and
237269	they won't fade and that seems like a
240480	pretty good thing to me right in terms
243360	of the non-slip enos so they've got four
245730	pads down here as well as these are
247799	fairly unique so they've got a rubber
249180	pad that actually rolls all the way
251190	around the outside of this so that even
253230	if you have it elevated it is not going
255450	anywhere whatsoever in terms of included
258000	accessories they give you let's put that
260220	back on they give you two additional
263010	Windows keys these ones with the side
264870	printing as a
266150	- the ones with the embossed windows
268310	logo on the top they give you the key
269690	remover tool and the adapter that I
271940	talked about before it also has a velcro
275930	wrap for the cable itself which is
278210	approximately one Linus arm span in
280460	length which means it's about five and a
282620	half feet or so
284750	so in summary quality key switches so
290210	far out of all the keyboards I've used
292100	in my life this is the best most solid
294860	overall feeling one other than I did
297290	have an IBM model M and nothing can
300080	compare but I actually gave it away so I
302660	probably shouldn't have done that it's
303830	looks looking at me like stricken right
305449	now I really had one it was like an
307729	early 90s one and it was ps2 and it was
311240	just awesome in every possible way
312800	anyway up so other than that one this is
315050	as solid as I felt and this is with the
317389	three fill codes that I've checked out
319220	so far and I really don't know where I
321889	was going with that because then I'm
322940	really sad about my model M but if you
324860	want a good typing experience cherry
326960	blue switches are an excellent choice
328970	personally I find them just fine for
330620	gaming as well although not everyone
332360	likes for gaming here get get close so
336229	you can hear it you hear that actuation
340820	point not everyone likes that sort of
342979	very narrow actuation point there
345470	whereas some of the other switches such
346970	as the Reds of the blacks will have a
349220	more smooth key press experience I love
352760	the noise though and I love the feeling
354560	and the the audio feedback of knowing
357139	that I've pressed it correctly so I yeah
359750	finally just fine for typing just fine
361400	for gaming I type fastest on blues as
363620	well so it is slick so you have to kind
366680	of try things yourself because these are
368300	so customizable get whatever switches
370340	you want whatever key caps you want
371870	whatever layout you want and you end up
374120	with the best typing experience yeah you
375470	pay for it but personally I think it's
377060	worth it don't forget to subscribe to -
