60	thank you daddy brand for sponsoring our
1500	CES 2018 content check out there are six
3780	skins and the link down below
5069	and speaking of SiC we're here at
6720	verdaguer they have their awesome chairs
8550	you guys probably know of them already
9840	they can go left and right they can go
11340	up and down they can go all the way back
13590	there just catches me out every time but
15240	it worked it's fine they support even me
16980	which is actually a good sign
18449	but what's new here today is the RGB
21480	lighting powered by NZXT cam software so
24600	you can control it on your desktop and
26279	it wirelessly connects to the chair it's
27990	all nicely done it has charging through
30269	the back with a breakaway cable so if
32340	you're like running if you're away from
34710	your computer and suddenly you have to
36420	be like oh my god this squads on
38100	counter-strike you can jump into your
39719	care chair hit colton while you're doing
41820	it the cable will break away and you
43770	don't have to worry about the cable
44700	breaking you have to worry about the
45690	chair breaking everything is fine you
47340	can charge your chair that way but if
48899	you do happen to forget to plug in that
50820	super fancy cable you can just swap in
53399	for more 18 650 batteries the same ones
56460	in your vape if you're into that so you
58590	might have a few around those could be
60239	externally rechargeable you could have
61680	an extra set waiting just in case you
63329	forget to plug it in and then you would
65400	be good to go again just through this
66810	nice little simple port on the back the
69000	batteries would go in there in terms of
70860	lighting modes it is powered by cam
72659	software like I previously mentioned so
74340	you have all your standard RGB lighting
76200	modes as you can see here we're just
77970	cycling through a bunch of colors so
79200	it's also breathing and everything else
80820	you would expect from an RGB product but
83400	then they also have a really cool
84930	counterstrike mode which we aren't
86880	currently displaying but you'll be
88110	seeing through b-roll it shows stuff
89610	like when you die it's red if you're at
91950	full health it's green and it gradients
93869	all the way through to paying on what
95040	health percentage you're at if you are
96750	flash banged it'll go white if you stand
99240	in smoke it'll go gray if the bomb is
101280	currently ticking it will go yellow and
103740	tick with the bomb and then when it's 10
106079	seconds left in the bomb it'll go red
107579	and tick with the bomb still which is
108930	actually a really cool feature so at
110670	this point in time I don't know what it
112290	will cost I don't know if it will show
114000	up as an upgrade kit or if it will be
115649	natively in the chairs or possibly both
118200	we'll have to find out at a later date
120360	another thing that they launched here
121950	was coffee fibre material for headrests
124350	and lumbar support cushions as long with
126479	an entire chair if you decide to get the
128369	one that I'm sitting in right now what
129959	the heck is coffee fiber material well
132000	it's actually a synthetic material
133830	with coffee fiber layered on top of it
135960	and what this does is it absorbs odors
138120	it dries faster so if you get a little
140520	sweaty when you're sitting in your chair
141780	it will absorb that and dry that much
143880	more quickly which is cool it's common
145950	in sportswear and clothes because of
147870	again odors and whatnot and it's good
149700	because if you think about what is
151590	currently sitting on your chair
153390	absorbing those odors it's probably a
155490	good idea
156240	also the vertigo your logos on these
158340	things it's a silver coated threading so
160890	that will also kill 99% of germs and
163110	bacteria which is great so if you're
165990	interested in any of the stuff that we
167400	talked about here today the RGB the
169110	coffee fiber whatever keep an eye out at
