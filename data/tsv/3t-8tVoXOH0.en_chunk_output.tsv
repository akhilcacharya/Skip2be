6680	today I have something to unbox that one
9330	of my co-workers actually bought online
11730	and he had it shipped to the office just
15210	because sometimes that's a little bit
16379	more convenient because you know you're
18029	not at home during the day when you have
19590	a nine-to-five job so I saw this thing
23220	and I was like dude do you mind if I
25260	unbox this thing because it's uh it's
27599	pretty hilarious and yeah I thought you
31470	guys might like to check it out so this
33809	is the CTA assault rifle controller for
36660	PlayStation 3
37710	it basically remaps all of the ps3
41399	buttons two buttons on the gun itself it
45000	is powered by a couple of double-a
46500	batteries it uses the trigger as an r1
48360	button it makes a lifelike shooting
50489	sound effects from the built-in speaker
51750	includes a removable scope and stop uses
54870	wireless USB syncing with the ps3
56399	console okay all within reach realistic
59640	look and lightweight construction okay
61440	yeah okay
62250	package includes well we'll see that in
63989	a minute plug in USB dongle key turn on
65790	the rifle and press the PS button to
68640	sing so the assault rifle for the
71490	PlayStation 3 is the number one piece of
73380	equipment any gamer needs to wreak of
76920	this Velvet Rock re EK wreak havoc oh no
81890	to wreak havoc and modern first-person
84630	shooters like call of duty modern
85950	warfare 2 or first-person shooting or
90270	hunting games or assault rifle
92070	controller has every button you need and
93950	I'm having trouble getting the scope out
96390	but we do have the stock alright yeah
98549	I'm feeling pretty good about this stuff
99869	right about now we have the USB dongle
102509	which looks a little something like that
104189	plug that into your PlayStation 3
105630	alright and then let's guy look through
110280	this oh that's a shame ok
113610	yeah I can see like there's kind of a
115409	red hue Tippa to the plastic here but
118409	you can actually see like some junk on
121680	the inside this doesn't actually turn ok
124680	well that's disappointing but I guess
126210	what can you expect for I think regular
128008	prices is like $49.99 and he got it for
132120	something
132600	would like 29.99 so okay let's see if we
136140	can get this on here Oh hold on I hope
138000	I'm not putting it on the wrong way I
139350	think I am okay here we go so don't
144900	worry I'll figure this out you guys
146250	don't worry there's no doubt that I'll
150000	be back in the set okay so when in doubt
152760	force it I just had to push harder and
154770	then to put the stock on you just take
156840	the well it's kind of the butt of the
160200	gun so I was going to call it a butt
161820	plug but then I realized that's not
163290	really very appropriate Bob we'll go
165240	ahead and do it anyway so you take out
167190	the plug and then you go ahead and put
170070	the stock back in so you've got all of
172320	your ps3 buttons here so there's your
174180	square triangle circle and X button
176370	you've also got your l1 and then these
179220	are labels apparently for these buttons
181140	oh yeah I can see how that'd be kind of
182940	handy because that way you can kind of
184170	see what you're doing and you can press
186120	the buttons from yeah from yeah sort of
188220	that kind of an angle you've got your ah
190560	see this is I think this is probably
194190	going to be your right analog stick
196050	would be my guess there's your l2 and
198180	your r2 and then you've got your left
200250	analog stick out here you've got your
202560	d-pad over here which is actually kind
205500	of usable like you can you can kind of
207240	use that you wouldn't use that often in
208560	the context of this device but there it
211200	is it's there and there's your on and
212940	off switch so you know what oh hey
215790	there's more over here so select start
217350	mode off one three and infinite oh cool
221310	so you can have single shot burst fire
223080	and full auto there's the speaker
225860	unfortunately this is a magazine right
228180	not a clip magazine the Russian knows
230280	good magazine right here there's your
232500	trigger button so we are totally going
234840	to have to I hear you guys can look down
236760	the down the sights of the gun just to
238590	appreciate sort of what it looks like
240720	we're totally going to have to throw a
242940	couple double-a batteries in here and
244830	find out what the lifelike shooting
248070	sounds are going to sound like here so
250350	hold on there we go some some of my
253740	trusty eneloop batteries which never let
256200	me down
256798	and
258519	close in there all right oh the lights
261819	go on
262389	so there's your 1 2 3 4 light so
265180	obviously it's not going to bind
266590	hopefully actually makes the noise here
269020	we go oh that's too bad it probably has
272590	to be bound to the ps3 in order to in
275500	order to make the sound effects that's
277030	oh wait it's an off mode okay hold on
283840	hold on we're going to try burst fire
285009	burst fire okay that sounds kind of
294520	similar now let's try infinity mode so
