6840	welcome to
8350	keyboard this is the ultimate s the Das
12820	Keyboard by NetID odd comes in four
16480	different configurations at least at the
18070	time of filming this video there is a
20050	clicky version and then a less clicky
22810	version so if you guys are familiar with
24250	mechanical keyboards you know what
25450	clicky is personally on the clicky guy
26860	not everyone is some people have you
29170	know sleeping babies nearby or annoyed
31539	co-workers nearby and they even if they
33730	want a clicky keyboard they can't have
36129	one so there's that then they have the
39129	professional and the Ultimate Edition
41650	this one right here is the clicky
44460	Ultimate Edition keyboard and what makes
47890	it ultimate well you guys will find out
50559	shortly because there are quite a few
52720	things about this keyboard that I
54159	personally think make it ultimate that
57670	are not necessarily the reason for the
59470	name so it comes with a little cleaning
61059	cloth
61449	that's not very ultimate don't worry
62860	about that it is fully compatible with
65019	Windows Mac and Linux in fact you can
67540	even buy little key set kits that will
70240	change your windows keys over to option
72310	keys if you want one let's see what meta
76030	dot has to say for themselves on the
78490	back and the keys are on the back of the
80049	keyboard on the back of the box here and
81520	mechanical key switches from maximum
83350	speed and comfort this is true in fact
85329	if you go to the - keyboard website they
87490	have a cool little typing test where you
89229	can compete and race with people in real
91659	time and people are on there all the
93250	time
93490	I actually wasted like two hours on it
96009	one night when I was like oh this is
97719	neat so it just automatically starts a
99700	new race and grabs whoever's like like
101770	on there and then you just race against
103719	each other and it records your average
105310	words per minute and all of that cool
106719	stuff so um I tested that with the
109359	mechanical keyboard not one of these
111189	this is my first ask keyboard although
112810	I've played with them before I was
116049	testing it on mechanical keyboard versus
117729	a Logitech G 15 so you know a good
120030	membrane keyboard and what I found for
123490	myself was I was about 15% faster with a
126249	mechanical keyboard my wife who has long
128979	pianist fingers was about 20% faster on
132250	her mechanical keyboard which is not
134170	even a great typing keyboard I'm not
136360	going to name any names but it was
137650	mechanical she
139010	she was about 20% faster than she was on
141200	a membrane keyboard so yes it is faster
143569	and it is more comfortable this is not
146060	open for debate
147620	uses the most advanced german-engineered
149150	gold-plated and slightly kick clicking
151069	mechanical key switches a double in the
152420	industry full and key rollover means
154370	even if you type with your face you
155930	won't accidentally press anything and it
157790	will register every keystroke avoiding
160069	key jamming I think that was more of a
161599	problem on typewriters however it is
163970	still valid on keyboards because it can
166430	you can ruin these issues on poorly made
168709	and poorly designed keyboards with that
170239	great multi-purpose keyboard for fast
172280	typist and gamers alike and just general
174379	elitists for this particular one and
176120	I'll explain why high speed USB 2.0 hub
178340	very cool extra long cable got it
180769	ok got all that got all that and that's
183920	what Daniel Graham where Graham you okay
187190	Daniel if you type eight hours a day it
189200	might be as well be on the best
190400	available keyboard I initially created
191780	this uncompromising keyboard for myself
193700	and now I'm excited to share with you
195879	what makes the ultimate no way no key
208220	labels whatsoever so unless you are
212389	elite typist you cannot use this
215989	keyboard that's right it has a built-in
219549	exclusion of people who aren't as good
222620	at typing as you are factor built right
225290	into it no one can sit down at your
227180	computer and use it unless they prefer
229250	on the keyboard awesome
232150	alright so build quality yes most
236720	mechanical keyboards because they are
238970	intended to be sold at a higher price
240470	are built just playing better than most
244010	membrane keyboards this has always been
246169	true no this is not a model M however
248989	this is pretty much as good as it's
250940	gonna get today in terms of the layout
253699	uh-huh okay so you can see we've got a
256159	pretty standard layout you got your
257389	skate key your function keys
259339	you've got your Tildy your numbers your
261858	backspace your enter your shift your
264020	other shift everything is correctly laid
266090	out as your windows keys and there are
268729	no sort of extra things thrown in
271290	short backspace short shift personally I
273480	find this to be the ideal keyboard
275880	layout you've got a couple keys that are
277590	slightly different from the other ones
278670	there's your dots for your home row so I
280890	mean you probably type without looking
282930	at your keyboard anyway if you're
284070	getting one of these but you know
286950	that'll tell people find your palm row
288600	you've also got a dot in the middle on
290400	the five of the number pad so that you
292890	will also be able to find your home
294120	position on the number pad itself now
296690	why does it the cleaning cloth because
299130	it does have a velocity surface so not
301140	everyone's the biggest fan in the world
302490	of glossy but it does make it look quite
304020	nice you know what let me go find a key
305310	cap remover and I will take off one of
308160	the caps and show you guys the
309300	mechanical switches so we removed one of
312270	the key caps actually one of the things
313890	I like about this keyboard versus one of
315900	the other mechanical keyboards that I
317310	have is that the keys are a little bit
319440	difficult to remove so one of the ones I
322350	have keys will actually pop off while
324240	you're typing sometimes yeah that's on
326580	the the ones my wife uses sorry guys I'm
329940	just talking to slick so yeah that's
332340	sort of inconvenient in fact once I was
334740	cleaning her keyboard and I was like
336630	vacuuming it to get the dust out from in
338580	between the keys I vacuumed up a key
341460	which wouldn't even have been that bad
343590	if I'd been using like a portable vac
345420	but I was using a built-in vac so I had
348540	to go all the way down to the garage
350270	pull the entire full reservoir off of it
355230	and dig through like years of dead skin
360510	cell accumulation and dog hair to find
363540	the key so anyway long story short it's
367170	good that the keys stay on moving right
371070	along right blue keys so I think it is
373650	fairly optimistic of gasps keyboard to
376410	say that they're slightly clicky because
377880	blue keys blue key switches are
379980	extremely clicky and they're my favorite
382950	because they feel so good to type on and
387290	here we go
388680	blue keys are whatever
391680	blue keys are generally the preferred
393690	key key switches of typists however
396840	there's no reason that gamers wouldn't
398640	also enjoy them as well personally I
400320	don't find that the key cats make
402449	- the difference to the gaming
403529	experience whereas with typing it is
405809	night and day it's night and day going
407969	from membrane to mechanical and then
409889	it's night and day going from any
411839	mechanical keyboard to the one that
413699	really suits your style the best so what
416580	makes them clicky is the fact that they
418319	are okay they like they reach up they
422969	reach a threshold point here give them
424770	really close so no noise here then you
428099	reach a threshold that is where the key
430559	activates and then it has some more
431939	travel down to the base so you actually
434009	don't even have to fully depress them in
436289	order to type comfortably on it but if
438389	you want to you can bottom them out as
440249	well so if you have a neighbor who
442169	doesn't want to listen to you typing all
443550	the time this is not the keyboard for
448050	you but I say get it anyway because it's
450060	really comfortable and really awesome
451110	and who cares what they think anyway so
453539	thank you for checking out my unboxing
455249	of what I personally believe is like I
458159	said the ultimate elitist keyboard the
