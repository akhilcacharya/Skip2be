380	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
3090	the G 500 s from Logitech now I've
5609	checked out the G 400 s and the G 100 s
7830	and quite frankly this is the one that
10050	I'm genuinely excited about because
11790	there's some Logitech features that I
14009	really felt we're missing from the other
15690	ones that I guess you just got to kind
17580	of you got to pay to play and if you
20010	wanted to get access to them you had to
21720	go for the premium G 500s so let's take
24330	a look at the overall specs really quick
26189	so it does everywhere from 200 to 8200
28680	dpi this is a laser mouse and it is
31019	serious business about the DPI is I mean
33120	I don't think you'll ever really use
34380	8200 dpi but if you wanted to this mouse
37350	is capable of actually getting a useful
40739	input if it's traveling at 4 meters per
43379	second which if you think of it in terms
45239	of like if you're a low sensitivity
46530	gamer and you were going 4 meters per
48809	second to do like a turn you'd have to
50670	basically go like wow you'd have to like
52829	jump and spin in order to actually trip
55469	this Mouse out and have it not work so
57390	there you go up to a thousand reports
59160	per second which is the maximum USB is
61170	capable of max acceleration of 30 GS
63870	20 million clicks is what the buttons
66030	are rated for and the feet are rated for
68130	250 kilometers now I kind of mocked them
70110	with the 250 kilometers in my g5 our G
72780	400s unboxing and I was like well do
74820	they mean on ashphalt or do they mean on
77479	a piece of glass but it looks like
80549	they've actually thought of that tested
82259	on wood veneer desktop so they actually
84869	tested it before they rated it for how
87840	long it's actually going to go for so
90360	there you go I thought I thought that
91860	was interesting if nothing else so the
93210	first Mouse I ever used with adjustable
94890	weights was a Logitech mouse and I
96630	really felt like that feature separates
99000	it in terms of customized ability from
101369	the other things on the market I mean
103290	nowadays a lot of mice have adjustable
106170	weights or like you know adjustable you
109640	know wrist straps or whatever kinds of
113009	adjustable things that go on but for me
115799	personally I would rather find a mouse
118170	that is truly sculpted in the shape that
121110	I want and then I can tune the weight
124259	because that's the thing that matters
125579	most to me so they've gone with the sort
127979	of classic Logitech weight system which
129869	is a cartridge that loads in from the
132270	back at the rear get it cartridge loads
136650	on ok nevermind so there's a cartridge
138480	that loads into here which is where we
139980	found the the battery insert for the old
141989	g7 which I still have one I'm kicking
144870	around somewhere and then there's a
146610	little eject button right there that
147870	kicks it out
148560	the naught of the slippy feed on the
150810	bottom are at the front side and back
153239	and let's go ahead and get these opened
155129	up I'm going to need a minute for that
156209	though so the most is lightweight
157830	without feeling cheap and it really
159959	doesn't it feels very solidly built
162019	however you can add up to whatever nine
165420	times three you can add up to 27 grams
167730	to the mouse which will put it at the
169440	heavier end of of mice and then what you
173790	can also do is you can adjust where you
175860	want the weight so if you put more of
177330	the weight towards the front you'll have
179069	a bit more of a front heavy Mouse what I
180599	would probably do personally is I'd load
182340	more of the weight towards the back so
184140	that I can more easily move this way
186870	which is the way that I tend to use my
188790	mouse even though it's sort of bad for
190319	your wrist and you don't really supposed
191610	to do that so a lot of Tech's whole
193050	thing with the new G series is their
195090	science wins branding where they're
197129	talking about the advanced materials
198690	that they're using on the mouse now the
200400	difference between the G 500s and the G
202260	400s
203599	aside from the fact that this is using a
206099	gaming grade laser sensor as opposed to
208110	the optical sensor the G 400 is that the
210470	grippy sides feel more rugged and they
214379	feel more robust on the G 500s like I
216569	actually don't think I can scratch any
219330	of this off even if I go straight at it
220799	with a fingernail this was the one
222269	complaint I had about the g9 which was
224280	otherwise my second favorite Mouse ever
226290	because it's awesome was that like the
229170	anti-slip coating just came off about a
233159	year into owning it and I really just I
235110	don't feel like this would happen with
236549	this but it's impossible to say without
238709	waiting a little bit a little bit longer
240930	so other Logitech features that I feel
243269	very strongly about this guy right here
244739	the unlocked scroll wheel love to see
247950	that implemented it's things like back
250530	and forward buttons unlock scroll wheel
253459	outstanding precision that really set
255680	apart from another one so all you have
257180	to do see that so you can probably you
260060	can hear there's actual clicks to the
262460	mouse wheel now you go ahead and press
264139	this and it disengages the gear and it
267650	spins freely so it's great for scrolling
269780	through long documents I actually used
271430	my g9 at work almost exclusively because
274400	of that because I was often in long
276650	Excel documents but the problem with the
278090	g9 is the bat was on the bottom which is
280009	not as good as having the button right
281810	here where you can decide what mode do I
283880	want to be in and you can change it on
285169	the fly you've also got dpi changing
287270	buttons here back forward as well as
288919	another programmable button here on the
291410	side looks like yep we've got dpi
295669	indications here so that has one two
298430	three settings and you can program all
300139	of that in the Logitech software I just
302720	want to see if there's anything that I
303860	forgot that I wanted to say I don't know
305570	if I mentioned the three year warranty
306800	already but there you go and I think
310639	that's pretty much it
311389	oh yeah you can reprogram all the
312500	buttons if you want and unlike the G
314660	100's and the G 400s the cable is
317360	braided so it's got that premium braided
319760	look and it is less susceptible to
321860	damage from caps I've actually had
324169	cables saved from cats vibrating so
328669	there you go it's a thing don't forget
330949	to subscribe plan its act extra boxing's
332449	reviews and other computer videos
