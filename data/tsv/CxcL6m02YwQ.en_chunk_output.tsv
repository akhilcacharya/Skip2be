7520	welcome to my unboxing of the azio
9990	levitron mech for gaming keyboard this
12930	actually has some pretty unique features
14820	at a pretty unique price point and let's
17070	start with a warm welcome for our guests
20310	camera operator who is also interviewing
22380	for the tech tips assistant job so
24390	hopefully he does pretty well operating
25920	the camera here he's given me a kind of
27240	a weird look from behind the camera so
28770	that's a good sign
29610	okay why don't we start with the main
31770	features which are the cherry black
33320	mechanical switch keys so that is okay
37440	according to a CEO why don't we go with
38910	what they think widely believed to
40920	provide the best gaming experience
42440	fascinating okay
43800	modular design adds functionality by
46410	attaching modular accessories numeric
48510	keypad and macro key pad modules are
51060	included interesting and it has
53280	anti-ghosting so there is actually an
54899	anti ghosting zone I'm gonna go ahead
56399	and flip it over and so you can see your
58649	WASD zat x CQ e key zone is all anti
62850	ghosted so while this keyboard does not
65218	feature any key rollover by any stretch
67320	of the imagination it does have an anti
69930	ghosting zone which is where you're
71070	going to be pressing most of your keys
72510	in gaming so unless you type with your
74700	face you're probably not going to run
77280	into any issues as far as ghosting is
79350	concerned now the features are all
81060	listed here but what I'd really like to
82619	do is get the box opened before we just
86580	start listing features so I can show you
88320	where they are on the keyboard itself
91290	now one thing as you did ask that I
93690	mentioned on this unboxing is the use of
97070	cardboard packaging which is recyclable
100700	versus styrofoam packaging which is not
104820	recyclable so there you go I have
106619	mentioned it so you can clearly see the
108689	cardboard packaging present here the
110700	highly recyclable cardboard practic
112470	acajou okay Quick Start Guide is in
114869	color look at that so they show you how
116490	to install the software manual as well
118500	as installing the software to manage
121110	your profiles as well as your macro
122820	settings in key customization all right
125220	what else we got here okay so they all
126810	look at that it's like it's an actual
128549	color manual and it's a start it's a
130649	QuickStart guide that says more than
132470	plug the thing into the thing and then
135360	turn it on awesome okay so there is your
138420	manual as well as your soft Barlow
140069	you're going to
140470	download the latest software from the
141910	Ezio website here are some modular
145410	pieces including a number pad very nice
149580	it's got a good feel to it already
151870	calculator so there's a button to this
154420	open up the calculator program which is
155950	this is a good place for it I'm liking
157690	that okay there's the USB interface and
160000	there's the USB interface on the other
161800	side so I'll show you why it has to in
163330	just a moment here's a way - oh cool so
165910	you can attach it by an extension cord -
167950	so it basically comes with this is like
173080	the smartest thing ever actually I'm
175630	really impressed right about now so look
179410	at this you can either clip it directly
181540	to the keyboard or you can go ahead and
183760	plug it in by USB somewhere else
186630	these are like 15 bucks 20 bucks if you
189130	want to buy one so it comes with your
190750	keyword cool all right here's a little
193510	macro key piece so this one is going to
196630	clip on to the keyboard and it's gonna
198730	add some additional macro keys so I'll
200380	show you where those go I don't think
201459	those are mechanical but I'll let it go
203350	this time
203910	alright honestly I think it's a little
207010	bit overdone the whole partial
209380	mechanical versus full mechanical and
211540	how it's you know sinful to do it one
214420	way versus the other way think oh that's
217540	just my opinion nobody watches this
220150	channel to hear my opinion so I'll keep
222100	it to myself okay actually I lied people
226360	do watch this channel to hear my opinion
227860	so there you go that's my opinion
229269	this is the levitron neck for the first
232390	thing I noticed about it is it is built
234760	like a mechanical keyboard it's got some
237160	text to it it has some weight let's do
239470	the overall appearance first so we've
240970	got aw look at that two different stems
244239	so you can either put it up a little bit
245769	like that or you can put it up a lot
249850	like that or you can put it up not at
253930	all like like that we've also got rubber
257950	feet on the bottom so there's rubber bit
259630	along the bottom of both of these is
261130	actually like really nice little touches
262720	like this rubber feet here and then
266190	rubber feet here so if you have it
268960	running flat it is completely rubber
271300	grip affine so it's not
273180	move on your table regardless of what
275460	configuration you are using overall
279090	layout let's uh let's have a look at
280979	some of the custom keys we've got so we
282389	can turn the Windows key on and off here
283889	we can switch between macro profile a
286500	and B here and the macro keys are
290070	actually on different heights I want you
291750	to get down at a bat yeah at that level
294690	there so you can see how these are
297000	actually kind of staggered so you can
299130	actually feel if you run your if you
301979	were to run your fingers down them or if
303600	you were to reach for them which key is
305759	which because they are all at slightly
307650	different heights so that's something
309449	that may not seem like a big deal to the
311639	casual observer but personally I think
313770	it's a very big deal because the last
316770	thing you want is macro keys that you
318630	cannot feel in the midst of a firefight
322080	ok cable we've got our standard sort of
325500	sleeve look in the USB cable we've got
327419	to bundle together in one here so I'm
329759	guessing one of these is for the hub yep
332460	and one of them is for the keyboard
334139	itself it doesn't tell you which is
335280	which but my guess is that you'll plug
337770	both of them in anyway so I'm not too
339419	worried about that on the back we do
341610	find the USB hub that I did refer to
344099	before and let's see what else we got
347099	going on here so you know what I'm
349050	moving I'm just gonna pull my cheat
351060	sheet out and kind of run through with
353849	you guys so they've got a volume knob
355020	which is right about here alright our
358380	anti-ghosting allows for six keys to be
361889	simultaneously pressed for USB expansion
364500	we have two USB expansion ports which I
366210	showed you before the Windows key we saw
368610	each key has its own mechanical switch
370440	the advantages registers without pushing
372659	the key all the way down and the keys
374789	snaps back to the original position
376530	faster they are rated for 50 million
378389	keystrokes so I can sit here and I could
379919	do this all day and probably never wear
381840	it out the numeric keypad keypad yes
384509	okay so let's show you guys this so I
386550	showed you this way which is like this
389070	already so then I can put it over here
392099	if I want but there's also another way
394349	to hook this up I can go like this I'm
397050	just gonna make sure that I have it
399840	configuration as the keyboard itself and
403470	okay I don't know how this works I've
405760	never tried this before so bear with me
407320	here you guys I'm just gonna go ahead
409600	I'm gonna try and figure out there we go
413830	so there you go you can clip the keypad
417060	and that's mechanical too you can click
419980	the keypad on to that side or you can
422920	take the whole thing off
425220	comes off somehow okay now it's on there
428500	pretty good does it lock in place oh yes
430150	it does
430810	there we go and it locks up here too
434260	there we go or you can put it on the
436240	other side so depending on the
438040	configuration of your desk you can
440230	actually change the overall width of
444280	your keyboard or which side of your
446620	gaming Keys it is wider on very very
449860	cool all right
451510	modular design ah modular rail ha
455470	enables the macro d-pad to be adjustable
458200	in positioning and allows future modules
460630	to be hooked on the same rail so this
462730	rail up here which looks kind of like
464470	for mounting sights on a gun and this
467080	kind of looks like sights doesn't it
468400	yeah can I ignore the keyboard keys on
471580	them so you just slide these along here
474420	and they click into place wherever you
478390	happen to want to put them so you want
479680	to put them here let's say you never use
481720	the f1 to have four keys while you're
483700	gaming and let's face it who does I mean
485500	I'm sure there's some sort of weird game
487510	out there that requires the use of f4
490120	key you know I don't know maybe f10 but
496150	then you know you couldn't do whatever
497380	functionality you're trying to figure
498670	out how to do in counter-strike when
500140	people tell you how to do it right so
501220	okay so this allows you to actually
504490	reach it if you needed to so maybe you
507310	have like an alternate WASD that you
509590	want to put in for I don't know what I
511600	don't question what they're actually for
513940	the point is just you have six macro
516610	keys here six macro keys here with a and
519460	B so that's a total of twelve functions
521229	and it's all within reach of your actual
524410	gaming keys unlike keyboards that have
526810	banks of macro keys over here or on the
529780	other side whatever the case may be
531960	now you can reach them all very neat all
534510	right 11 dedicated macro keys we just
536580	went through that water-resistant seals
538440	and drainage holes built in this I
542250	didn't know spilling your drink on your
544110	keyboard is no longer an excuse for
545610	losing traders holes they are 1 2 3 4 4
552209	drainage holes uh-uh
553970	and simply keep playing as the liquid
558690	will come out from the bottom view of
559950	the drainage holes now if you spill
561330	something sticky I still wouldn't expect
563370	it to work a hundred percent what you
565050	might have to do at that point is take
566670	like some rubbing alcohol and then pour
568290	that down after it mind you that might
570390	you know wreck any you know rubber or
573480	whatever happens to be in it ok so the
575670	whole thing is not good still try not to
577050	spill on your keyboard please or drink
578370	water around your keyboard at the very
580529	least operated in gold connectors we
582899	talked about that already fully
585209	programmable all keys can be
587880	reprogrammed not just the dedicated
590160	macro keys very cool so the first thing
592709	some people are gonna say is Windows key
594839	we don't need no stinking Windows key
596610	but you could actually just change that
598709	to do whatever you want including the
601200	tab key the caps lock key in fact one of
603839	my big gripes about keyboards tends to
606690	be short backspace keys well I'll
608220	probably just reprogram this to be a
609810	backspace key and then my problem is
611670	solved actually let's look at the
615089	overall layout while we're at it then
616470	we've got nice long Enter shift shift
619610	normal size control and also the one
622230	thing that I don't like about the layout
624029	is the short backspace key but the fully
626400	programmable functionality really does
628350	help to make me forgive it for that ok
631680	and I think that's pretty much all there
634350	is that I have to say about the levitron
636930	neck 4 with the aggressive pricing the
639300	very full feature set the one thing it
641880	doesn't have is backlit keys although
644610	it's arguable whether that is necessary
647010	or not especially with all of these
649079	other things that it does include so
650700	thank you for checking out my unboxing
