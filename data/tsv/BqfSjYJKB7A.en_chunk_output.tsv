30	wireless mouse technology has gotten
2190	crazy good lately with even professional
5940	gamers cutting the cord in tournament
8340	play with thousands tens of thousands or
11250	even hundreds of thousands of dollars on
13200	the line but what about mechanical
15120	keyboards both mechanical keyboards and
17789	wireless keyboards have existed since
20100	before I was born so where the 80 double
23519	hockey sticks are although wireless
25859	mechanical boards well I'm glad you
29340	asked
29939	meet the g6 one three it's tournament
33899	grade mechanical wireless and it lasts
37410	for months on a single charge game on
40739	and on and on and on and on and I'm
54329	carrying too many phones right now HP's
56579	new omen X lineup comes equipped with
58890	Intel seventh generation Core i7
60809	processor check it out at the link in
63210	the video description even though it's
65188	part of their gamer G Series I think the
68790	best way to describe the design of
70619	Logitech G 613 is utilitarian it's got
74790	pretty much everything you need and very
77850	little that you don't it rocks an
79890	understated two-tone gray finish with an
82590	integrated wrist rest which is nice
84420	because you don't want that thing
85259	flopping around when you're on the go
87000	it's got six programmable macro keys and
89670	then a handful of basic media keys being
92700	Wireless it also has an on/off switch
94950	and these two buttons that let you
97110	switch between the Logitech Lightspeed
99240	receiver unit plugged into your computer
100650	and a supported nearby bluetooth device
104009	like your phone car TV you get the point
108570	Bluetooth is a fairly ubiquitous
109680	standard and that's a nice thing to have
111750	let's talk typing Logitech is using the
114360	same Omron co-developed Roemer G
116909	switches as the g9 10 but this time
120060	without the weird-shaped key caps RGB
123329	lighting and the phone dock so it
126090	shouldn't be a surprise then that while
127890	the high tactile bump is a bit of an
129840	acquired taste typing on it is actually
132450	a real
132840	bleep pleasant experience no complaints
134970	there at all as for gaming logitech
137459	claims that thanks to the 2.4 gigahertz
140340	light speed connection same as on the g
142769	703 Mouse which you can check out here
144810	the short actuation distance of the
147480	Romer G switches and the fast onboard
150390	processing that the keyboard is over
152580	five times faster than razors wired
154980	BlackWidow v2 and Ed's opinion after
157739	gaming on it is it's fine just fine so
160790	considering what a regular wired
162870	mechanical keyboard cost a few years ago
164700	not too bad for a hundred and fifty
166829	bucks that's progress but that leads us
169829	back to our original question how has it
173040	taken until twenty freaking seventeen
175380	for a major brand to release a wireless
178079	mechanical keyboard okay so maybe it was
181620	a demand issue until the last few years
184890	mechanical keyboards were a super niche
187470	item and even today most laypersons
190140	don't know what they are so who would
193019	have been out there looking for a
194220	keyboard that's both mechanical and
196220	wireless maybe it was cost the people
199980	looking for those features also had to
202530	be willing to pay for them and
203970	considering that a cheap wireless
205950	keyboard can cost three times as much as
208200	a cheap wired one the fact that a basic
210840	mechanical keyboard is still a hundred
212730	bucks makes that potentially pretty
214889	scary math no no actually I reject that
218489	we don't think it was demand or cost
221459	keeping wireless mechanical keyboards
223470	from hitting the mainstream clearly if
225660	there are people out there buying $200
228440	individually handcrafted key caps some
231959	of them would be willing to spend a few
233669	bucks for a completely wireless desk
235919	setup we think it was more to do with
239669	the limited benefit of wireless for
242579	keyboards I mean they just sit there and
245099	the compromises that were imposed
247799	especially by older wireless
250049	technologies but hold on a second Linus
252419	I mean the 2.4 gigahertz or Bluetooth
255180	wireless devices I have have basically
257728	no noticeable latency aren't those good
260339	enough while I see your point
262849	basically is
264870	good enough the people who buy
266790	mechanical keyboards are enthusiasts
269520	they care about registering a keystroke
271889	a fraction of a second earlier than
273960	their opponents and they're not about to
276330	sacrifice those key benefits just to cut
279930	a cord that's usually out of the way
282630	anyway I mean who exactly is it out
285810	there that wants to charge a heavy-ass
287729	keyboard all the time for the privilege
289949	of being able to pick it up and go sit
291810	on the couch to use it so that's what's
294090	changed here
294960	better than wired latency with up to 18
297930	months of life on two regular double-a
300870	batteries there's even a pair included
302639	in the box
303270	and while Logitech's been super
305340	tight-lipped about exactly how their
307530	Lightspeed link actually works what we
310320	do know is that it's strong high decibel
313169	signal one millisecond report rate and
316160	supremely powerful design is what
318810	enables this products no compromises
322380	performance and endurance with that said
325650	no compromises is in the eye of the
328500	beholder and while the cordless
330360	simplicity of the g6 13 will appeal to
333780	some consumers many enthusiasts will be
337020	unwilling to give up creature comforts
339300	like auxiliary screens pass-through USB
342510	ports built-in audio backlit keys and
345960	let's face it that sweet RGB nectar all
349410	things that they could have at this
351570	price if they were willing to plug in a
353820	court not to mention that they'd
355860	probably get better keycaps to to say I
358680	was disappointed that the legend on a
361400	$150 keyboard uses cheapo stickers would
365039	be a gross understatement but come on -
368250	they got to keep the cost of this
369660	revolutionary new product down somehow
371820	right right no I mean to be cleared by
376050	and large I like the product that I
378660	think a lot of people are gonna buy it
380130	but Logitech at risk of sounding like a
382979	broken record here you guys need to stop
385470	screwing up the key caps on your roller
388080	G key switch products this thing uses
391169	more durable double shots and it's like
393690	25 bucks
395639	anchors Powercore to 20,000 portable
