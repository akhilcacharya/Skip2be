7100	by popular demand we have the
9590	SteelSeries Sens day which is the
11420	replacement for the zai both of which
14030	are cruel jokes for gamers who have a
18260	bit of a list like myself alright so
20900	let's open up this bad boy and take out
24380	the most will find a braided cord we
26810	find a bag of do not eat and what else
31609	do we have
32090	oh oh documentation all right all right
35420	and then we've got the mouse itself so
37400	it is the replacement for the zai as I
40520	mentioned before so what makes the
42379	essence' special compared to the zai
45079	well I will get into that in a moment
47300	let's have a look at what's included
48710	first this is a Quick Start Guide and
50180	that's a stick Quick Start Guide look at
51859	that so in a bunch of different
53480	languages because SteelSeries does sell
55579	worldwide so that's one reason why they
57140	might do that got some features got some
59750	firmware update instructions on most
62359	menu systems okay cool cool cool I'll go
64340	through that a little bit when we're
65480	looking at the mouse itself and then we
67340	have a SteelSeries catalog which
69200	includes a bunch of stuff including as i
72530	saw on the back some stuff that's not
74570	even out yet their Diablo 3 stuff which
76640	is coming it looks really cool okay so
79210	the sensei itself it's got some we
82640	didn't really look at the box much we've
83930	got a couple of professional gamer
85310	testimonials one from Patrick Karn Seth
88159	okay he's the Swedish Swedish national
90979	team captain and then we've also got
92360	grubby on here who's a Warcraft 3 guru
94610	all right finally we've got ok
97250	SteelSeries what they have to say for
99079	themselves so ambidextrous shape and
101180	comfortable grip coating I can vouch for
102560	that because the grip is actually and
105020	the shape is actually the same as the
107360	zai which preceded it ok it has a 32-bit
111020	ARM processor on board which makes it
113090	according to SteelSeries the most
114469	customizable gaming most ever built
116600	you can enable advanced on ok they've
118759	enabled advanced advanced on mouse
120680	calculations it allows unprecedented
123439	personal setups and millisecond response
125000	times it was born for tournament victory
127100	and built to help you win okay what else
128869	we got here in terms of the overall
130310	feature set so economic yes yes ah they
133580	claim it is optimized for all types palm
136360	claw and fingertip grip okay
139570	no palm paw and swipe actually swipe I'm
142700	not familiar with so if anyone is a
145150	youtuber out there who wants to comment
147170	on the video and link me what swipe grip
149480	is I would be very much obliged all
151580	right it has programmable illumination
153440	16.8 million color options that is
155840	enabled on your mouse wheel here on your
158620	okay on the sigh this was the DPI toggle
161330	but I don't know what it does on the
162440	sensei and then finally on the
164570	SteelSeries logo at the back you can
166070	change those to whatever color you want
167900	instant effortless setup via the
170030	built-in LCD on the bottom so you can
172550	have up to five gaming profiles as well
174230	as SteelSeries exact tech precision
176240	settings which I'm going to talk about a
177410	little bit after because that is one of
179330	the reasons that SteelSeries is still my
182090	preferred Mouse of choice okay Mouse of
185570	choice of preferred mouse you can't
186710	really say both but I haven't Akari lays
188390	around my desk at home and I love it and
190610	it is because of the SteelSeries
192260	software LCD supports user personalized
195230	bitmaps so actually this is kind of cool
196670	check this out you can actually put on
199550	little like logos and stuff down there
201350	that's something that I don't believe
202910	was enabled on my Akari laser so there
205310	you go they've updated that particular
207080	feature and you can double your mouth
208310	speed with DCPI from fifty seven hundred
210890	to eleven point four thousand CPI
214630	fascinating okay supported by steel
217250	series engine technology offering
218600	operation configuration customization
220280	and advanced macros across the steel
222230	series peripherals also let you guys
223790	have a look at the overall specs here so
226070	there's your counts per inch which is
227840	steel series what they claims is a more
230660	accurate way of measuring compared to
232990	dpi which is what everyone else uses
235640	which is dots per inch okay one of the
238130	other cool things that about the CPI
241150	concept itself from steel series is that
243320	they believe you should have the utmost
244610	control and you can actually adjust your
247250	counts per inch all the way from one
249320	which would be just phenomenally slow up
252380	to fifty seven hundred in one increment
255890	so you see a lot of mice that offer you
257630	six hundred eight hundred 1000 dpi
259670	settings and those are all preset you
261680	can't really alter them well steel
263000	series actually allows you to adjust in
264710	increments of one absolutely whatever
267230	you desire so let's take some closer
269360	looks at the mouse itself
270650	you got your forward and your back
272150	buttons here
273169	for your right-handed people and then
275330	you've got your forward and back buttons
277039	here for your left-handed people so it
278689	is truly ambidextrous remember to though
281300	if you're right-handed you can also
282620	reach these buttons with your pink here
284060	with your ring finger if you want to go
285319	ahead and use those for macros or you
288139	know copy paste or you know in-game
290389	functions whatever the case may be
291770	finally up here you've got what is also
294199	a programmable button but I believe by
296180	default it's which is the CPI you've got
298939	your mouse wheel and you have your left
300439	and your right clicks on the bottom you
302990	see your SteelSeries gaming grade engine
305509	which I believe they mean laser okay so
308240	that's your laser sensor on the bottom
309800	of the mouse and you've got your usual
311509	slippy feet those are your nonstick
314089	surfaces which are very durable if my
316339	Akari is anything to go by which I've
318439	had actually for a couple years now we
320509	also got a SteelSeries sticker with it
322129	and last but not least I did want to say
324529	a little bit of something about the
326479	settings in the SteelSeries software so
329870	there's a few different things as exact
331279	cents so that is what I talked about
332960	before with the exact CPI setting
334909	there's free move which allows you to
336740	adjust motion correction personally I
338719	hate motion correction although some
341629	gamers feel differently about it one way
343430	or another I turn this all the way off
345469	and I love having this option where I
347930	can turn off angle snapping I can turn
349699	off prediction and I don't have to deal
351259	with that exactly where I move the mouse
353210	is exactly where I want it to go folks I
355370	don't want any compensation and
356689	SteelSeries allows me to do that that's
359990	actually pretty much it oh these are
362089	kind of neat exact acceleration I've
364099	never used this before but the
365719	acceleration works by increasing the CPI
367460	as the mouse is moved quickly and then
369319	there's exact aim which actually reduces
371330	the CPI as the mouse's move slowly
373009	allowing users to focus in on targets
375110	personally I prefer a more linear
376729	response but feel free to play around
378770	with those settings so you can get the
380060	most out of your sensei at least they do
381830	offer the option thank you for checking
383449	out my unboxing of the sensei as you
385099	guys can probably tell at this point bit
386719	of a SteelSeries mouse fanboy so I'm
388279	really looking forward to playing around
390020	with this guy very excited so I just
393229	want to show you guys the lighting
394399	effect on the sensei and I've got it on
396199	a test bench which I'm very excited
397879	about dual GTX 590 s gigabyte g1
400819	assassin 990 X Extreme Edition anyway so
403789	that's the kind of gaming hardware
404810	hopefully you can
406000	you can hook your sensei up to so
407950	there's the SteelSeries logo on the back
409480	there's the indicator up here and then
412540	you can see also the lighting on this
414220	each side of the mouse wheel so it's not
417460	super dark in here so the lighting
418750	effects are quite bright on there there
421000	you have it thank you for checking out
422020	my unboxing and don't forget to

424390	boxing's reviews and other computer
