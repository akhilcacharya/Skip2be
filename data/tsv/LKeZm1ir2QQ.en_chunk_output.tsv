30	dbrand makes great precision cut vinyl
2820	skins for your mobile devices game
4440	consoles and game controllers you can
6120	check them out at the link in the video
7440	description so we are here in the
11490	gigabyte booth where they are focused
13769	mostly on their server stuff and this is
17010	my first encounter with an AMD epic
20369	server out in the wild like not actually
23519	at AMD's headquarters so this guy right
25890	here is got 6 nvme and 18 SATA drives it
29760	accepts up to 2 32 cores 64 thread epoch
33719	servers for a total of 128 threads not
38370	to mention that it can hold up to 4
41180	terabytes of memory if you've got oh I
44309	don't know about a hundred and fifteen
45809	thousand dollars to spend on your Ram
48210	Prayer system this one is designed more
51000	around versatility so you can throw a
53039	couple of Radeon Instinct mi-25 cards in
56039	the back throw some storage and throw
58050	some randon whatever the case may be but
60539	we're gonna see some really interesting
62129	designs moving forward with epic because
64140	as big data becomes more ubiquitous
66229	memory to store that information during
68850	processing becomes more and more
70490	important so high density high bandwidth
74189	memory solutions are an extreme demand
76770	right now and AMD is providing more no
79740	memory capacity and Mongo memory
82049	bandwidth and they're doing it
83430	relatively speaking on the cheap so
86759	Intel is currently charging about
89659	$10,000 for their flagship Xeon scalable
93000	while AMD is topping out at around
95960	$4,200 and changing gears entirely
99979	there's even more to be excited about so
102540	let's have a quick look at this guy
103680	right here in the same to you form
105600	factor this guy takes two Intel Xeon
108630	Platinum CPUs up to 24 dims and up to
113610	eight just perfectly normal GPUs each
117270	running at PCI
118740	16x thanks to these little riser boards
121799	with plx chips on them
123479	now hold on Linus you're talking about
125280	Intel all of a sudden epic comes back
127680	into the picture here because thanks to
129360	epics 128 PCI Express Lanes gigabyte has
134190	told us that they're actually planning a
136080	follow up to this particular model with
139110	a single epic CPU so not only could you
141810	be saving money on the CPUs you're
143730	buying you could actually be buying half
146310	as many of them with tons of memory
149489	bandwidth and tons of GPU support with
152220	no speed compromise so on a large scale
155760	these cost savings are going to be
158190	making huge waves in the deep learning
161700	space and on the subject of making huge
165299	waves dbrand has shaken up the vinyl
167940	skin industry I don't even know if you
169769	can call it a vinyl skin industry
171239	anymore because like who else even
172560	exists at this point over a deep brand
174660	you can get precision cut genuine 3 on
176910	vinyl skins for your phone your game
179010	console your mobile device and you can
180599	use their fantastic configurator to see
183269	exactly what it's going to look like
185310	when it arrives mixing and matching
187019	finishes and colors as you see fit their
190350	products are affordable they ship
192209	worldwide and you guys can check them
