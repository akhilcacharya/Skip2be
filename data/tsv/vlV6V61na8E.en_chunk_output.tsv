30	yeah it's that time of year CES you guys
2790	have had videos up the wazoo in your sub
5310	box for the last few days but you just
7350	didn't have time to watch them all
8550	fortunately people do round ups so here
11700	are the five best intel desktops that
14009	you couldn't see in their dedicated
16320	videos brought to you by intel first up
19320	is the asus strix GL 12 it's a pre built
22320	that's geared for pro gamers and
24210	tournaments it features up to an Intel
26550	Core i7 8700 K and a GTX 1080 an acrylic
30539	side panel that looks pretty darn close
32579	to tempered glass are a sync RGB of
35430	course and the coolest feature a
38040	swappable SSD compartment in the front
40469	you might be thinking who needs that
42450	well it's actually for gaming
44879	tournaments so that organizers can
46530	easily load up the systems with all the
48510	games and settings that they need but if
51180	you're looking for something more
52170	professional and maybe in a smaller form
54390	factor MSI has got you covered with
56850	their new W 25 a workstation in their
60230	incredibly small two and a half liter
62760	case basically everything about it is
65400	undisclosed but we can make some
67770	educated guesses so we know it's got a
70320	Xeon processor so we could say it'll
73350	probably be something with a similar TDP
75630	to the 8700 series chip in the gaming
78570	version and we know it's got an
81090	undisclosed NVIDIA Quadro perhaps volta
84150	based whichever way it ends up it is
86520	awesome to see this much power in such a
88710	small form factor if you're looking for
91350	something small but you want water
93210	cooling well the digital storm spark
95369	might be what you're after
96960	this case is only 4.7 liters in volume
99840	but it has hardline liquid cooling to
103290	keep its internals up to an Intel Core
105570	i7 8700 K and a GTX 1080 cool and boy is
110850	this thing ever sexy other features
113009	include triple m dot to drive mounts
115920	optional custom paint jobs and a 92
119219	millimeter radiator in the top to
121259	dissipate all that heat if you have
123600	space to spare though the Acer predator
125310	Orion 9000 we'll be sure to take up well
129449	a lot of it this thing though can hold
131670	up to a hundred and
132860	eight gigs of DDR four quad-channel RAM
135140	and Intel Core I 918 core processor dual
139970	GTX 10 ADT eyes and then up top a dual
143630	120 millimeter red to keep your CPU cool
146630	the outside complements the bonk doodles
149420	components with full RGB lighting a
151370	headphone holder a DVD drive because why
154040	not and wheels so you can roll up to
157010	your next land party in style but
158959	getting back to smaller things coming in
160880	at just one point two liters you could
163400	actually fit a hundred and twelve of
165709	Intel's haiti's Canyon nooks inside the
169400	orion 9000 this thing features up to an
172160	Intel Core i7 80 809 G with a TDP of a
176239	hundred watts graphics for this thing
178850	are taken care of by a Radeon rx Vega
182090	mgh with 24 compute units and four gigs
185780	of HBM to memory making this little guy
188450	capable of driving a full-fledged VR
191300	experience additionally whether you're
193880	into blowing skulls or not you'll be
196310	taken care of because it's RGB lit and
198410	you can turn it off so thanks once again
201049	to Intel for sponsoring this roundup be
203120	sure to check out our other videos from
