350	welcome to Linus tech tips make sure you
2700	guys subscribe for our I think awesome
4859	maybe you think it's awesome to daily
7200	tech videos today we're going to be
9000	checking out the ducky shine mini a 60%
12780	size keyboard with a whole lot more
15570	under the hood than initially meets the
17670	eye
24590	cooler master Neptune series CPU coolers
27599	are available in a variety of radiator
29400	sizes to perfectly suit your next build
31590	click now to learn more despite the as
35340	expected excellent build quality with
37469	you know it's a aluminum housing and
39390	stuff right off the bat there was some
41399	stuff I really didn't like about the
43230	shine mini some things are good you can
45420	use the function modifier to access your
48450	f keys volume control arrow keys print
51300	screen etc but it's tiny layout means
53670	that it has to make the best possible
56190	use of the keys that it has and I really
59039	felt like not having a function key on
60960	the left hand side requiring a function
64140	modifier to access escape and having
66780	Tildy as the main layer over there and
68549	the placement of the arrow keys in the
70979	second layer on the right directly above
73200	the lone function key so you can barely
74549	get both hands in there we're pretty
76200	serious since then I put on my actually
81900	doing reviews instead of just hating on
83790	things based on initial impressions hat
85500	and checked out the stuff that came in
88020	the box turns out you get a plastic dust
90030	cover you get a key cap remover you get
93750	a warranty card you get some replacement
96150	laser etched key caps and ah yes the
98700	manual turns out ducky thought of
100829	everything that I just bitched about you
103020	can use those replacement key caps and
105090	some really neat reconfigurability of
107490	the keyboard to change the escape key
109380	functionality add a contextual menu
111720	button swap the priority of delete and
114600	backspace add another function key
116670	wherever you want on the bottom row as
118409	long as you don't override both of your
120360	controls both of your alts etc and
123079	change the win at the Internet lock key
126149	to something a little more useful like
127829	function or control friggin awesome
130229	we're off to a good start here now the
132690	setup process for
133770	this is not as intuitive as I think
135870	ducky would like to think it is it
137880	definitely requires some trial and error
140040	the manual or the kind of intimacy with
143640	the functionality of your keyboard that
144900	only certain people will ever have but
146490	if you've got a reference in front of
148590	you it's pretty quick to set up and even
150990	then it's not the kind of thing that
151950	you'll need to do often anyway just hold
154170	function alt H to enter the ducky
157260	advisor setup mode and the appropriate
160170	keys will be eliminated Q quits the mode
162270	and if you press anything else it'll
164130	guide you through the reconfig process
165990	using illuminated numeric keys to change
168180	modes freakin awesome again and I
170880	haven't even touched on lighting yet
172410	it's a ducky shine so of course there
174210	are lights and this time it's not just
176130	single color lights we get dual LEDs in
179280	each key switch that can operate alone
181170	or blend it together for a pretty
183270	satisfying variety of colors you can
185550	change modes with function alt G from
188250	100% backlit with any blended color
190320	you'd like just adjust each led by
192840	holding Z or X to reactive typing with
195870	the same independent LED brightness
197370	controls too reactive mode with
199650	randomized colors actually really like
201570	this one too tripping balls mode also
204810	known as completely random effects on
206700	every key all the time
208080	two wave mode which is pretty
209760	self-explanatory two color cycling mode
211950	which just cycles through every
213240	available color to finally off mode
215370	which if you're using on a ducky shine
217230	is basically bad and you should feel bad
220260	one last landing mode is the custom mode
222840	which allows you to use the LED in the
224910	caps lock key to determine what color
227220	you're setting then assign individual
229380	colors per key you can save to
231810	user-defined schemes here that you can
233370	recall using functional V or B which
235800	leaves us with the final feature one
237660	that I intentionally glossed over at the
239550	beginning of this video and expected to
241260	give exactly zero cares about because
244050	when Nick told me about it I was like oh
246320	but actually it ended up being one of
248760	the my favorite features on this
250380	keyboard the mouse emulation key block
253170	hold function and use WASD to move the
256649	mouse cursor around you can also with
258269	nearby Keys press left and right click
260100	and you can actually swap those around
261298	with ducky advisor if you prefer you can
263250	even move the scroll wheel up and down
264570	the only unfortunate thing that's
266280	missing is
266920	you can't middle click the scroll wheel
268360	but the acceleration curves are well
271240	tuned and overall it works surprisingly
273460	well this whole review was done on my
276910	laptop without touching the trackpad or
279220	a mouse and without getting frustrated I
281530	used my keyboard for all my mouse
283210	movement now we just need a wireless one
285250	for immediate PC users so conclusion
288490	time then it's a ducky so that means you
290920	get all the things that go along with
292150	that there's stellar reputation for
294130	build quality genuine Cherry MX key
296500	switches no software required for
299110	configuration of any of its
300460	functionality which means everything it
302980	does works on any OS any time but that
306730	you can't really fine-tune things like
308440	if I wanted trip balls mode to leave off
311650	out of the randomize pattern for example
314370	but all that ducky goodness comes with
318250	one big caveat here you need to decide
320890	if a 60% is right for you you get the
324550	extra desk space especially on the right
326770	side where you move your mouse with the
328360	ergonomic benefits that are associated
329920	with having your arms closer together
331630	but you lose convenient access to a lot
334360	of keys on your keyboard that you might
336400	find yourself missing at least for a
338680	while while you're still getting used to
340180	it speaking of getting used to things
342580	deals aren't hard to get used to and boy
