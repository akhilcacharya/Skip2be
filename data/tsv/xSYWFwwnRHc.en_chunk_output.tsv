30	okay so we've got a new series of
1560	unboxing videos starting today unboxing
4529	at the camera man's desk so we have the
6810	SteelSeries for HD and we're gonna take
9900	this out of the box here so first break
11759	the seal here
12599	SteelSeries just launched this along
14460	with the 9 HD as well as their news eye
17369	and Kinzua mouse now
19140	SteelSeries sent me as i but it didn't
21330	have a retail block so I can't really do
22980	an unboxing but you can you can check
24930	out the mouse here before we open this
26640	mousepad there you go
28560	that is the Zeiss oh it's got one two
30240	three four buttons and this is to change
32040	the DPI you got your wheel and then left
34500	and right click that uses a laser grade
36960	gaming engine so that's means that has a
39840	laser sensor okay so let's get this
42300	mousepad open and if I could get it out
46140	of the box that would be tremendous
47730	there we go
48300	alright so it comes in a little
50899	clamshell package which we can unsecure
53910	from here oh oh that's kind of nice okay
56730	so this is like a semi semi hard surface
59789	so I can actually bend it a little bit
62219	here but not too much and then on the
64650	bottom which the cameraman was trying to
66210	show you before I moved it's kind of a
68030	bum poly rubber surface so if you put it
71280	down it actually won't move much like
74010	the other SteelSeries mouse pad you have
75990	in here which is the Wow mouse pad so
78240	you've got all your little SteelSeries
80130	logos and i guess we can actually play
81750	around with the tracking a little bit
82890	like right off the bat here tracking
85020	seems to be satisfactory on the on the
87630	mac we're using it on so it's hard to
89189	say cuz max up for gaming anyway anyway
92310	thank you for checking out my blog video
93900	on the SteelSeries
94920	for HD
