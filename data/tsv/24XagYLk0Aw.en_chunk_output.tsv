17190	world's first multimedia robot for your
20430	home you can control him with native
22470	voice commands that are processed
23970	locally or extend his capabilities with
26580	Google home or Alexa does any of that
29460	make sense it didn't to me at first so I
31289	had to seek Iker with my own eyes
33630	to understand keikar let's break it down
35850	into parts for audio you've got 4 10
39030	watt speakers and a 50 watt subwoofer
41460	that's more than most TVs come with by
43800	default so your audio listening
45690	experience for music or movies should
47309	actually be pretty good now for video
49680	there's a projector on sort of the front
51960	at 720p and it can rotate up to 90
55079	degrees vertical so you can watch movies
56910	directly on the wall in front of it or
58859	you can tilt it all the way up
60449	vertically onto the ceiling or anywhere
62190	in between then on the top it has a
64879	360-degree camera which you can use to
67830	interface with your kids or freak the
70860	ever living crap out of your pets or use
74040	as a security device or whatever else
76890	you could think of with a mobile
79130	360-degree camera and yes I did mean
82229	mobile keikar can move it has wheels on
85350	the bottom and while yeah it's gonna
87180	kind of suck at stairs it would be able
89189	to move around one floor of your house
91020	quite effectively and it will map out
93000	that floor of your house moving to its
94740	charging dock when it needs to and
96570	coming to you when you need it to so you
99630	just made a sandwich and you go into the
100920	living room and you want to watch a show
102000	for some reason kickers in the bedroom
104369	you're like hey keikar go to the living
107070	room play Netflix stranger things it'll
109860	come to the real living room it'll play
111509	Netflix for you on the wall because why
114149	not so if you're not currently watching
116310	Netflix which I know it sounds crazy but
118290	it is a possibility and you're not
120000	trying to harass your pet with this
121799	crazy robot that rolls around the ground
123930	and can you make light come from it you
126119	can do other things as well it has
127770	humidity and temperature detection and
129598	it also has movement detection and light
132200	detection so you can use it as a
133520	security device when you're away from
135050	the home but if you don't need your
136819	mobile temperature detecting humidity
139970	detecting intruder detecting light
142010	detecting robot to do anything other
143840	than just play different types of video
146599	in different rooms in your house well it
148730	has Android TV built-in as well so you
150709	can install whatever apps on it you want
152239	with keikar extending from Google home
154550	and Alexa much in the same way that
156110	something like Philips hue would you can
158120	send commands to it through those
160160	devices so like with Philips hue if you
162200	were like hey turn the lights down you
164150	could also do something like hey keikar
165830	what's the sponsor spot and keep you
168110	would be like oh yeah hey it's
169400	FreshBooks although i I don't I don't
171049	think that functionality is in that
172220	right now it might be in there later but
174200	with freshbooks you can do tons of stuff
176299	you can create invoices in 30 seconds or
178250	less which is awesome you can view if
181370	someone who's actually seen your invoice
182720	or not so they're not paying the invoice
184700	you can ask them why and make sure that
186860	they've actually seen the invoice maybe
188120	if they didn't see it you can resend it
189560	or something like that
190579	and you can even set up online payments
192590	so if they aren't able to pay you in
194209	person or if this is an online job or if
197090	it's really just easier for them to do
198739	it online because maybe they're paying
200359	later when you're not there you'd be
202579	able to handle all of that through fresh
204350	books so you can focus on being
205940	productive and actually growing your
207350	business instead of wasting time on a
