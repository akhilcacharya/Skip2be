199	okay so today we're gonna be unboxing a
2610	product that isn't really all that new
5009	but it has something new about it so you
8189	see this little sticker that they've put
10170	on the box here new bind all 15 buttons
13410	without leaving the game available off
15299	patch 3.2.2 or later so when this
18390	product was first released it wasn't
20730	actually fully compatible with the game
23039	now it is completely integrated to the
25769	game so that you can take any action
28260	that you can perform in the game and you
29580	can bind it directly to a button before
31890	it used to be that SteelSeries had it
34469	set up so that when you press the button
36329	it would execute a small macro so that
38969	meant that it would actually like kind
40559	of type a command in whereas now it's
43110	integrated directly into the world of
45149	warcraft game engine so that it's
47160	seamless okay so here we can see the
50460	mouse itself laid in with some gold and
53219	not oh no dragon jewels or whatever and
55199	then up here they show a quick preview
56910	of the interface for configuring the
59940	mouse itself now that would obviously be
61829	the old interface now that the mouse can
64229	be configured within the game okay so
66510	let's get this box open if I can figure
68369	out how to do it I think it opens down
70650	here yep there we go okay so we undo the
74159	the gold and then we have a small
76500	plastic sheath over the mouse itself now
79170	I do want to I can get the most to come
82200	out of there yeah there we go okay I
84720	want to have a look at the accessories
85920	that are included first though as per my
88140	usual thing so not a whole lot as you
91890	can see in terms of accessories it's
93450	pretty bare down there but what we do
95040	have is a World of Warcraft MMO gaming
97500	mouse Quick Start Guide so basically
100020	they tell you to go to SteelSeries comm
101759	/downloads get the latest drivers that's
103979	what i always recommend anyway I don't
105780	even like seeing a driver disk in the
108149	box because you shouldn't be using it
109590	they tell you how to configure the mouse
111270	they show you all the default
112680	assignments for the buttons auto run
114810	last hostile stop all nearest enemy all
117119	that kind of Wow terminology that I
120000	would know if I played that game which I
121770	don't
123200	all right so here we have a nice
126360	beautiful braided cord that's really
128460	nice so it won't won't get caught on
130560	stuff you can see it's quite shiny then
132450	it's a little bit slippery so that if
134010	you are tugging on it it will slip past
136290	whatever obstacles are in your way
138090	so let's have a quick look at the
139530	ergonomics of the WoW Mouse itself so
142260	you can see that it is a symmetrical
144810	Mouse so you can use it as either a
146910	lefty or a righty but on the one side
149430	you've got a layout that is obviously a
151620	little bit better suited for a thumb
153750	okay so you got your four buttons here
155250	and then this would be forward back for
156780	your browser or you can configure it to
158370	whatever you want in-game and then on
160200	the other side for your pinky is only
162540	two buttons
163500	okay so then on the top of the mouse you
165780	have another one two three four five six
168720	seven and one thing that's cool about
171150	the well Mouse is there's actually
172890	lighting in between these little sort of
175350	overlapping Armour bits here that you
178380	can configure to whatever color you want
180570	now this would it be a complete Wow
182820	Mouse unboxing without a quick look at
185459	it versus the Razer Naga MMO Mouse but
189360	actually one more thing before we stop
190980	is I wanted to have a look at the huge
193190	slippy pads on the bottom of this Mouse
195780	the slippy pads what am i calling them
197489	these are Teflon pads and that's going
200400	to enable you to have a really good
202019	gliding experience no matter what kind
204420	of surface you're using it on so here it
206040	is against the Naga which is kind of a
208440	similar sort of idea for a mouse it is
210480	an MMO gaming mouse but they do take
212700	slightly different approaches where the
214470	WoW Mouse integrates directly into the
216570	game in terms of assignment the Naga can
219300	only be assigned to the one two three
221750	the number keys across the top of the
224340	keyboard or the number pad so you have
226590	to press a little button and those are
228239	the only keys that can be bound to at
230190	this time they also take very different
232290	approaches in terms of the button
233970	layouts and the ergonomics so the
235680	SteelSeries mouse is for lefties or
238290	righties whereas the Naga would be
239910	extremely uncomfortable if you were to
241920	try to use it with a left head now the
243840	buttons are kind of accessible from all
245880	your different fingers on the MMO Mouse
248070	whereas on the Naga it's pretty much
250230	only your thumb which uses this number
252600	pad on the side
254130	and your index finger that's where
255900	you're going to be hitting most of the
257550	buttons on the mouse from so thank you
259380	for checking out my unboxing of the
261060	SteelSeries
261839	world of warcraft MMO gaming mouse
