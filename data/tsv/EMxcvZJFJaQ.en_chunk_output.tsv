30	this video is brought to you by the
1560	intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
5100	if you're a speed freak added until 3500
8010	series SSD to your Haswell system for a
10500	truly enthusiast class experience
12540	welcome to my unboxing of the flagship
15210	of flagships of corsair keyboards this
18869	is the Vengeance k95 which is a direct
21750	replacement for the k9t in terms of
24570	feature set and it brings some
26340	compelling new features with it that
29400	make it not just a slotted replacement
32279	but I'd say a significant improvement I
34290	mean I wouldn't have minded if they'd
36210	called it the K 100 but I guess that
39090	sort of breaks the you know K and 2
42510	digits after the numbering scheme that
44969	they were going for but the unfortunate
46559	thing about that for Corsairs they
48300	started at 90 they could have easily
49920	done a K 30 or you know like a you know
53039	20 to start with but they started right
54989	there at 90 so that left them not a
57090	whole lot of room to move on the
59219	numbering scheme so the first thing
61320	that's different about the K 95 versus
63539	the K 90 and this was complaint number
65970	uno for the K 90 was the fact that all
69810	the key switches on the K 95 are now
73350	mechanical on the k9b the macro keys as
76830	well as the F keys along the top of the
79860	keyboard removed rubber dome switches in
82530	addition so all these macro keys right
84479	here
85070	alright now let's move over all these
87180	macro keys here used rubber dome
88890	membrane key switches all these F keys
91200	at the top as well as escape used rubber
93030	domes and these guys right here youth
95009	rubber domes enthusiasts basically when
97140	it Corsair we think it's interesting
99860	your philosophy about how you want these
102600	ones to feel different tactile ease so
104820	that I can tell what I'm doing when I'm
106740	not looking at the keyboard but we don't
108630	care what we'd like you to do is replace
110820	them with mechanical keys Corsair took
112860	that feedback and implemented it with
115049	the K 95 it is fully mechanical the next
117719	thing that is different about the K 95
119969	versus the K 90 is that it is in a
123509	different color scheme so you can see
126899	that we've got that same blue aluminum
130199	backplane that gives the keyboard a very
133020	Premium look did I say blue aluminum
137370	okay we've got that same aluminum black
138840	backplane that gives the keyboard a very
140730	very clean look as well as extreme
143550	ruggedness so of course our keyboards
146160	have almost no flex you can see how
147810	thick that piece of aluminum is that
150180	makes up the unibody construction of it
152760	that goes all the way down to here we go
155490	all the way down to the bottom of the
157380	where the wrist rest attaches and then
159240	all the way up to the top it's very very
161070	rigid and another thing that courser
162510	does that's unique is they have an
164280	extremely high distance between the
166950	bottom of the key cap right here and the
170100	top of the backplane and what this does
172320	is it gives them a very strong underglow
174960	effect because these keys are
177990	individually backlit so these LEDs are
180510	casting light not only through the keys
182640	themselves and you can see there's
183990	varying brightness levels three
186240	brightness levels and as well as off but
188610	also down on the backplane itself that
190770	gives it a very very very very cool
192750	effect this is one of the things that I
194340	believe sold Corsair keyboards because
197700	it's a very unique look the next thing
200340	is the wrist rest has not been changed
203370	much from the previous gen I really like
205500	Corsairs implementation on the wrist
207150	rest here and that is it's different
209370	from the K 70 where they have done away
211260	with the metal screws here at the edges
213630	that make it extremely secure as well as
216570	I believe less prone to breakage the
218760	plastic the plastic clips on the K 70
221550	have a pretty strong design but there's
224130	no substitute for these metal thumb
226200	screws that are able to attach this in a
228840	much more more permanent fashion and
230640	even if these broke off which I don't
232620	think they would they could still be
233850	guides and you could still firmly secure
235710	it with this on the bottom of the
237270	keyboard
237690	you've got flip-out feet right here that
239760	are going to allow you to change the
241200	elevation slightly as well as rubber
242880	feet here here here and here that'll
245910	keep it from slipping around on the back
247770	of the keyboard we find a single USB
250170	pass-through so you can use this for
251580	your mouse or for I don't know a USB
254250	Drive or whatever else that you want as
255900	well as a bio switch this is kind of
258089	unique and the funny thing about the
259410	BIOS which is coarser makes no mention
262320	of it no mention here no mention on the
265890	web
266470	so I will explain what it does it
268300	enables better compatibility with
270790	different motherboards particularly ones
272500	running legacy biases this was one of
274300	the other complaints that I personally
275860	had about the k9t was that it wasn't
278170	always compatible with motherboards
280330	allowing you to get into the BIOS if you
282070	pressed to delete in time so they've got
283990	four different profiles here one two
285910	four and eight that will allow you to
288570	get into the BIOS appear of your
291070	motherboard pretty much regardless so
292600	that's a really strong thing another
294250	carry over from the k9t is the media
296830	Keys which I believe are some of the
298180	best out there so you've got stop back
300310	play pause and forward as well as mute
302500	and a volume wheel volume wheels are
304750	much more intuitive and natural for me
306400	to use than something like function of
308410	hotkey up on the F keys themselves so I
310720	love seeing them implemented that is
312580	that is my favorite way of doing that
314110	moving on down here we've got a Windows
317020	key lock that is also a carry over as
318940	well as the brightness adjustment that I
321790	showed you guys before I'm going to put
323170	it on the dimmest one to see you guys
324370	can see what I'm talking about here and
325660	check this out the keys are individually
328420	backlit they are also individually
330160	controllable here we go so you hold this
334060	button down and all of a sudden whoa
335950	what's going on only like a bunch of
338860	random keys over here on the keyboard a
340750	backlit you can change and backlight
343330	whichever keys you desire so if you
346660	wanted to oh yeah there you go so if you
350110	wanted to like spell your name across
351850	the keyboard you could blank out the
353800	whole thing oh oh I have not done this
356440	the most effective way but bear with me
359380	here guys so there you have it that is
361480	my feeble attempt to have the keyboard
364060	say my name on it instead of any kind of
366250	sort of reasonable patterns so there's
368410	an L I can
372919	ends tough u.s.c cool and that all you
377240	have to do is you press this down hold
379009	her down and you have effectively
381650	changed the mode so you can switch
383419	between the modes by pressing one of
386389	these buttons if I recall correctly
387590	there we go so by pressing this button
389749	you can go full backlit not backlit and
391669	then using brightness adjust you can
392930	turn the whole thing off entirely very
395389	cool stuff all of the G programmable G 1
398539	2 G 18 keys can be programmed on-the-fly
402020	you also have three different profile
404090	layers for each of them and that I think
406639	is pretty self-explanatory or you can
408590	use Corsairs gaming software in order to
411439	enable sort of a bunch of this
413270	functionality as well if you don't
415069	prefer to program things on the fly I
416719	think that pretty much wraps it up oh
418550	right
419000	uh-huh cherry MX red so the K 95 is
422180	still only available with cherry MX red
424460	switches because these are according to
426830	sort of what Corsair would believe
428900	although I'd um not necessarily myrrh so
431689	that's part of the problem but according
433939	to Corsair for gaming cherry MX Reds are
437150	still the most optimal key switches
438919	because of their extremely light tactile
441169	response so you they're very light
443539	button presses as well as their linear
445039	switch fashion allowing you to quickly
447199	and easily repeat the buttons in a way
449599	that you can't really do with the
451069	tactile switches like Cherry MX blues
453469	so while blues might be more satisfying
455210	for typing this is a gaming keyboard so
457729	Corsair is going well you know what
458899	we're going to deliver the best product
460189	that we think is most appropriate for
461659	gaming and the typists can get K 70s
464479	which are available with other key
466550	switches as well so this particular one
468589	cherry MX red and let's just see if I
471949	missed anything else guys don't forget
473960	to leave a comment under the video let
475460	me know what you think of the k95 let me
