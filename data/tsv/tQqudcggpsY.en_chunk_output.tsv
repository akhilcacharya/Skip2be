16470	only one person asked for this unboxing
18359	but I was going to do it anyway so there
19740	you go my unboxing of the Razer Tartarus
22800	game tag whatever you want to call these
25740	things basically Razer has taken the
29039	orb-weaver which is their mechanical
31170	gaming device there you go
33000	so it's kind of a keyboard replacement
36030	so you still use your mouse in your
37620	mouse hand and then you use this and
39420	what would typically be your keyboard
41129	hand but it is completely optimized for
44399	gaming this is now a membrane version so
47940	it is a lower-priced version of a very
51239	similar sort of concept as the
53460	orb-weaver so let's go ahead and open
55590	this bad boy up and have a look at what
58170	are the key differences so just like the
59879	orb-weaver it is backlit they have made
62640	some changes to the ergonomics and
64619	unlike the Nostromo which was an
67560	existing product okay they have made
70530	some new economic tweaks as well so the
74640	Tartarus is fully integrated with Razer
76979	synapse 2.0 software which means all of
79320	the 25 buttons on it are fully
82229	programmable I do think their marketing
84479	for this product is a touch deceptive on
86580	me to put it sort of completely honestly
89369	though because what Razer says is 25
91799	fully programmable keys and 8-way thumb
94140	pad the 8 way thumb pad is actually
95970	included in the 25 programmable keys so
99360	I'll show you where all of them are if
100740	you want guys want to check this out so
102360	there's 15 here just like that so here's
105390	where your WASD fingers would typically
107490	go you've got a nice convenient bump
109110	right there in the center so you can
110340	find your way back to it easily but
112049	backlight is implemented in a very
113850	different way compared to the orb-weaver
115799	where the each key is individually
118229	backlight so you can see there's quite a
119579	bit of spill through from the back which
121680	some people will find more attractive
123090	and others will find less attractive
125189	okay so there's your 15 keys then you've
128310	got eight more here so this is an you
132030	can probably actually hear those clicks
133349	that's an
133860	eight-way thumb sort of joystick button
136470	you've got an additional button here and
138450	an additional one here so that's 15 plus
140100	10 is 25 you can actually switch between
142950	eight different profiles on the fly and
145710	each of these buttons is completely
148080	customizable in remappable using synapse
150090	2.0 you just have to set it up one time
151830	then you can use it online or offline
153450	whichever you prefer you can have an
155610	unlimited number of game profiles and
157470	you can have unlimited length macros
159810	which i find to be a very very
162180	attractive feature now unlike the orb
164100	weaver the Tartarus doesn't feature
165780	quite the same degree of customizability
167880	so pretty much all you can do is take
169980	the wrist rest and move it up and down
172380	like this so there's a little key right
174030	here that allows you to go ahead and
175770	move that back and forth on the orb
177630	weaver we saw a bit of a higher end
179670	implementation of this functionality
181170	where there's a metal skeleton on the
183450	bottom of it and then you can actually
184830	move here you go
186360	the thumb piece out here you could move
188459	the bottom piece out and backwards and
191580	then you could let's see if I can get
193980	that yeah there you go
194670	so you can move this piece and you could
196080	actually unlock this rest right here
198000	which had a nice rubberized grip to it
200220	much the same as the Death Adder 2013
202230	edition this one uses more of a soft
204480	touch feel overall and is quite a bit
206640	lighter as well but one thing that I
208260	liked that raised is improved over the
209850	orb-weaver is it has a gorgeous braided
211980	cord that just feels more durable and
213989	this might seem like a trivial thing to
216180	you but if you have cats braided cables
218459	are a godsend I have had cables that
221430	were on the brink of destruction and if
223140	it wasn't for the braiding they wouldn't
224760	have made it
226290	now razors branding for this is infinite
229050	possibilities and I see where they're
230550	coming from because in addition to the
232230	unlimited profiles and the 15 buttons
234570	over here you can actually use the 8 way
236400	pad over here as a modifier now I
239700	personally would probably still end up
241410	using WASD as opposed to this 8 Way pad
244050	even though I understand why people
246420	might want to use this for movement then
247709	they have access to more spells or
249150	macros or whatever else so you can kind
250980	of use it however you want but this is
252930	very appealing to me using this as a
254280	modifier for what you're doing so if you
256620	use this as WASD then you could actually
258779	map eight different functions to the 10
260880	key here for example by holding it this
262919	way and pressing it this way and
264210	pressing it this way etc etc and so on
266400	this makes this not only
267730	useful from a gaming standpoint but I've
269380	also you heard of even creative
271330	professionals using these kinds of
273220	devices as a as a quick hotkey device
276370	that actually sits next to their
277570	keyboard and you can use in things like
278860	Photoshop for example it works on
280900	Windows or Mac so whichever you prefer
283030	is just fine by Razer and in terms of
286240	ergonomics I'd say if you have smaller
288580	hands you're going to find the Tartarus
290740	more comfortable by default than the
292990	orb-weaver even at the orb-weaver
294670	smallest setting so I'm going to go
296500	ahead and adjust this one back down I
298240	did find it to be a little bit on the
300430	big side for me so you can see that
302620	because it has a larger key matrix
304320	actually I'll put the Tartarus in front
306670	so it has a larger key matrix there just
309400	wasn't much that I could reach with my
311710	smaller hands and it expands very nicely
314110	for people with large hands so go with
316180	the Tartarus with its MX blue sargo with
318130	the orb-weaver with its MX blue switches
319750	if you have larger hands or if you
322000	prefer mechanical switches which many
324160	many gamers do or if you want something
326320	that uses membrane caps so you can hear
329430	much quieter very different tactile
336160	experience or if you have smaller hands
338230	or or whatever else the case may be
339940	razors got a couple of different options
341320	for you thank you for checking out my
343060	unboxing an overview of the Tartarus
344830	from Razer don't forget to subscribe
346330	don't forget to like this video if you
347980	liked it dislike it if you disliked it
349780	and leave a comment letting me know what
351310	do you think of these would you rather
353680	just use your keyboard
354910	I mean Corsair tried to implement
356530	something with the Vengeance k60 where
358780	they added like a little addition to the
360760	keyboard that was like a little wrist
361960	rest thing but I don't think anyone ever
363220	actually ended up using it because I
364600	think everyone who cared about that was
366010	already using something like this so so
367780	what do you prefer I actually don't
369370	think I ever mentioned the large rubber
371140	grippy pads on the bottom those are
373270	excellent I don't know if they had yeah
375490	very similar to the ones on the
376660	orb-weaver actually
