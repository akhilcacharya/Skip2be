7120	today I have the CM storm spawn to unbox
11110	this is arming the gaming revolution is
13420	a 3500 dpi precision optical gaming
16540	mouse with onboard Sentinel X at 32
18520	kilobyte so that is memory onboard with
21099	a claw style ergonomic design superior
22960	rubberized anti-slip grip design which
25000	is good for our claw grip and let's see
27039	what else they have to say for
27880	themselves so you can adjust it between
29350	eight hundred eighteen hundred and
30460	thirty five hundred dpi it takes sixty
32558	images per second it supports up to 20
35590	G's of acceleration okay what else
39070	maximum 1000 Hertz which is the max USB
42220	transfer rate okay seven programmable of
44649	seven fully programmable buttons very
46390	nice Omron five million click micro
49030	switches it's just with Teflon feet a
52030	two meter gold plated USB cable let's
55000	see what else they got to say for
56050	themselves in here right security and
57820	control fascinating ok ante drift
61420	control so what's that mean what's ante
63700	drift
64769	well the spawn game you must utilize is
67180	a high-performance optical engine
68410	insures extreme stability but with an
70030	anti drift architecture provides
71319	lossless performance under mouse lift
73420	and drop with a built in angle snapping
75009	option one can formulate the perfect
76420	flick shot and maximize their kill rates
78100	highly adaptive under all speeds this
79810	one endures all tactical movements ok
83470	let's open this baby up nope give me a
87130	sec here guys and let's take out the
92349	mouse itself so the first thing I notice
95289	about this particular Mouse is that it
97149	is in economic style Mouse so what that
100479	means is that it will only really fit in
105759	the right hand if you try to use this
107500	with your left hand it is not going to
109599	work very well at all because the
113500	positioning will be all wrong however if
116289	you use it in your right hand this is
118030	going to fit like a glove you can see
120970	actually I would say right off the bat
123280	that this would be best for someone with
125410	smaller hands like myself because you
127300	can see that fits very comfortably
128340	whereas if I had larger hands I don't
130690	know that it would work quite as well
131770	mind you if you're using a fingertip
134080	grip or a claw style grip then a smaller
137170	mouse can be preferred especially if you
139060	have these rubber
139770	scripts on the side which allow you to
141690	manipulate the mouse even if you are not
144690	palming it like someone like me would
146550	however if you do have a small hand you
148200	will be able to film this Mouse quite
149850	comfortably so let's show you guys the
151680	positioning of the buttons so here there
154350	are no buttons here there's a nice
155820	contour for your ring finger here you've
158280	got your right click your left click
160080	your middle click your scroll wheel your
162990	dpi up and down
164760	you've got your forward and back buttons
166800	here on the side and another rubberized
169080	grip here the overall look at the mouse
171180	is very very sharp this is a nice
172860	metallic red I hope you can make out the
174960	the finish of that color right there it
177180	looks really really good
178170	and then on the bottom you can see here
180030	we've got the 3500 dpi
182250	storm tactical sensor here as well as a
185730	Teflon foot at the top and a Teflon foot
188220	at the bottom the mouse cord itself is
190830	not braided but it is a very flexible
195240	feeling cord so it shouldn't get in your
197220	way when you're gaming and you've got a
199320	gold plated USB connector right here
201810	including gold-plated contacts on the
204420	inside so that should ensure that you
206070	don't lose your connection very easily
207980	and that it doesn't wear out as easily
210540	as mice without gold plated connectors
213230	so thank you for checking out my
215220	unboxing of these storm tactics CM storm
