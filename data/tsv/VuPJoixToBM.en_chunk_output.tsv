0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to
2490	you by the AKG K 7 XX available from
5100	mass drop find them at the link in the
7170	video description so we are at one of
10230	the trickiest booths here at the show
12960	behind me is what is called a hyper
16109	vision display wall or something like
19140	that it's freaking cool the brand that
21930	makes it is hyper vision and it is
23840	unlike anything else I've ever seen now
26910	to be clear like 10 years ago I had a
29910	case fan for my computer that had LEDs
32790	on it that you could program to put some
34920	text in this is like that and it's been
38489	at the gym for the last 10 years and
40620	it's been roided-up as all hell so each
43469	one of these spinning displays has four
46379	blades with over 200 micro LEDs per
50340	blade that gives you an effective 4k
53719	resolution per fan so you can upload a
57239	3d movie or 3d animated video to create
61620	a pseudo 3d image and the crazy thing
64559	about it is because it is lifted off of
67229	the background it's got this like pseudo
70200	3d effect that even like looks
72840	three-dimensional when you look at it
74400	from the side I asked them how it works
76619	and they basically went secret sauce
79409	it's amazing so each one of these fans
82380	has internal processing we got them to
85110	admit that there's some kind of CPU
86850	memory and storage for content but they
90119	wouldn't give us any real details about
92340	how that works it'll cost you a whopping
95670	three thousand two hundred and forty
98460	dollars per fan though so this is mostly
100500	intended for commercial applications but
103350	let's say you kind of go well gee Linus
105750	I got a lot more than that to spend and
107970	I want more than one fan so the video
109799	walls behind me they're just launching
112229	these at the show here well you can rent
114090	the small one for 30 grand and the big
116369	one for 50 in the future they do plan to
119700	offer these to things like our retail
122159	spaces for demonstrations but there's no
125009	word yet on avail
126500	or pricing now in terms of the content
129288	that can be displayed on these they have
131120	a strict certification process for
133340	Studios that are authorized to create
136070	content for them because they're very
137870	protective of how good the content looks
140510	and I can imagine why because everything
142640	they're showing here looks absolutely
144850	mind-blowing so the way that you get
147800	content to it is it's all cloud managed
150290	so each one of these has a Wi-Fi or
152600	Ethernet connection to pull down the
154160	video that it needs so you can use any
156410	3d animation software like Maya or
159230	cinema 4d to create massive animations
162440	like this and thanks to the way that the
164660	fan blades are actually slightly offset
167510	on the walls the appearance is nearly
171130	seamless it's making it seamless here's
174800	my transition to our sponsor spot the
177050	AKG K 7 xx from mass drop features an
180230	open back design memory foam ear pads
182090	and the leather headband it's a great
184700	sounding headphone at a great price and
186890	for 200 bucks you can get it delivered
188989	to you at the link in the video
190910	description so thanks for watching guys
193489	you can dislike or you can like you can
195760	check out where to buy one of these at
198140	the link in the video description if you
199580	are so inclined and I will see you guys
