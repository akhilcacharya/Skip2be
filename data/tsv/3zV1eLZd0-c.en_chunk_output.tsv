30	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2460	the rocket rocket rocket rocket that's
5670	the way to say it rocket rocket is
7589	school FX so this is a premium level
10980	gaming keyboard and before we get too
13620	far into this know it isn't mechanical
15750	but it does have a lot of features that
18000	do set it apart from other keyboards
20160	even at this price range so the MSRP is
22590	something like ninety nine euros but
24930	it's really the software that sets this
27810	guy apart as well as some of the design
30029	things that they've integrated that
31380	really do make it a tool for enhancing
33719	your gaming experience whether it's to
36600	make you better or whether it's just to
38460	make it more enjoyable and so we'll get
40890	into some of those in a bit more detail
42329	once we get it opened up so first
44460	there's a quick installation guide
45860	important document you know what we're
48180	not going to worry too much about that
49110	download the latest drivers off the
50969	rocket website and that was pretty much
53910	it so packaging is very minimalistic on
56340	this guy there we are and let's start
60359	going through some of the features once
62579	we get this covering sort of torn off
66420	there we go there we go alright so
73490	relatively low profile keys so you can
76380	see the key caps don't stand up very
78390	high so it's not quite like a like a
80700	laptop keyboard but it is there the idea
83070	is responsiveness so it features a
84810	thousand Hertz polling rate so there
86880	should be pretty much no leg and then
88530	the idea with the low profile keys is
90180	that you should be able to actuate them
92280	more quickly this is especially
93420	important for membrane key switches
95759	because you do have to bottom them out
97290	in order to activate them I'm actually
99000	going to pull this up as a cheat sheet
100560	because there's a lot of stuff to cover
103110	all right programmable keys so you've
106979	actually got a zone here and I'm going
108990	to use this to illustrate it right here
111180	of 20 keys that can have macro
114899	functionality programmed into them and
117140	simply by using the rocket shift plus so
120719	you have a regular shift key and then
122430	you have another sort of see you can see
124740	it's got like a weird sort of graphic on
126540	it with like a downward shift and a plus
128369	so that's the shift plus so when you're
130470	gaming you put your hand there and then
133240	all of these keys over here in this zone
135400	that you can reach with your hand can be
137080	programmed to have macro functionality
138850	this to me is a way better solution than
141970	having something like a programmable key
144760	that's off to the side I mean we've seen
146740	ones with banks of programmable keys
148540	that are this big how you going to reach
150190	and you don't take your hand off the
151480	keyboard to go like fumble if a macro
154240	doesn't work that way so the shift is a
156460	great addition not only that but with
158920	rocket talks if you have a rocket Mouse
160690	as well
161380	you can press shift on your mouse and
163600	then activate a macro key on the
166930	keyboard or you can press shift on the
169180	keyboard and change the functionality of
171100	any of the keys on the mouse so the way
172960	that they work together is very very
175060	very cool you've also got some fully
177070	programmable keys so these can have a
178900	basic function programmed and then a
181180	shift plus functionality programmed into
184120	them so either those can be macros a
185440	regular functionality and they've added
187480	three thumb buttons here that they're
189220	calling like quick strike buttons or
190750	something along those lines of the idea
192070	is that they're things that you could
193510	reach with your thumb
194680	rather than spacebar and there's a
196450	little indent here so you can tell which
198130	one you're actually touching so that's
199960	very very cool stuff they've actually
201010	also added an indent on the W key itself
204250	so it's your regular home row one's your
206590	W and then this thumb one here as well
209320	as the five over on the number pad the
211150	layout is very standard so they haven't
213190	committed any cardinal sins the caps
215470	lock key looks like it's been replaced
217390	I'm not sure if they have a software
218860	functionality to turn that back on it's
220630	probably not the end of the world since
221920	most gamers should have their caps lock
223840	keys taken away anyway long enter
227050	backspace and shift keys so nothing
229150	nothing wrong with the layout whatsoever
231130	quick macro recording so on-the-fly you
233020	can record macros and use them this is
234820	kind of neat this is something we have
236080	seen before
236740	there are also media keys up here at the
238930	top and pretty soon it's going to be
241210	time to start talking about some of the
242890	other software functionality which I've
244420	kind of forgotten about ah yes so Rocket
246640	FX is pretty neat so you can actually
249310	tell the keyboard you want it to have
250990	certain effects when certain things
253090	happen so if you get hit for example the
255490	keyboard could glow red it has a fully
258450	adjustable color so something sixteen
261100	point eight million colors so you can
263260	light it up in whatever color you want
265140	180 plus programmable
267190	functions and the Mac for live recording
269020	okay twenty five-plus functions
270100	assignable to media plus hotkeys okay
272590	yeah we got all that got all that six
274420	brightness levels out has anti-ghosting
276040	so you don't have to worry about
277660	so what ghosting is is if you press a
279880	bunch of keys then it can just register
281590	random extra keystrokes so it does have
284170	anti-ghosting thousand Hertz pulling
286030	rate we've covered already the rocket
287470	talk set bonus is neat so the cone pier
290500	and the cone at shoot xtd are the ones
296080	that actually support that functionality
297880	with the keyboard ah we'll be back in a
303670	moment so you can have a number of
305530	different game profiles and that can be
307240	indicated by the profile selector button
309460	up here so that'll shift to a bunch of
310900	different macros and all that kind of
312220	cool stuff the wrist rest is actually I
314230	think one of the stronger points of this
315640	keyboard not necessarily because it's
317740	like through super heavy-duty or
319930	anything like that but it's quite long
322120	so it actually gives you somewhere to
324220	rest your wrist unlike a lot of the
325600	gaming keyboards we've seen in the past
326980	that are kind of like this where you
327940	fall off them especially if you have
329380	longer hands so it's a very natural it's
332169	a very natural shape to put your entire
333790	palm down which is technically bad
336130	keyboarding form but let's face it a lot
338680	of people do it so it is what it is
341350	you've got cable management holes on the
343630	bottom here so you can route your mouse
345130	cable or sort of any other necessary
346480	cables around you've also got a nice
348790	rubber on the bottom all over the place
351400	the entire under the wrist rest is here
354310	here here and here and then up on the
355930	top of the keyboard there here here and
357340	here and then these unfortunately do not
359919	have do they okay I can't quite tell
363490	that looks like it yeah these have the
365710	same rubber pads on them as well so
367450	that's actually quite nice to see
369040	because sometimes you put those feet up
370690	and they don't have rubber on them so
372310	they can actually move around yeah the
373600	whole keyboards not going anywhere once
375280	we get it set up so I think that pretty
376930	much covers it for now thank you for
378790	checking out this unboxing and first
380080	look at the sqf x from rocket don't
382450	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
383860	for more unboxings reviews and other
385030	computer videos actually it occurs to me
388330	now we should have done a nice shot of
391240	this guy so you can see we've got it on
393220	a cycling effect where it's changing the
396580	colors or it's breathing or it's doing
398350	something I don't know there's a bunch
399310	of different functionality
400310	that you can access just by pressing
402380	that there we go so there's some
404390	different brightness levels it's kind of
406460	neat the way they've done the
407300	illumination so the keys actually don't
409760	even look like like they're clear like
413150	they're see-through for the for the
415490	buttons themselves you can see them
416990	quite clearly in the light but then they
418730	do illuminate once the keyboard is once
421430	the light gets a little bit darker in
423080	the room so now we're actually done
