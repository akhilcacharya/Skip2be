7919	card and USB reader for your mobile
9630	devices check the link in the video
11280	description to learn more about the a
12809	data - drive air AE 400 welcome to my
15509	unboxing of the prime edition keyboard
17430	from tte sports so this guy right here
19890	is marine King Prime and he had a lot to
23010	do with the design of this keyboard it's
24630	very different from the regular
25890	thermaltake mecha g1 still has 50
28560	million keystroke longevity but you'll
30300	get that from pretty much any Cherry MX
31619	key switch keyboard it has custom picked
34140	key caps as well as Cherry MX brown
36870	switches so that is where the
38370	differences really come in they've got a
40440	spiel from him on here there we go
42660	so marine King they've actually got that
45329	spelled wrong hopefully he doesn't get
46950	bothered too much by that in games like
48480	Starcraft 2 the speed at which you can
49770	queue up commands another typo that's
51870	okay is and build an army while
54030	simultaneously attacking and defending
55260	means that you too can be king of the
56730	Marines basically you can read the whole
58050	thing if you want to pause the video and
59789	read it so the mecha g1 is a very
62250	well-built mechanical keyboard we
64860	already have one of them here in the
66270	office and this one shares many of the
68189	same characteristics there's your
69479	warranty card right there as well as a
72930	wrist rest it's got a nice nice glossy
76020	red finish on it right there including
78240	the 1000 Hertz polling rate so this
80640	could theoretically result in a slightly
83880	lower latency when inputting command so
86970	whether or not you'd notice the
88170	difference between you know say 500
90119	Hertz and 1000 Hertz is up to the
92490	individual user but I think many would
94619	notice the difference between a typical
96829	125 Hertz keyboard and a thousand Hertz
100079	keyboard in terms of the input response
102150	time so here we find what is unique
105000	about it so we still got the media keys
106829	however the Escape key has been replaced
109350	with a prime team logo right there it
113549	has an outlandish black white pink and
119119	red color scheme so to go along with the
122820	sort of flamboyant attire that marine
125700	came typically sports and we've got here
129598	we go I guess that's pretty much it it's
132090	a mecha g1 except it look
133800	really cool and right of course
135590	hopefully it comes with a key puller oh
137940	here's one never know when you'll need a
140430	key puller when you're about to do it
141660	unboxing so you want to handy at all
143010	times ah yes so a man after my own heart
145950	marine King Prime prefers Cherry MX
148020	brown switches so Cherry MX brown
149850	switches are a tactile switch but much
152610	quieter than cherry MX blues Cherry MX
155580	blue is have that really sort of well
158910	deafening click it's very very loud
161520	whereas a brown sounds closer to
165750	something more like a black but you
167580	still have that definite actuation point
171420	feeling where you you can really feel
174090	the key switch and get being actuated
179030	moving on it has a built-in USB 2.0 port
182550	as well as pastors for microphone and
184560	headphone as well as what they're saying
187170	is I think they call it like a
188550	military-grade ruggedized cable and it
190980	actually does happen to be phenomenally
193020	rugged so thank you for checking out my
