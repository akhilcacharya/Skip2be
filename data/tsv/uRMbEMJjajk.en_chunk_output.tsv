30	this video is brought to you by our
1890	trusted graphics partner Nvidia hahaha
10370	this is the razer naga hex lola ditto
14340	weight league of legends hold on that's
16020	different
16470	oh yeah it came not a laughing thing ok
20369	so this is the razer naga expert mobile
23699	which i actually had to look up i
25500	haven't heard of that before so it's
26760	apparently something something something
29220	can't remember multiplayer online battle
31109	arena that's a genre now I mean I always
33780	thought we just called it dota and
35040	League of Legends because those are sort
36630	of the primary games but there you go
38160	optimised for mobile and action RPG
41309	games or I mean MMO probably is just as
44969	valid for something like this because
47600	however unlike the regular Naga which
51300	has 12 buttons on the side the Naga hex
54390	is named such because it only has six
56760	buttons on the side so it's not quite as
59120	as crazy optimized for tons and tons and
63270	tons of different functionality but more
64830	like you want to have a bunch of
66540	different profiles with a few different
70939	commands that you'd want to be able to
72780	execute at a moment's notice now if you
75659	followed - tech tips you probably
77369	already know that I do like the Naga the
80100	original one I've never tried the hex
81930	although based on what I'm seeing so far
84090	they're going to be pretty similar and I
86850	do like the idea of mice that have a lot
89310	of buttons on the side the G 600 was
91950	probably the biggest disappointment for
93960	me out of the lot just because and again
96630	if you've watched Linus tech tips videos
98250	for a while you'll have you'll know this
99630	already but because I found the I found
102600	the tracking to feel sort of a little
105390	bit laggy there's some some latency
107610	there that was bothering me whereas the
109799	Naga I have never had that problem so
112590	it's I mean you can see that it's one of
114869	the ones that's actually on our gaming
116909	test bench so we do actually use it it's
119570	you can always tell when we pull
121979	something out and it's sort of nearby
123689	and convenient that it's something that
125040	we like and actually use day-to-day so
126750	there you go so let's have a look at
128580	what Razer includes dominate the fields
130949	of justice with the Naga hex
132650	cool okay so there's a little card there
134269	there's some good at packaging giving
135470	you a little like things that are sort
137450	of neat changing the rubber thumb rest
139730	okay so there's a thumb rest in the
141500	middle which you can apparently adjust
143390	to different side grips right there so
145819	you've got a larger one and a smaller
147470	one and then it looks like the medium
149299	one comes equipped on the mouse and this
150739	is smart actually for a reason that I'll
152599	explain in a moment we've got some Razer
154879	stickers which are obviously pretty
156799	sweet as well as the rest of their usual
158930	documentation ah yes you get a free
160909	Champion with the mouse and since I
162950	don't need a League of Legends champion
164239	I would be happy to give them to you
166340	guys so you get a free Tryndamere yay
169700	first one to reclaim the code gets it
172660	there you go
174049	enjoy free giveaway for you guys there
176060	all right so what's good about the Naga
177950	hex first of all it has the same shape
180049	as the original Naga which I like it's
182150	perfect for sort of smaller and smallish
185780	medium hands to be very nicely contoured
188690	so you can see from both angles here
190609	there's somewhere to rest your pinky
192079	somewhere to rest your ring finger
193819	places for your middle and index fingers
195920	and of course somewhere to put your
197480	thumb I find for myself personally this
200000	is the best
200930	ergonomic Razer Mouse that I have used
203840	and I've used pretty much all of them I
205849	also really like this this improvement
208190	on the hex here versus the original Naga
210349	so people complain with the original
211940	Naga that you would often accidentally
213859	hit these buttons when you're trying to
215660	lift the mouse off the surface I
217040	personally never had that issue with it
218930	but some people did so what they've done
220609	is they've added this thumb rest right
223040	in the middle of your six buttons here
224780	number one is that depending on what
227150	size you use you can optimize it so that
229220	you can easily feel your way around
230599	these buttons and number two is that
233480	also gives you a complete a convenient
235340	place to hold the mouse should you want
238160	to easily lift off the table so without
240019	using these two fingers at all I can
241970	take the mouse I can go like hold on
243799	there we go yeah I can go like this
245180	without actuated any of those side
247459	buttons I can move quite vigorously so
249650	this is extremely handy now in terms of
252109	mappings similar to the original Naga it
255169	looks like they've changed the pad on
257478	the bottom so the original Naga had a
259099	ring shaped pad around the entire Mouse
260930	whereas the hex version has got smaller
264380	pad feet that are here
265949	these approaches look pretty similar to
267990	me because the surface area see it's
269430	quite thin around the edges here looks
270960	pretty similar they're going to take a
272159	long way to wear down either way but
274020	their selections here so you can either
275310	use the number pad to to bind to these
278009	keys automatically or you can use the
280469	number keys across the top of the
282509	keyboard they both also include more
285030	support right around the sensor itself
287250	it is a laser mouse there you go so
289379	there's that one on that one in right in
291030	the middle of the mouse so it glides
292139	extremely smoothly now in terms of
294150	buttons on this guy right here there's
295650	the six on the side so these are
297569	mechanical buttons it's got a very
301379	satisfying click to them whereas the
303180	original Naga didn't really have that
305610	click it was a very very different feel
307770	that are actually rated for up to 250
312990	clicks per minute which i think is
315750	actually pretty interesting that's an
318060	awful lot of clicks especially given
319949	that you'd never click one of the
322319	individual buttons 250 times a minute
324449	unless it's about 5 times a second on
327509	one button so it's pretty much optimized
330629	for the most demanding workloads I think
332849	as far as that goes
333960	it does include support for synapse 2.0
336270	now synapse originally there were a lot
339449	of complaints about it but Razer really
341279	addressed them with one of the most
342690	recent updates so it's their cloud-based
344219	software that allows you to essentially
346770	store your profiles for your peripheral
348870	and take them with you because anytime
350639	you're connected to the Internet you log
352529	in to your profile and it'll go boom
354210	you're using your Razer peripherals ok
356159	these are all the settings that you like
357449	to use so it's just a cloud-based thing
359099	but originally if you didn't log in you
362370	wouldn't be able to even use the
363569	profiles on a peripheral that you'd
365310	already plugged in so they've completely
367139	fixed that now so it works even in
369029	offline mode and it'll give you the most
370830	up-to-date ones if you are not an
372599	offline mode going back to the most
374550	they've relocated two of the other
375930	buttons as well so by default these are
377879	your back and forward buttons on the
379199	original Naga
380039	whereas now instead of having two
381779	buttons up here what I actually found
383159	were quite difficult to reach
384569	particularly this one anyway they
386580	relocated them here and more like the
388440	traditional dpi sensor switching
391050	location that people are more used to
393210	seeing whereas this is a bit of a
394800	there's not that many mice that use this
397080	particular configuration
398520	did I mention over
399810	has a 5600 DPI sensor I hope I did in
402900	terms of the rest of the looks there
404250	hasn't really been that much that's
405720	changed so instead of an illuminated
407700	Razer logo here there's an illuminated
409470	League of Legends logo which goes along
411210	with the co-branding of the mouse as
413280	well as instead of a blue illuminated
416160	scroll wheel they've gone with a yellow
418110	one instead so we're going to go ahead
419669	and plug this in so you guys can get a
421260	good idea of what the mouse looks like
422850	once it lights up and we're going to
424740	finish up with a quick unboxing of the
432930	accompanying League of Legends Goliath
435600	is mousepad so there you go it has some
437970	League of Legends artwork on it it's
439800	also got sort of the usual things you've
442080	come to expect from any Goliath as'
443729	mousepad so it has an anti fray edge so
446310	it's not going too well fray although in
449340	my experience usually even the ones that
451440	go straight to the edge with the regular
452940	Mouse we've usually take two to three
455340	years to start fraying it's got a nice
456990	rubber bottom on it so I mean what is
459360	there to say about it it has League of
460680	Legends graphics on it it goes with your
462210	mouse and it's made by Razer so it's
463470	probably fine it has a pretty tight
465690	weave so it's a fairly smooth surface
468630	for a clock pad so personally I do
471570	prefer a bit of a less dense weave but
474390	that comes down to the individual users
476160	choice and I think that pretty much
478890	wraps it up now it's come to my
480300	attention that you guys guys may not
482370	have seen the game code the first time
483810	around so I'm just going to flash that
485010	one more time and best of luck to
487350	whoever gets the barbarian there thank
490410	you for checking out oh yeah I think
492150	they're rated for yet 10 million click
494430	lifecycle for the for the buttons on the
496620	mouse and I think that's everything that
498870	I wanted to say about it thanks for
500910	checking out this unboxing don't forget
502800	to subscribe to - tech tips for more
504060	unboxings reviews and other computer
506460	videos and know there was more thing I
508050	wanted to say there's 24 click spots
510030	Razer for whatever reason calls that out
514010	24 we can count them together if you'd
516929	like or we could just end the video now
518610	make sure you subscribe
