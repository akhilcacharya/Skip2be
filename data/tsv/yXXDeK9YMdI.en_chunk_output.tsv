960	[Music]
7040	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9510	the meta dot Das Keyboard professional s
12090	so the dust keyboard professional s
14280	first we'll start with what meta dog has
15900	to say about the Das Keyboard
17850	mechanical Cui's the key suit key
19650	switches for maximum speed and comfort
21630	this much is true
22920	it also has full and key rollover thus
25289	avoiding key jamming which is a big
27240	problem especially with very fast
29730	typists so yes you will be more
31949	comfortable yes you will be faster
33630	everyone you put a mechanical keyboard
35070	in front of even if it's not ideal for
36750	them will type faster in double-digit
39629	percentages more often than not
41360	high-speed USB 2.0 hub extra long cable
44579	and requires some kind of computer as
47190	far as I can tell all Microsoft Mac and
50190	Linux operating systems I mean I guess
53160	if you like were running Android on your
59940	desktop maybe it won't work but it
61920	probably will
62719	so moving right along it comes with a
64949	little cleaning cloth which is good
66210	because the desk keyboard has a bit of a
67860	glossy finish to it go ahead and move
70890	this out of here and pull this sunny
73140	here it also comes with a little
74250	installation guide which basically means
76979	plug the thing into the thing there is
79080	no driver required for the dots keyboard
82369	now meta dot has four different variants
86729	available okay there is an ultimate s
90740	for alt R sorry there's an ultimate
93119	silent and there's an ultimate clicky
94829	and then there's a professional silent
96930	and a professional clicky
98220	so we went with the professional silent
100439	and the ultimate clicky for what's
101939	upcoming on the NCIX
103950	tech tips channel where we're going to
105329	do a thank you we're going to do a
108479	mechanical keyboard roundup because that
111149	gives us a good representation of
112680	everything available for meta dot the
114990	ultimate versus professional moniker
117479	means that it either has em sorry I'm
121409	just going to pull off a key can't hear
122579	it either has printing on the top of the
125189	keys or they're all completely blank and
127380	then the silent versus clicky means that
130348	it either is using quieter key so it
133590	or ones with more of a distinct click so
136800	we're going to talk a lot about
137940	different key switches as well in that
140730	upcoming episode of NCI expect if so you
142950	can clearly see here that the desk
144900	keyboard silent version uses Cherry MX
147390	brown switches and the brown refers not
149790	only to the color of the switch but also
152069	to the characteristics of it so the
153660	characteristics of this switch are that
155340	it has a bit of a smoother travel and a
158910	much quieter travel compared to the ones
161790	that are used in the clicky version now
163260	that doesn't mean that it's necessarily
165030	silent a mechanical keyboard is almost
168269	always going to be louder than a
169830	membrane keyboard and this is partly
171599	just due to the quality of the
172799	construction because if you come right
175620	down on it you'll bottom it out and
177269	they're generally built out of much more
178739	solid materials than well your standard
181440	cheapo keyboard and quite frankly from a
184160	typists perspective as well as from a
186810	gamers perspective I don't see a good
188640	reason why you wouldn't use a mechanical
190769	keyboard with so many options available
192569	on the market on the back of the
194700	keyboard you see we've got little feet
195959	for inclining it slightly should you see
198510	fit it also has four rubber pads that
201630	keep it in place
203359	so it doesn't go anywhere when you put
206069	it down which is good because keyboards
208799	that run away are bad okay in terms of
211410	layout everything is fairly bog-standard
213060	on this guy long strips enter and
215160	backspace and a completely standard
217530	layout for the rest of the keyboard so
219030	what it comes down to is the build
221100	quality of it nice long cables included
223799	so we're going to just open that up
224970	there you go it's approximately 1.15
230280	Linus arm spans which makes it about I
233010	guess 7 feet ok also comes with 2 USB
236430	ports at the end of it so one of these
237930	is for the hub which is sorry here and
242120	the other one is for the actual keyboard
246299	itself so you can see there clearly
248430	labeled keyboard and hub which is very
252239	helpful so if you put this here it won't
253680	do anything useful comes with a ps2
255690	adapter just in case you do want to use
257279	your keyboard with ps2 and I think that
259589	pretty much covers it so remember guys
261269	you can get the Das Keyboard in four
264060	different varieties and get it click
265540	on clicky and you can get it with
267100	printing on the keycaps or completely
270160	blank if you're one of those elitists
271930	who doesn't want people to be able to
273010	sit down and use your computer which I
274990	mean I can't say there's anyone in this
276370	room like that but thank you for
279010	watching Linus tech tips don't forget to
