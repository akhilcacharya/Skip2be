30	synergy to from seamless makes it easier
2550	than ever to share a single keyboard and
4200	mouse with multiple computers you can
6330	check it out at the link in the video
8099	description so we're here in the Intel
11160	booth at CES 2018 where they are showing
13320	off some very non-conventional chips so
18240	first up we've got a quantum processor
22470	from Intel this is codename tangle Lake
26580	the most advanced chip that has ever
29519	been designed if the folks here to be
31439	believed and I don't know they seem
33480	pretty credible so Intel is saying that
36180	this gate based chip has a provable
39230	quantum speed-up something that you
41520	actually can't take for granted because
43620	there has been some controversy in the
45750	quantum computing community around
47850	whether some existing quantum chips are
50670	actually faster or truly quantum so
55350	these connections you see here are
57059	actually fundamentally basic coaxial
60660	connections except they're made out of
62670	solid gold and this is where quantum
65970	computing gets kind of crazy
67770	they are basically externally driven by
70860	microwave generators that control and
74060	manipulate the qubits
76259	so the actual quantum processor though
79259	is on the other side and looks a little
81180	something like this guys so this has to
83640	be held at a temperature that is 250
86610	times colder than beep space so the only
90240	way to get it to that temperature is in
92579	a cooler about the size of a 55-gallon
95040	drum and then they're using some
97590	undisclosed helium isotope in order to
100770	chill it to that temperature now the
103170	practical applications of quantum
104759	computing are many so let's talk about
108409	Biosciences being able to simulate
110759	protein folding instead of serially bit
114420	by bit you can actually look at the
116310	whole thing all at once fluid dynamics
119280	computational science here's something
121920	they're talking about once they get to a
123689	hundred qubits they figure you'll be
125250	able to
125820	break through brute force alone existing
129270	encryption schemes so that's sort of
132360	terrifying but I've been assured that
133860	we'll have better encryption by the time
135840	that's a problem right right yeah good
138090	okay so that's great
140150	next to it we've got there neuromorphic
144150	Loihi chip so this is actually this
146850	little tiny chip right here under the
148800	board is a hundred and twenty eight
151230	cores of which only three of them I
153750	believe our conventional CPUs the rest
156780	of them are other types of processors so
159510	four of these guys fit on this board
161730	right here and they're using a type of
164070	architecture that is referred to as
166250	biomimetics
167370	or bio mimicking so it actually uses the
170040	same influencing and learning engines as
173040	the human brain so the advantage here is
176840	very very high speeds for the type of
180600	thinking that a brain would do so
182900	self-driving cars anybody and extreme
186390	power efficiency so they figure this is
188430	about a hundred times more efficient
190799	than a traditional chip for optimized
194010	workloads speaking of optimizing your
197010	workload synergy to makes it easier than
199200	ever to set up keyboard and mouse
200880	sharing between multiple computers
202769	please
203519	across even complicated networking
205440	setups and the best part is you guys can
208140	save fifty percent at the link below
210239	that is seamless comm slash synergy
212579	slash Linus CES 3 so thanks for watching
215489	guys you just like this video then you
217440	clearly like don't get excited about
219690	tech because this is cool if you
221700	guys liked it though hit like get
223019	subscribed so you don't miss any of our
224549	CES 2018 content and you'll see you at
226769	the next booth
