30	so today I'll be unboxing a product that
2310	while I didn't buy it I actually bought
6029	one about six months ago for my parents
8220	and the reason I bought it is because
11070	it's kind of a unique product so this is
13469	the logitech cordless media board pro
15480	for playstation 3 although you are not
18000	actually limited to using it with the
20580	playstation 3 they're actually using it
22859	for their media center PC and I'll
24810	explain how they're doing that in a
26070	minute but why don't we go through what
27689	Logitech says about it on the box first
29460	of all they say it is a keyboard second
31619	of all they say it is with Bluetooth
33059	wireless technology so it does use a
36149	Bluetooth interface there are no cords
38340	you just put in a battery and off you go
40379	cordless media keys and it has a
42450	touchpad and scroll bar so you can see
44640	right here that it actually has a mouse
46379	or like a touchpad built in to the
48989	keyboard it's slim okay and then we go
52260	around to the back and we find that it
54690	works up to 30 feet from your
56190	PlayStation 3 it has an integrated
57600	touchpad offers an easy way to enter
59280	text and type messages on the
60629	PlayStation 3 or a computer mm-hmm is
63600	perfect for the PlayStation Network it
65549	is lightweight perfect for living room
66930	use and it has quick media keys give
68939	instant access to media control panel
70680	movie menus and more so I will be
74850	opening the seals with my ruler knife
77820	which actually belongs to the cameraman
80100	not to me at all but I was like oh I
82590	have no knife but the difference is that
85049	I thought of it before we started
87150	filming today so the cameraman gave me
88920	something to use okay so inside we will
91560	find a blank white area surrounded by
96150	black and green when we remove that we
100560	will find a keyboard okay so it's held
102840	in by a couple pieces of foam right here
104579	so you can see it's actually quite well
106560	secured even without the top half of the
109079	box on it you can just go ahead and pull
112140	this out and let's see what we've got in
113790	terms of manuals and accessories like no
116820	accessories just a manual so let's open
119430	this up but a part number sticker on it
124020	okay that's helpful okay important
127020	information let's start with this it's
129000	in Portuguese and French
131390	and English yes English so duration of
134630	implied warranties national statutory
136940	rights the logitech address battery
139490	warning follow the batteries
141020	instructions as well as these important
142760	safety tips
143510	okay so mostly safety so safety is
145700	important Thank You Logitech next we
147830	have the installation manual for the
149690	cordless media board Pro and I have to
151490	confess I did end up needing this when I
153500	installed this for my parents so you put
157160	in the batteries that's pretty
158540	straightforward you turn the keyboard on
160310	by sliding the on/off switch that is not
162560	the step that I got stuck on I was not
165350	stuck on that step then you adjust the
167900	keyboard feet for comfort if required
169670	also not where I got stuck mm-hmm next
174380	you use the media keys and then you or
178459	whatever come on where's the step that I
180200	got stuck on oh yeah very very right
182540	right here okay so how you actually
184760	register the keyboard with your with
187010	your bluetooth adapter when pairing so
189500	you actually need to enter what they
192470	don't actually say maybe they've changed
194090	the procedure but I had to enter a
195709	password in order to get it to sync with
198140	the bluetooth dongle that was connected
200299	to the computer so that's the part that
202040	I found challenging because this
204500	keyboard was actually the first time I
206840	had ever used bluetooth for anything I'm
210890	not a phone guy and I tend to stick with
213350	wired for all of my peripherals so
215329	that's that's what I was using okay so
217489	the media board Pro it's a very
219620	comfortable keyboard actually you can
221420	easily sit and I'm gonna get the camera
223310	and to move for a little bit but you can
225530	easily sit on the couch and hold it in
227510	your lap it's very very comfortable in
229280	this kind of a position because it's so
230900	lightweight and so thin so you just kind
233450	of hold it where you're sitting wherever
235700	you happen to be sitting and then here
237769	look here so in terms of media keys you
240320	got a menu key back play forward and
242870	blu-ray DVD menu these all work on PC
246200	but I'm not sure what this one does in
248090	that context Logitech put a very glossy
250609	finish on this particular keyboard it
252950	does make it a bit of a fingerprint
254390	magnet but it's not the worst I've seen
256279	by a longshot
257660	keyboard is very as I said comfortable
260238	and the layout is very very standard so
262910	you have a full-size backspace
264320	shift-enter and other shift they haven't
266840	done anything particularly stupid but
268880	one thing that you might notice is that
272270	there's no windows key so these are
274520	actually right and left click so you can
277220	use you have a couple of different
278690	options you can either use the keyboard
280820	like this backup cameraman so with your
283430	right finger on the touchpad and these
285200	are your right and left click over here
286370	or you can use it like you would use a
288320	laptop with your left finger on the
289700	touchpad or vice versa and you can use
291950	the right and left click over here
293360	power button switch rather is over here
295820	so just slide that into the position
297980	that you require it to be in and then on
301010	the bottom you will find the structural
303560	bracing and this also allows it to be a
305420	little bit lighter because they haven't
306770	just filled the whole thing in with
307910	plastic and then the battery slots here
311330	are the little adjustable feet that the
313190	I assure you this is not the part that I
314810	got stuck on when I was installing this
316310	and then so the thing that is missing if
319970	you're using this with a computer is a
321560	bluetooth dongle because it's designed
323450	for the PlayStation 3 which has built-in
325160	bluetooth it does not include one so
327830	that means that you'll need to buy them
329060	and you can get them first cheapest like
330410	five ten bucks
331220	so just grab any bluetooth dongle
333320	generic one and then you can actually
335240	pair it to the keyboard it takes
336710	probably about five minutes so thank you
339050	for checking out my unboxing on the
340430	cordless media board pro
