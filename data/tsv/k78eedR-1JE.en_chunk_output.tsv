890	[Music]
7420	now our split fish product manager came
11360	to me and he asked me if I wanted to
12860	unbox this well it's a gaming peripheral
15830	it comes with a Chuck and I said what do
17840	you mean a Chuck what's a Chuck I
19420	thought I figured out what he meant he
22310	means it comes with like a nunchuck like
24380	device so this is the frag effects shark
29300	from split fish and what's cool about
31699	this particular gaming peripheral is
34460	that it is designed for ps3 pc and mac
38950	well that's not that special okay let's
41930	get into what's actually special about
43579	it this is a mouse and sort of like a
48170	mouse and chuck so it's a mouse and
51550	control pad style controller that works
55699	with the PlayStation 3 so here let's
58519	have a look at the mouse first so you
61070	can see the mouse includes your ps3
62750	compatible buttons it also has start a
65890	mouse wheel and clicks so that's kind of
69050	cool right because you know not everyone
70940	not everyone appreciates the analog
74060	stick for aiming in FPS games am i right
76960	I'm right okay it also includes a soft
81590	cloth mousepad that's got a couple of
84770	nuns some well ground not a couple it's
86360	got six non-slip rubber feet on the
88400	bottom okay so it comes with that so you
91159	can throw that on your lap and it
92659	includes a chuck so the chuck allows you
96439	to use macros rapid fire button
99770	remapping slick swap what's a stout
102890	stick swap there you go so you can swap
104600	sticks you've also got the ability to
106700	control the sensitivity you've got an
108259	on/off switch this as a ton of
109670	functionality you've got an analog stick
112490	okay and then you have three trigger
114649	buttons now it's
116950	the size is not that I was going to say
119350	it looks like it might be a little bit
120490	big for me but I can actually fairly
122110	comfortably reach everything but this
123670	button right here so I can reach all
125079	these guys no problem I can control the
127329	analog stick and I can control this no
128800	problem the mouse as well is attached on
132489	the big side but remember I do have very
134050	small hands but even so I'm able to
136660	comfortably reach all four of these
137920	buttons I can left or right click and I
140650	can sort of reach the start button I
142510	mean you don't you start button that
143620	much anymore console for anything like
145180	how they used to work when I played
147069	console games which was last console I
150970	owned when it was current was actually a
152590	Super Nintendo so it shows you it's been
155200	a while all right
156160	package includes a wireless mouse
157540	wireless left hand grip the Frank Chuck
159910	a dongle a mousepad I'll show you the
162280	dongle in a minute and a manual one of
164650	the most easy to use and intuitive
166090	controllers ever designed specifically
168730	for the ps3 and really they're focused
170769	on ps3 here PC and Mac the Frank effect
173260	shark gives you that same PC style
175000	gameplay on the ps3 faster more accurate
177970	and easy to use than a standard ps3
179680	controller yeah amen to that
181150	you can dynamically program the motion
183639	swap buttons use rapid fire and adjust
186069	the dead zone oh that's cool okay making
188560	the frag effects shark a truly
190000	intelligent controller requires two
191620	double-a batteries and with 50 hours of
194170	play time and 500 hours of power safe
196480	standby the mouse is a 1750 dpi sorry
199660	I'm just going through specs here but
200980	this is all relatively important you can
202989	play it with the mouse on the ps3 as you
205359	would do on a PC cool sixaxis support
211030	okay
211660	neat fast access to special theatres
213609	okay this is all kind of rehashing the
215079	same stuff now manual the manual is in a
218049	variety of different languages um
222810	including English which is good because
225130	that's what I can use where's the
227650	English one there we go oh it's a
229060	one-page manual so that's pretty
230500	straightforward so it shows you how to
231970	use it on the PC and the Mac should be
234430	fairly straightforward to set up on the
235750	ps3 so to start playing on the ps3 you
237880	press select and you're ready to go and
239590	play really that easy okay and it shows
241569	you how to program special functions as
243099	well so that's cool here is the dongle
245620	this is a wireless controller
249250	I can switch between controller and
252700	keyboard okay neato
256540	and here's how you would use it so
258850	you're sitting on your couch

269890	in all the noobs
