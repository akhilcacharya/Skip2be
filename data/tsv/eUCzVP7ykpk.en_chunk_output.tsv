0	why always with the expensive keyboards
3090	huh what does a $200 keyboard do then a
7350	$20 one won't well I decided to find out
11490	I ordered every backlit keyboard on
13920	amazon.com under $25 to see who makes
18600	the one that's worth your money will it
21330	be
21689	Shenzhen good source technology co
24060	limited as the O Corp or one by one well
28349	there's only one way to find out well
31140	two ways if you count just scrolling
33329	down to the Amazon links in the video
34829	description
42840	I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
47460	gaming laptops feature Intel seventh
49740	generation core i7 processors check them
52560	out at the link below
54410	first up is the DB power DB a8 a $25
59310	product whose information I can no
61350	longer find since the page has been
63570	removed from Amazon since I ordered it
65670	it's just as well I guess since this one
68610	kind of sucks it features a tricolor
71280	backlight with red blue or purple colors
73620	available but the membrane key switches
76050	are very mushy and there's too much flex
79020	in the deck for a comfortable gaming
81180	experience
82160	next is the CE shaun87 keys fashion
87150	classic the marketing material suggests
90150	that it might give you a great shock but
93210	based on what I saw of the build quality
95100	that seems very unlikely this thing is a
98700	tank for a $23 keyboard you get cable
102420	management holes on the bottom and
104509	function media keys along the top the
107670	key switches are among the best rubber
109770	domes that I felt for typing though I
112440	wish they'd included a wrist rest
114179	instead of this random mouse pad and the
116910	stems are cherry NX compatible so the
119729	cats can be easily replaced but I don't
122190	think you'd ever need to their premium
124500	double shot injection key caps you'd
127110	wear through your fingers first the keys
129840	are individually lit and while the
131880	colors can't be adjusted the animations
134430	can giving the fashion classic a
137069	charming retro look the gaming
139980	experience was not great however due to
142560	the very long key travel and the narrow
145290	Enter key is a bit of a bummer the N ped
148740	case 70 turned out to be the Moto speed
152550	K 70 L when it actually arrived so I
155970	ended up with two of the same thing good
158730	thing it was only 20 bucks the static
161250	rainbow backlight was a bit of a
163350	disappointment as were the horrible
165810	painted key caps that actually have
168569	overspray between them but at 20 bucks
172080	the K 70 L offers up a middle of the
175200	pack
175790	being experienced and one of the best
177829	gaming experiences in spite of its much
180620	higher than average deck flex the lack
182989	of media keys and the narrow Enter key
185420	heard it though so even with the drain
187819	holes for water resistance I'd go with
190549	something else the TK red from tech
193819	Republic is a little on the heavier side
196220	which gives it a higher-quality feel
199159	along with its media keys and other
201829	function shortcuts but beyond my initial
204620	impressions it flexes a lot has a very
208700	basic backlight setup with only on and
211189	off and most importantly has very mushy
215599	feeling keys that were unsatisfying for
218389	both typing and gaming not to mention
220970	that the price went up to over $30.00
223730	since I bought it fail II the L 70 from
228230	a Zeo is one of the more basic keyboards
230629	in our roundup the backlight is not
232760	exceptionally bright and just turns on
235489	and off there are no media keys other
237769	than a large volume knob and it doesn't
240109	boast a waterproof design or any other
242569	gimmick but it does include a large
245150	comfortable wrist rest the key switches
247370	feel pretty darn good for a $24 membrane
250459	keyboard and the coating on the key caps
252919	held up significantly better to my nice
255739	tip test then some of the other
257599	keyboards I tested so your mileage may
259880	vary the top negative review on Amazon
261649	complains about them flaking after four
263810	months the backspace also isn't
266479	especially well stabilized but overall
268699	the typing experience is the best out of
271310	the bunch and quite quiet though for
274340	gaming I found the slow rebound time of
276710	the long travel rubber domes to be
278720	detrimental for anything more fast-paced
280729	than very casual play the award for the
284300	worst instruction goes to the one by one
286940	I managed to figure out how to cycle the
289669	colors on my own but I stumbled on
292190	trying to figure out what the hell the
294680	function key is for turns out that the F
297949	Keys have secondary functions that
300740	aren't labeled and many of which are
302720	replicated with Hardware buttons in the
304669	row above but after some trial and error
306800	I unlocked its backlight animation and
309620	brightness controls too bad I couldn't
312290	unlock anything else that's exceptional
314330	about this keyboard the dedicated media
316400	keys are nice but the short backspace is
319790	enough to kill any positivity I might
322130	have felt towards the decent typing and
324470	gaming experience with the annoyingly
327199	loud shift keys being the final nail in
330440	the coffin there's not a lot to say
334340	about the large print tricolor keyboard
336830	from a zo
337850	that isn't in its name the typing
340490	experience is pretty bad out of the box
342470	because the spacebar is kind of hard to
344840	hit but it becomes serviceable with a
348020	wrist rest and the gaming experience is
350210	straight-up bad but this is one of the
352460	few backlit keyboards that doesn't try
355100	to be for gaming nope this one is for
358280	nan and the whole pitch is that the
360500	printing on the key caps is super easy
362750	to read mission accomplished then I
365120	suppose so if that's what you're after
367070	then go ham highly recommended the red
370970	dragon K 503 harp has got to be the best
374780	gaming experience so far and it's pretty
378169	good for typing except that the spacebar
380960	has got to be the softest
382700	Bunji at least tactile thing ever but
386599	the rebound speed on all key presses is
388760	pretty strong and it's got a lot of
390889	other great features as well including
392870	seven different colors for the
394490	backlighting media keys and dedicated
398330	function keys including search browser
401300	forward and back and refresh for some
404630	reason overall construction is
407270	middle-of-the-road
408020	but it seems like they're at least aware
409789	of the issue and they made a plan I mean
412849	sure the key cap paint is likely to wear
415220	off but you can just swap your wasds for
418340	the arrow keys no big deal LOL this
421789	keyboard the superbee peg 7 immutable
425060	felt a little like a bad tinder date in
427820	person it looks nowhere near as good as
430460	the picture it gets some points for
433099	function keys backlight brightness
434810	control and swappable WASD and
437810	arrow keys to run the on screen printing
439700	wears off but it should be noted that
441680	since the keys
443160	to use dye sublimation printing light
445710	doesn't shine through the lettering
447510	meaning you can't really see it that
449370	well in the dark gaming responsiveness
452160	is pretty solid but the typing
454530	experience especially the spacebar is
457200	very mushy and unsatisfying overall not
460530	recommended the narrow enter is just
462600	adding insult to injury finally our last
466460	contestant the maseo's LED gaming
470430	keyboard I don't know if any keyboard
473370	can be as good as this ones product page
476250	says it is but overall impressions are
479280	not too bad the Enter key is narrow
482610	which is a drag but it's got a lot of
485370	other stuff going for it seven different
487320	colors of backlight breathing effects
489480	for the lighting high-quality double
491910	shot keycaps the second best wrist rest
494940	in the roundup and an above average
496740	typing and gaming experience leaving us
500880	to the awards top style points go to the
503880	C shaun87 Keys fashion classic this
506970	thing has so much swagger for 25 bucks
510720	love it the best typing experience goes
514140	to the as vo levitron l 70 with its
516510	great wrist rest and solid overall build
519030	quality than for gaming I've got to give
521940	it to the red dragon K 503 harp lots of
525360	colors good responsiveness and solid
527940	typing - you can't go wrong with any of
530460	those three and the massey ohm or the
532740	1x1 are good options to everything else
