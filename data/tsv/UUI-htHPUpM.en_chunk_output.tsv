7510	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
10850	the much-awaited
13629	finally mechanical keyboard from
16369	Logitech in the G series this is the g7
19340	10 plus it uses Cherry MX brown switches
22300	which are a balance between sort of a
27680	tactile feel and quiet which is a factor
32180	for your more mainstream customer so the
34880	g7 10 plus is almost that that balanced
39080	approach between what the keyboard
41150	enthusiasts like which tends to be your
43220	cherry MX blues and what the sort of
46520	more mainstream customer would want
47870	which is a keyboard that doesn't make a
49700	whole lot of noise in fact I have a new
51110	co-worker who was looking at the Cherry
53390	MX blue keyboard in my office and he was
55940	like oh yeah it's the stupidest thing
57290	I've ever seen it's so loud can't Kevin
58940	can't get me can't can't can't get it
60050	it's stupid I'm like well no it's a
62450	typing experience and he's like nah
64909	that's the dumbest thing I ever heard
66200	so going with something like MX browns
68390	may be a very good approach although
70759	we'll have to try it to find out for
72560	sure
73120	110 key anti-ghosting which means no
75740	matter what
76850	typing combinations you hit you're not
79010	going to have any random keystrokes pop
80870	up 26 key rollover which means you can
83390	put both hands and your face all over
85010	the keyboard it's going to register
86450	every stroke game slash desktop mode so
89420	that's probably basically just turning
91370	off the windows button
93020	you know likelihood dedicated media
94880	controls this is the kind of thing that
96409	a lot of mechanical keyboards don't have
99470	because they tend to be very basic
100670	designs whereas a logitech I'm expecting
103100	all the bells and whistles adjustable
105440	dual zone backlighting so there's the
107479	rest of the keyboard and then there's
109040	just the WASD Keys six programmable G
112070	keys with 18 total functions you have
113810	three memory keys for switching between
115850	different profiles high speed low noise
118400	tactile switches for feedback you can
120680	feel which is exactly what I spent the
122810	first part of the video saying I am like
126320	super super excited about this because
128330	if there's anyone who knows how to build
130509	input devices it is Logitech and if
134540	there's anyone who likes mechanical key
136999	switches it is slick followed by me
140690	I like them but not quite as much as he
142880	does I mean he's like like he's like
145640	sitting over there and I can see the
147380	drool coming out of the side of his
148880	mouth just looking at this keyboard
150500	because he is he walked in today and he
153770	saw the keyboard ready to be unboxed and
155900	he was like oh yeah you know yeah I'm
158060	not that excited about it cuz you know
160040	cherry brown switches and he's a cherry
162710	blue guy and then after like five
165410	minutes of we're talking about
166670	completely other unrelated things he
169040	just kind of turns to me he's like yeah
170720	I know I'm really excited about this
172100	keyboard you have to hurry up and unbox
173780	it yeah he was trying to talk himself
177830	out of it cuz he knows he can't afford
179120	it right now he's still in school just
180830	like diesel the intern which is why it's
183350	hard for me to get any videos done
184910	because these guys schedules are
186500	absolutely terrible and they're
188300	impossible to work with both of them I
190220	should just fire them both no yeah I
194690	know right
195380	alright so like most logitech keyboards
199880	you actually get accessories included
201800	with it like your wrist rest whereas
203810	most of the sort of booty key brand
207320	mechanical keyboard guys don't include
209420	any extraneous stuff like wrist rests or
212150	keyboard backlights or you know fancy
214400	looking cables and all that kind of kind
216590	of jazz so we've got two USB plugs here
220100	one is for the keyboard itself and one
222410	is for a probably a pass through USB
224630	yeah so that pass through is up here at
227090	the top so you plug that into your mouse
228500	or you could not plug it into your mouse
230150	and you could just use it for like a USB
231860	key or whatever else because it'll be
234050	running at full USB 2 speed because it's
236300	just a pass-through and it's not an
237650	actual hub look at all the cable
240680	management options they've built into
242300	this so you could have a wire running
245270	for your headset under here through here
248570	through here and then run that down to
251000	the back of your computer like that so
252440	it actually comes out at sort of a
254080	sensible location instead of just
256640	draping over your keyboard that's
258079	awesome and all of the huge rubber
262029	non-slip pads on the bottom of this
264560	keyboard these are very well-built these
266030	are very high quality rubber you know
269660	guaranteed they won't break and cause
271700	problems like your
274040	we're moving around also you've got feet
276200	right here which do not have rubber pads
278300	on them unfortunately i've seen ones in
279920	the past that do but these ones don't
281660	however it should still not go anywhere
284240	because of the rubber pads here and here
287300	that are still going to be down on the
288620	table so you can either incline the
290240	keyboard or you cannot if you prefer
292310	more flat typing experience there's some
294230	flex here in the wrist rest so you don't
296390	have to worry too much about which way
298940	it's oriented or how flat the surface
300620	you have it on is all right ah you got
303770	your programmable G keys oh you know
306950	what I've never actually typed on browns
308450	before they're quiet but they do have
314980	more feedback than blacks I'll give them
318200	that not nearly as much as blues I think
320900	I have a blue keyboard right here yeah
322750	here's a blue Philco right here so for
325640	comparison here's the sound this is what
327890	I was talking about we're logitech's
329180	probably going for like a compromise
334330	between that kind of a click and that
338600	kind of a sound so membrane keys are
341000	pretty much always quiet but then also
342590	just loops okay well we'll put that away
344390	for now they also just feel so mushy and
347540	you don't have that that response
349310	whereas these ones you can feel after
351980	here you got to get in really close for
353450	this so you push it down a little bit
355400	and the key hasn't registered yet and
357440	right there you can you can feel the
360620	mechanical switch there's a there's a
363200	pressure point there so you don't
365030	actually have to bottom them out and
367100	mash them in order to type on on Browns
369860	you can press them quite softly and
371420	you'll still have a good typing
372410	experience but it's not loud and I'd
377240	have to I'd have to sit and I'd have to
378770	actually use it for a long time to know
380150	for sure what I think but let's go ahead
382040	and plug it into something so we can
383210	have a look at the backlight now there's
386270	not many keyboards that I'd be
387530	considering proper gaming mechanical
390590	keyboards but the Corsair k9t as well as
394190	the g7 10 plus would be the ones that
395960	I'd say are more applicable now k9t uses
400190	red switches red switches are very
401810	linear so you know that sort of that
403370	buckling point that I showed you on the
405350	Logitech one that doesn't exist on
407510	them on the Corsairs you don't actually
408950	see where the key depress happens some
411260	people find this less helpful for typing
413930	whereas on Browns you really do have a
416480	little bit more feedback coming into
418070	your hands on sort of what you're
419990	actually typing neither of them are as
422470	responsive again as blues which I showed
424670	you before but there aren't any sort of
427010	fully featured keyboards like this where
429320	you've got things like macro keys and a
431900	full software suite that goes with it
433760	that are mechanical keyboards so this is
437300	what we've got to work with okay
439570	advantages g7 ten plus number one is
442460	these buttons and these buttons are all
444950	mechanical on the Corsair keyboard
446900	whoopsie daisies on the Corsair keyboard
451100	the programmable keys and the F keys as
453620	well as these keys are not mechanical
455990	okay another kind of cool thing about
458150	the Logitech keyboard is the course r1
460970	has three brightness levels one two
462980	three and it does get pretty bright
464630	the Logitech one looks like it has two
467990	three four four brightness levels okay
471740	white backlight so it's up to you if you
473750	prefer white or blue personally I prefer
475160	blue you can switch between different
477650	profiles for the G keys here so you can
479270	program three full sets of functions I
481010	personally don't see much value to
482870	having this many programmable keys on
484640	the left of the keyboard because I'm not
485930	going to be able to reach them in the
487010	heat of battle anyway this is probably a
488930	good balance okay here you can control
492560	the brightness of either just the wasds
498160	or just the rest of the keyboard using
501740	two dedicated buttons up here you've got
503570	built-in media control keys on both of
505670	them built-in volume key knobs on both
509270	of them those are both working just fine
511520	mute button mute button so they're very
513679	similar in terms of their features it
516440	just comes down to what's the overall
518900	build quality that's actually very good
521539	Wow
522140	that's comparable to to something like a
524540	Philco or a ducky there's no flex to
526520	this thing at all that's outstanding
527690	although it doesn't have a metal
529640	backplane the same way that the k9t does
531800	so the k9d does have a little bit less
533600	flex on the backplane but the overall
536900	construction of this feels very good
538760	like not quite I don't think we
540440	kill a man with it but pretty darn
542360	pretty darn close aesthetics of it are
544970	great I think the orange accent here is
546800	outstanding I wouldn't mind if this
548750	instead of being a glossy black was sort
551120	of a less glossy black however it
553640	doesn't seem to be too much of a grease
555650	or dust magnet so far just kind of sort
558740	of pick at it a little bit see how gross
560810	it gets and it looks like it cleans off
562400	pretty easily there's a lot more to
564380	glossy finishes than just glossy or not
566300	glossy and this appears to be a very
568220	high quality one I think that pretty
570680	much covers everything that I can say
572450	about the g7 10 plus so Amanda gist for
574880	Logitech are going to be the cherry
576260	brown switches are going to be their
578450	very mature software platform that they
581150	have for their gaming peripherals as
583250	well as the fact that when it comes to
585080	true gaming keyboards fully featured
586580	gaming keyboards out there there's not a
588140	whole lot of choice for mechanical and
589790	if I was going to pick one I would
591260	definitely go with cherry Browns /
592820	cherry Reds thanks for checking out this
