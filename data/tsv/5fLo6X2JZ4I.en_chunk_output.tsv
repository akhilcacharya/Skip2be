890	[Music]
7070	I am now on the list for Microsoft
10070	hardware apparently so all I got in
13220	terms of information about this
14780	particular guy here is that this is
17090	model number one for 8 - of a keyboard
20539	made by Microsoft ok this is the 3x J 0
24590	0 0 1 9 in terms of the part number and
27230	it comes in a brown box this is a
30800	Microsoft keyboard which has a bit of a
32630	wave to it go ahead and take the plastic
37070	covering off here and hopefully at some
38780	point you'll be able to find out exactly
41510	what this model is oh here we go so
44539	apparently what I have to unbox and take
47030	a look at today is the Microsoft Comfort
49010	Curve keyboard 3000 for business so that
52309	is what ms part number x8 2 2 1 3 4 - 0
56120	0 5 is look at that the manufacturing
58399	gate is like less than a month ago very
61460	cool
62030	alright so let's have a look at this
64040	your product and see if Microsoft
65750	includes anything else of note in the
68120	packaging so we do have a product guide
69860	with important safety and health
71060	information as well as a limited
72380	warranty terms of warranty I wouldn't
74780	worry too much all ok keyboarding oh
76340	three years neat ok and the thing about
81259	Microsoft hardware warranty is that it
83329	is actually one of the best in the biz
85090	they are there are very very very many
90159	testimonials out there on the interwebs
92890	about how Microsoft takes care of their
95659	Hardware customers when something goes
97490	wrong with a Microsoft keyboard mouse
99320	headset joystick whatever the case may
101390	be so let's have a look at the layout
103130	overall I was actually one of the shoot
106729	what was that thing called I think it
108950	was called the Microsoft natural
110570	keyboard that that old old one that was
113329	made of like you know beige old computer
115460	colored plastic and had the split in the
117530	middle right so you're using it you're
118700	like this clickety clickety clickety
121090	everyone hated it when it first came out
124009	um
124820	I blow everyone ideal I mean there are
126560	lots of people who swear by those those
128889	economic style keyboards but I loved it
131600	I had one of those original Microsoft
133160	ones that I used for years and this is
137010	or like an in-between so you don't have
138959	that split down the middle of the
140760	keyboard but you can see if you look at
142890	it in an angle it does have a bit of a
144510	curve so why did I like it so much I
146849	liked it because this when you're when
149670	you're resting your arms this shape I'm
152129	going to point them at you is a lot more
153870	natural than this in terms of your
156180	shoulders and the alignment of your arms
157890	so they put a slight curve to this
159599	keyboard so that you're actually holding
161459	your hands in a more comfortable
163049	position while you type while keeping
167760	the keys altogether so you don't have
169620	that weird on natural split because
170879	remember not everyone types correctly
172739	although using that keyboard was one of
174569	the ways that fixed my incorrect typing
176549	where I was reaching over to the other
178200	side of the keyboard whatever it was
179609	convenient because the split didn't
181109	allow me to do it so this guy right here
183540	it just has a slight curve so it's an in
185159	between a flat keyboard and a larger
188989	Guignard that's whatever I was trying to
191220	go with that now in terms of the layout
192900	we've got a pretty standard layout
194430	Microsoft hasn't committed any cardinal
196709	sins on this keyboard so you can see we
198480	have a full-size tab very long Shift key
201269	in order to make sure that you can reach
202500	it like no matter what look how long
204389	that Shift key is it's like the longest
205799	key on the keyboard within the spacebar
207269	okay we do have a full-size backspace
209579	key full-size Enter key and another long
212160	Shift key let's see shift keys they're
213959	like monstrosity x' okay we haven't
216419	moved around any of the critical keys we
218849	have nice large delete key home end page
221250	up page down are all in their correct
223739	locations the scroll lock insert and
226379	insert I like this one up here because
228590	having the insert up here means that
230790	sometimes you can accidentally press it
232230	when you met backspace oh you meant
233579	delete and then you end up typing over
234959	your stuff and it compounds a small
236849	error and turns it into a much much
238680	larger error how we've also only got one
242220	Windows key so there's a Windows key
243659	here and then the other one is a
245099	function key so using the function key
246750	we can access keys that we otherwise
248459	can't access like pause and it looks
251040	like that's actually the only thing it
254159	does no couldn't be must be fascinating
258120	okay we do have a number pad layout a
261418	number lock and we have a couple media
263250	keys as well so we can access the
264599	calculator that's good for business we
266520	could also play pause reduce the volume
268440	and
269050	the volume of the music that we are
271000	listening to in our office which is
272770	bothering the others next to us and that
277330	is pretty much all that I'd have to say
280599	about it so thank you for checking out
281800	my unboxing and first look at the
283629	Comfort Curve 3000 for Microsoft don't
286000	forget to subscribe for more unboxings
287110	reviews and other computer videos oh and
289330	here's another useful feature so it
290860	actually shows you see there's a little
292300	star on the control and it shows you
294250	what all of these hotkeys actually do so
296830	you don't even have to think about it at
298569	all but I didn't even know windows D
300639	goes to the desktop see look and windows
303250	egos to my PC I know most of these other
305379	ones though
