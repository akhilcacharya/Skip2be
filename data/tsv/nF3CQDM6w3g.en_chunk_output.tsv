12960	more welcome to my overview slash review
16079	whatever you want to call it of what may
17699	seem at first like the least exceptional
20789	keyboard ever alright so it comes in a
23910	box but that's pretty much you know par
25949	for the course it's got like bubble wrap
27840	and you can take it out there's no
29670	there's no braided cable no wrist rest
32279	no real accessories in the box
34020	no detachable cable although they do
36059	have this cool little feature where you
37620	can route it around to one side if you
39329	want and get it out of the way of your
40379	your monitor or whatever else it has no
43620	audio pass-through no USB hub and
46140	basically just looks like the most
48000	boring thing ever so which you might
49140	reply okay line is find it even watching
50940	this why did you even do this well the
53250	answer is check out the link in the
56399	video description labeled pricing and
58469	availability and prepare to have your
60210	eyes fall off ya or outward whatever
63449	your eyes do when they fall yes this is
65760	a mechanical keyboard that is actually
68310	less expensive than many fully backlit
71250	membrane keyboards and it comes with a
74220	full backlight in this case blue so now
77220	I'm not hating on it let's talk about
78570	what's good about it first of all
80040	they've done nothing stupid with the
81420	layout nice standard 104 key layout
83729	without any shortened shifts or back
85950	spaces or anything like that the LED
88020	backlights are actually pretty darn good
89939	you only get 4 brightness levels so you
91619	can go all the way down to nothing or
93240	all the way up to well actually quite
95610	bright the build quality is much better
99090	than I was expecting
100170	there is almost no flex to this bad boy
102689	and I would not have pegged this for
105060	such an inexpensive mechanical keyboard
107189	if someone had just handed it to me and
108750	asked me to tell them how much I thought
111119	that it cost it has a Windows key
113040	disable key which is sort of in a weird
114600	location up at the top right but it has
116700	one
117119	it also has media keys that are handled
119219	with a function you know secondary
121710	functionality thing but it does support
123240	play pause forward back stop a volume
126210	down up and mute so it's got that
128399	functionality onboard but other than
129810	that not a whole lot depending on where
132420	you
132700	look I think on the box that says any
134410	key rollover but actually on their site
136000	it says six to eight key rollover so it
138040	does support and not rollover that for
140019	pretty much any gaming combination
141610	you're going to not going to have any
142720	difficulty and other than that what can
144879	I say about it it's a better typing
146620	experience it's very solidly built and
148930	it comes in at a very appealing price
150099	about a nice little organ ohmic you know
152260	risers at the back here that actually
153790	have rubber tips is it something you
155200	don't see that often so it won't slide
156819	whether you have it laying down flat on
158440	the table or if you have it raised and
160150	it's available with at least a three
162160	different key switch types so they've
163989	got browns reds and blues available
166269	depending on where you look and so that
169599	means it's inexpensive and there's lots
171250	of variety just like audible.com
