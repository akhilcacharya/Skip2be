30	so my first reaction to the arrival of
1890	my sample of a retail k70 RGB was like
5009	wow gee awesome I'm gonna go plug it in
8849	right now I'm gonna get me sweet and I
11400	can't wait
12480	I then proceeded to calmly and patiently
15450	wait for the new course error Utility
18150	engine queue software to download and
20939	install fired it up and after faffing
24960	about for a couple minutes realized I
26490	had no idea how to do anything so I
29820	checked the box for the manual only to
31980	discover that the reason courser makes
33870	you download the manual is that it's a
36239	hundred and forty two pages long that's
39780	when it hit me this review was going to
42450	take a while
49670	coolermaster neptune series CPU coolers
52289	are available in a variety of radiator
54090	sizes to perfectly suit your next build
56280	click now to learn more we'll start with
59250	a physical overview if you've seen one
60899	k70 you've pretty much seen them all the
63539	layout is a standard 104 key with no
65939	deal breaking alterations like a short
68460	backspace key and a couple much
70619	appreciated additions namely a hardware
73170	switch for polling rates I recommend
74880	leaving this at the default setting and
76320	bios mode which improves compatibility
78960	particularly outside of your OS on older
81780	hardware it's got a three level
83400	brightness toggle a windows lock key 5
86040	media keys and a classy looking textured
88890	metal volume wheel Corsair continues to
91530	include soft touch rubberized wrist
93570	rests and as someone who won't use a
95579	keyboard without one I consider this
97380	very important and they continue to
99720	deliver the same pleasing fit and finish
101700	that we've come to expect over the last
103020	few years with a gorgeous solid brushed
105720	aluminum backplate rubber bottom flip
108360	out feet and a braided dual USB power
110850	cord although it should be noted that
112500	the second connector with two arrows on
114720	it is not for a pass-through port but
117930	just extra power for the RGB LED
120210	lighting and significantly upgraded
121829	micro controller when you're using USB 2
124680	if you plug in via USB 3 you only need
127469	the connector with the picture of the
128788	keyboard on it and you can leave the
129989	other one dangling so let's dive right
132270	into it shall we
133830	you well publicized and much-anticipated
136550	special sauce here is Cherry's
139170	implementation for now exclusive to
141210	Corsair of RGB lighting within their MX
144240	series key switches replacing the single
147600	three millimeter to lead led embedded on
149910	the top of the switch directly below the
152070	key cap is a new system that mounts an
154560	RGB LED to the PCB of the keyboard and
158250	uses a translucent key cap housing and
160920	lens to focus the light so from the
163440	outside it looks very similar to the
165480	older style of course this would all be
168240	meaningless if performance was
169740	compromised in any way and keyboard
171450	enthusiasts will be happy to know that
173190	the tactile characteristics of the red
175950	blue and brown Cherry MX switches that
178830	this keyboard is available with that
180240	launch are untainted and another
183030	desirable side effect is that the LEDs
184890	are less susceptible to failure due to
187110	static discharge because their surface
189120	mounted in the keyboard so so far sounds
191370	good all around but of course if it's
194220	impossible to use then this is all a
196020	purely academic discussion so let's dive
198390	into the documentation for the Corsair
200670	utility engine software the main reason
203550	this keyboard has been delayed and
205380	delayed and delayed some more and find
208320	out if a little bit of good old
210600	fashioned aren t f'ing M is going to get
214260	me through this
215840	we'll start with profiles not to be
218790	confused with modes which are sort of
220620	like sub profiles profiles store their
223800	modes and foreground lighting effects
226350	and can be switched automatically when
228600	certain applications launch or manually
231209	using the system tray icon something you
233340	may find yourself doing often when
234870	setting up lighting effects since
236340	sometimes you'll have to change them to
238620	get settings to apply modes coexist with
242340	profiles you must always have one of
244800	each loaded at least they can have their
247709	own background color schemes over which
249900	the foreground lighting effects will run
251940	but they are inexplicably missing
254370	functionality like the ability to have
256560	continuous wave patterns or their own
259079	reactive typing schemes so you'll likely
261510	need a handful of profiles to get the
264060	variety that you obviously crave because
266070	you
266250	spent a couple of hundred dollars on a
267570	keyboard that lights up funny modes also
270960	store button assignments and the options
273750	here are basically endless every button
276450	on the keyboard
277110	even the LED brightness toggle which I
279240	rebound to mode switching because the
281190	keyboard lacks any dedicated buttons for
283080	that or even general purpose macro
285150	buttons is completely reprogrammable
288060	we're talking text input shortcuts to
290760	the homepage of your favorite website or
293340	applications or whatever overlaid
295650	countdown timers for gamers although
297750	that overlay features a bit of a
299160	work-in-progress Mouse dpi changes mouse
302130	movement nouse clicks separate macro
305370	execution for the downstroke and release
307530	of the key and even different lighting
309990	effects to go along with it it's pretty
311820	cumbersome but the groundwork has been
314070	laid here for coursers RGB series to be
316770	the most powerful keyboards ever made
320070	and never mind just for gaming for
321870	anything that requires execution of of
323850	macros or other complex functionality
326040	and we haven't even talked about the
329100	lighting yet it took me a few hours to
331560	get the hang of it but not at least not
333450	entirely because I'm an idiot I spent
335340	most of that time being frustrated by
337440	bugs like needing to drag a mode to the
340320	top of the list and sometimes quickly
342479	switch profiles in order to preview what
344550	I was doing and not being able to find
346650	mode switching within the actions editor
348720	because it's the one thing that's not in
351660	there no you need to right click the
354270	button instead but once I got the hang
356940	of it I found myself able to do some
358710	moderately cool stuff I can set up
360600	different key actions per mode clone my
363180	modes entirely within a profile change
365820	any key to any color I want even the
368700	media keys setup reactive typing on a
371250	single key or in a ripple effect I can
374250	set up wave starting on the side or in
376440	the center with whatever colors I want I
378570	can export the file to carry it with me
380880	to other computers or share with friends
382410	and coolest of all I can just not be
385740	arsed to do any of this and download
387720	profiles from the corsair forum where
389669	folks are already doing stuff but i
391680	couldn't figure out how to do but here i
395280	ran into another problem when you import
397740	someone else
398760	profile it adds all of the crap from
401820	theirs into yours with the only way to
404040	get around that being to manually delete
406530	them all or wipe out everything in the
408360	software and while I saw stuff that I
410490	wasn't sure how to do most of it was
413220	pretty simple different time delays
415200	longer or shorter trails on in effect
417630	more or fewer colors where's the full
420900	program ability that you promised
422640	Corsair Lua as they call it is not here
426090	yet
426480	which I guess is both encouraging and
429300	discouraging because it means it's less
430950	complicated for now but it also means
432780	that it's good to get more complicated
434070	later in order to unlock the full
435780	potential of this bad boy so I guess
438690	that leads pretty well into conclusion
440520	time and it's not a simple conclusion in
442470	the ten years I've been using Corsair
444510	products I've seen innovation and I've
447000	seen success but I've also seen failure
449160	so what is the k70 right now I would say
452340	it's both the idea is a success but the
455310	endless delays gave their competitors
457110	the better part of a year to react and
458970	bring their own solutions to market now
460920	that it's finally here I'd say the
462690	quality of the hardware is a smashing
464550	success but the software is to put it
467190	bluntly not I mean its features our
470040	success compared to other products
471570	currently on the market but compared to
473550	the expectations that they set they're
475680	not and I'm sure they'd prefer if I just
478410	ignore the uproar over the course
480690	they're gaming rebrand initiative
482370	speaking of things that are not that
484350	successful right now so the Queen a 70
488910	RGB won't be taking home an editor's
491220	choice or anything today but what I will
493230	say based on my experience with Corsair
495600	is that well this was not a smooth
497760	product launch the battle for RGB
499890	keyboard dominance is far from over for
502950	all their flaws course there's RGB
505410	keyboards have a few key advantages
507660	versus their competition number one is
509790	excitement this is the most anticipated
511849	keyboard in the history of computer
514140	enthusiasts ever as far as I can tell
516330	number two they are first to market they
519030	exist people are buying them and more
521520	importantly not returning them the bugs
523979	appear to be software rather than
526020	hardware issues which makes patching the
528060	ones in the field relatively simple and
530100	gives corsair much-needed capital
532529	to continue to develop the product and
534779	number three is that Corsair always
537569	comes up swinging when they smell blood
539339	and I bet they do right now I mean this
541499	is the first time an established gaming
544470	peripheral maker and in this case two of
546689	them has ever reacted so quickly to
549569	something little old Corsair has done
551639	and if I was those competitors I would
554399	make damn good ensure that the chroma
556199	and the G 910 are strong reactions the
559410	last time Corsair entered a category
561389	this aggressively the PC power supply
563399	and case industry was dominated by a
565889	little company called an Tech and the
568319	rest is history ain't it anyway
570839	expect to see coverage of the K 95 or K
573749	65 the macro button equipped and 10
576809	keyless variants of the K 70 when I've
579029	had a chance to scope out the
580889	competition or when Corsair turns their
583470	software from something that limps along
586490	functionally into something worthy of
588930	the course their name or the Corsair
591480	gaming name with some bat lifting or
593610	whatever it is they're calling
594959	themselves these days guys thanks for
