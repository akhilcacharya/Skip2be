30	this video from tes 2018 is brought to
2070	you by D brand makers of sick skins for
5130	your mobile devices game consoles and
6750	controllers check him out at V Francom
8790	clash des 2018 so over in monitor land
12960	the big focus for LG this year is nano
16230	cell IPS displays boasting up to 500
19770	nits peak brightness and HDR 10 support
22830	with 98% coverage at the DCI p3 color
25980	space they're showing off a 5k
28109	ultra-wide that's a first with
30449	Thunderbolt 3 input as well as display
32488	point input and finally LG freaking
36630	finally a g-sync
39110	34 inch 120 Hertz gaming display so
42480	that's about 20% faster than a sir's
45840	predator x 34 but I got distracted from
50910	the monitors and I ended up over here
52770	because already they are replacing the
57899	Graham
58770	that we just reviewed we just reviewed
63449	the core 8 gen Graham actually yeah
67040	James is using what we just got this
70049	like like a month ago and we were like
72810	okay this is a great laptop it's super
74820	light it's got great battery it's
76020	quad-core now which is flippin sick up
78119	to 16 gigs ram except for a few small
80729	issues the webcam is here which is kind
83790	of a bummer the fingerprint sensor
85470	certain biometrics is great but it's
87420	here which is kind of a bummer and this
89670	type C port isn't Thunderbolt so you
91799	just can't run it with an external
93600	graphics card well you know what this
96840	one is all of this is the buyer's
98490	remorse model because it's got a bigger
100920	battery than ever before the same
102869	structurally reinforced chassis it's got
105420	the touch sensor for your fingerprint
107189	built into the power button now so you
109320	have your full trackpad to use it's got
111899	a core I know what was the other thing
114180	oh yes it's got the webcam moved up to
117780	the top yes and finally Thunderbolt
121829	support on the ground so that means high
124140	speed external peripherals that means
126360	external graphics making it far more
129090	competitive
130050	with the blade stealth quad-core that I
132390	have been reading off of under the lens
134280	sorry to break the illusion there and
136820	basically I cannot wait to get my hands
141420	on this and run it through the paces
142650	because the one thing we're LG can lose
144960	to the blade stealth here is in max
147840	turbo speeds that's going to hurt their
149730	gaming performance compared to the
152160	blades belt if they haven't improved
153660	that since date here we go last gen
156090	Graham the last gen a month ago Graham
