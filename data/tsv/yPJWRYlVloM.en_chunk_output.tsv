30	in the future when I look back on 2014
2730	one of the main things I will remember
4680	will be the inclusion of sixteen point
6870	eight million color RGB lighting on
8550	nearly every tech product imaginable and
11670	before the year is over we will be
13769	reviewing at least one more also I got
17010	grilled pretty hard for teasing whole
18539	room water cooling video in my last
20580	review but then Opie delivered so I'm
24090	going to tease you again whole room
25740	water cooling part 2 coming soon
34700	save on select Intel CPUs knucks and
37710	SSDs with special black friday rebates
39899	from select retailers click now to learn
41910	more first off we will explore the
44399	physical features of the mouse except
46020	for the lighting which we will go into
47969	more depth later on
49379	it comes with a slightly longer than my
52050	wingspan nicely sleeved cable which ends
54780	in an unusually large USB plug which has
58260	the benefit of being delightfully easily
60149	to identify in a mess of other cables on
62609	the other end of the cable is the body
64650	of the most itself which is fairly light
66869	at just under 100 grams but
69090	unfortunately cannot be adjusted due to
71549	the lack of an included adjustable
73439	weighting system the saber optical RGB
75750	has eight programmable buttons including
77790	by default left middle right click dpi
80820	up and down forward and back and an
83130	unbound button just behind the scroll
84869	wheel while the finish on the most
86490	didn't really stand out necessarily it
88950	also didn't leave much to be desired I
91049	had no problem gripping the mouse
92729	however I tried to hold it I held this
94890	most predominantly in a claw grip
96450	however as I do that with nearly every
99270	Mouse I have because they all seem to be
101070	too small for me to be able to actually
103680	palm I asked Linus how it felt in a palm
106619	grip and he assured me that it was a
108060	great fit for his hand size under the
110070	hood the most features dual Omron
111810	switches for your left and right click
113549	along with a picsArt s39 88 sensor which
116880	I'm happy to say it doesn't seem to have
118259	any of that acceleration or any junk
120810	like that you may be familiar with this
122820	sensor as it has been used before in
124740	recent versions of the extremely popular
127110	Razer DeathAdder one thing that I must
129810	point out before moving on to the
131190	software and lighting modes is a little
133230	OCD
133880	a pet peeve of mine this is a neutral
136190	toned looking mouse with customizable
138320	lighting modes so that you can make it
140060	match almost any color setup you have
142100	but then the Corsair logo has yellow on
145340	it it's not the worst case of this since
147620	my hand would be on it most of the times
149510	I would be able to see it and Corsair is
151400	not the only brand guilty of putting
154100	unchangeable colors on a product
156050	designed to be color adjusted by the
158060	user but it's frustrating nonetheless
160700	because if I was buying it to color
162950	match everything in my setup down to the
165860	mouse even I would be driven crazy by
168560	the fact that there's a little random
170750	patch of yellow sitting there and I
172850	couldn't easily change it it's just
175130	frustrating moving on we of course
177200	there's Q software changing the mostess
179120	performance is a breeze it comes with a
181100	whopping 5 custom dpi levels which you
183530	can quick swap on the DPI up and down
185750	buttons while you're gaming 5 lift
188330	height settings and for polling rate
190040	settings are also included for those of
192170	you that wish to tune their Mouse just a
193970	little bit further also just as a quick
196190	note leave enhanced pointer precision
198770	and angle snapping unchecked especially
201560	if you're a gamer or a human all eight
205550	of the programmable mouse buttons are
207050	easy to take advantage of in the actions
209180	tab you're able to get these buttons to
211940	do basically anything from input macros
214490	text input single keystrokes short cuts
217610	dpi changes timers media control and
219890	even most input for whatever reason all
222860	of this in the software is very powerful
225860	and gives you a huge amount of
227060	granularity to your options especially
228800	once you get to the RGB settings but
232010	this is also where things got a little
233450	weird that whole easy to take advantage
235520	of thing that I brought up earlier
237709	doesn't really apply to the RGB lighting
240170	functionality of course there knows this
242090	and so do you if you've watched Linus's
244250	video on the k70 RGB keyboard and course
247610	there is working on making improvements
249470	to their software but as of right now
251270	it's kind of a mess they have something
253670	like 9 videos on their Channel alone
256100	just to help people set this up and all
259279	coming from an HCI or human-computer
261738	interaction standpoint it's ugly
264740	I mean aesthetic leave shirred it looks
266900	great but in
267860	forms of usability it's pretty rough
270319	having tabs in different places with the
272810	same name doing drastically different
274909	things and having options hidden away
277699	and right-click menus that should really
280280	just be buttons are just the tip of the
283069	iceberg if you manage to read the
285139	massive 140 page ish manual and trudge
288860	through their forums for a while you can
290840	get the hang of it and do some really
292490	cool stuff but for people wanting a
294590	super quick setup your options will
296960	probably be limited to the quick select
299629	modes even just the inclusion of being
302569	able to click on a lighting zone and
304849	have an RGB color wheel pop up and
307009	allowing you to select a color manually
308960	or even put in a custom RGB code would
311840	have been a huge redeeming point but
315560	alas no dice the Sabre wasn't made for
318500	board games though so we don't need dice
320659	and this conclusion is pretty
322759	straightforward if you're a PC gamer not
325189	a tabletop gamer the most is physically
327379	quite standard and with the reputable
329419	sensor and switches the setup is then
332509	augmented by an extremely powerful
334460	software package hampered by an
337669	attractive but also limited UI it still
342080	needs its usability tweaks but Corsair
344000	seems to be building an extremely
345740	powerful RGB ecosystem for a consumer
348289	base that obviously wants it it's just
351639	unfortunately not quite there yet
354949	that being said thankfully none of these
357199	problems will affect the raw performance
359300	and since they are all software based
361669	they could be there they could be there
363740	and fixed in the future while you have
365930	fun with the rest of your mouse now
367610	speaking of things being pretty
369169	straightforward

371629	definitely check out crunchy roll with
373400	crunchy roll premium you can watch as
