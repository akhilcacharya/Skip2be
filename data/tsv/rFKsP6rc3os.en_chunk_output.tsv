4850	the arc MIDI r2 by fractal design
7620	features massive air flow and highly
9570	flexible liquid cooling support click
11340	now to learn more welcome to my unboxing
14429	of something that's actually really
16619	really exciting this is the 8 rocks from
19199	Razer they have sent a metric but ton of
23699	time developing this product in
25760	collaboration with gamers who really
27779	understand what you need in a fight
30900	stick because it is a very specialized
33510	piece of hardware for the kinds of
35579	people who I think that their blurb on
37590	the side of the box really will speak to
40350	those guys that are going to care about
42840	the tactile feedback of the buttons on a
45539	fight stick the way that geeks like me
47760	care about the tactile feedback on
49620	something like a keyboard so they have
51809	this whole long thing and that basically
54059	ends with forged from the fires of an
56430	arcade gaming legacy the Razer aatrox is
58800	in the most primeval sense bred to fight
62219	so they are looking to a replicate or at
65159	least get as close as possible to the
66900	feel of an actual arcade with well I
69840	mean by the time you buy one of these
71520	and then stop going to arcades and
73500	feeding
73950	endless amounts of money into the
75990	machines they're actually it starts to
78390	look like a pretty good pretty good
79920	value although it isn't inexpensive and
82200	there's a very good reason for it so the
84210	Atrix comes in a nice colorful outer box
86759	and then a more simple sort of what
89130	we've come to expect from their system
91079	components brown box and the usual
95490	excellent Razer packaging with a letter
97619	from their chief gamer as well as some
100770	instructional guides and all those kinds
103140	of things that you may actually need for
104369	this product because there are some cool
106710	features that you're going to want to
108869	use for sure you also get a couple of
110640	Razer stickers which you can go ahead
111930	and stick on this product or on
113369	something else
114030	first things first that foam check it
117899	out love it nice closed cell foam the
120840	fight stick might be ruggedly built but
123000	they're not taking any chances and that
125130	thing will arrive in one piece I can
127500	pretty much give that my personal
129000	guarantee it also comes packed in an
130979	electrostatic Bay
132680	which blew and I almost dropped it yep
135620	we were going to do a rugged ability
137599	durability test right there just like
139849	that and finally some plastic covers
143000	that keep it from popping open during
144890	shipping because the inside of the
146870	fightstick does come apart so let's
149420	start with an exterior tour so the first
152269	thing we're going to see is this is an
154069	Xbox optimized controller so you're
156829	going to have an Xbox button as well as
159109	default key mappings to all of the Xbox
161450	controller functionality that you would
163340	expect except for this guy right here
165139	obviously there's only one analog stick
167569	however you can rebind that two left
169849	stick right stick or d-pad as you see
172940	fit with the dip switch up here you can
174980	also unlock and lock this stuff so that
177290	if you accidentally mash something in
178939	slip it's not going to go ahead and go
180980	to the menu of your Xbox or anything
182659	like that in the middle of the gaming
184340	session they're using genuine Sanwa
186439	components however you might decide that
188720	you want something completely different
190519	and that is where the customizability
192739	comes in so that is for both the
194269	joystick as well as the eight buttons
197060	over here check this out let's open this
200120	up using the button right here actually
201620	okay no no no no I didn't finish the
203180	outside yet okay sorry so start and back
205160	or over on the right over here and then
207410	over here we find nothing but the
209239	interface connector so that's for the
211129	four meter included cord so you're going
212840	to be able to sit adequately far away
214220	from your TV then here we've got nothing
216650	here we've got that button that I teased
218389	you about before but you know don't
219919	worry we'll actually show it to you
221090	later and then on the bottom we find a
222949	nice rubber pad that's going to allow it
225919	to sit on your lap or on a desk or
227840	wherever else you prefer to put it
229159	without it slipping so now we can open
231109	up and have a look at the inside this is
234260	where things get really cool so there's
236060	a nice little hydraulic thing right here
238250	that opens up and allows it to not you
241010	know close on its own accidentally
242540	you've got a convenient little color
244430	labeled action button guide up here and
246979	all of the buttons are completely
249799	swappable simply by there we go
252560	and there's a way to do this I'm quite
255440	certain of it yes there we go
259279	simply by popping off the leads and then
262190	popping them through the front of the
265789	device
266090	just like that so you can change out for
268310	a completely different tactile feel
269990	should you so desire and they wanted to
273290	make it as modder friendly as possible
274699	so same thing here so you can swap out
277130	the joystick in fact it includes a
279110	different joystick knob if you hit
282620	joystick knob if you prefer that so
285080	there's a ball one on there now and this
286790	is get sealed in the bag there it is
293180	there we go so there's the alternate
295550	knob that's also included and then
297139	they've got what their but I guess I
298850	would call like modding friendly
300530	mounting points down here so you can
302720	actually mount additional component tree
304580	or whatever else you want to do in order
306020	to customize the fightstick and these
308240	are all meant to have screws driven into
310790	them so you can put you know PCBs or
312500	whatever else you would desire to do it
314720	also includes a flathead and Phillips
317060	combo screw driver although I'm sure if
318800	you're really that into these things
320360	you're going to have your own screw
321320	driver at this point in time as well as
323539	the four meter wire that I mentioned
326210	before so we can find out how long this
329120	is in - arm lengths but it might
331400	actually take a while okay so basically
333950	it's really really long it terminates in
338240	a standard breakaway connector so you
340160	xbox folks will probably going to be
341990	familiar with this one but of course it
344120	also runs from off USB so it does work
346789	on the PC just fine which is excellent
350240	for folks like me who are going to be
351680	using it there so since we showed you
353810	guys the button swapping procedure which
355639	was very straightforward you can
356780	actually open up this box right here as
358580	well if you want to really get into the
360020	nitty-gritty of things so all you got to
361700	do is go ahead and hold that screw in
363410	place and then you can swap out the
365270	stock joystick there we go which
367970	actually has a different texture to it
369349	as well so the bat one has a bit of a of
372800	a rough texture and then these the
375740	spherical one has a glassy texture so
378229	you just go ahead and screw that back on
379970	I'm just holding this in place with my
381650	finger for now and then I can go ahead
384139	and use the included tool there we go
386650	lock that into place now I missed
390860	something on the outside before and that
392419	was the Xbox headset connector down here
394969	so you're not going to have to worry
395990	about not having voice communication and
397729	I also wanted to go into
399440	little bit more depth about these guys
401090	right here so these are turbo buttons
402710	you can program them completely without
405830	any software which is great because
408020	you're not going to be expected to
409190	install a driver on your xbox dur so all
411890	you got to do is there's a button
413180	combination I forget what it is but it's
414710	something to do with holding like one
415910	and eight and something else anyway so
417410	you can program them for either a four
419720	four actions per second repeat rate or
422210	an eight actions per second repeat rate
424130	and then you bind them to any particular
427550	button that you want so it glows solid
430760	when it's set to four and it glows or
433070	blinks rather when it's set to eight and
435440	then it's not illuminated when the turbo
438170	functionality is off so that's
439730	definitely something that you're going
441020	to want to set up pretty much
442360	immediately when you're aatrox arrives
444740	thank you for checking out my unboxing
446720	and overview that also missed yet
449090	another thing you can swap out the
450650	graphics on the top should you so desire
452510	it's part of the whole modular design
455360	concept thing you just undo these screws
457160	you can put in whatever artwork you want
458840	and now I'm actually done click like on
461030	the video if you liked it click dislike
462680	if you disliked it leave a comment if
464900	you really disliked it and don't forget
467630	to share if you think anyone might find
469850	this little guy kind of cool
