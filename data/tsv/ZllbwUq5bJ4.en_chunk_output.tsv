30	so today we're going to be having a
1770	quick look at the razor abysus mouse so
4500	this is a high precision optical gaming
7290	mouse and razer does a great job of
8760	their packaging so we can pretty much
10230	tell you everything about this product
12269	just based on what they've put on the
13740	outside so first of all you've got a
15599	handy little valve for a window in to
18150	have a look at the mouse itself although
20039	they even tell you how to pronounce it
23100	so abyss Oz is abysus whatever okay it's
27900	a noun derived from the something a
30090	venomous pit viper subsidies found only
31980	in the United States blah blah blah 3500
34620	DPI 3.5 G's of acceleration awesome till
38520	they've added a really good sensor to
40980	even their value line of gaming mice
43290	which is really cool because it means
45570	that we're starting to see actually not
46980	just from razer but a lot of really high
48899	performance value gaming mice so here
51210	you can see it's reiterated we've got
53460	the 3500 DPI razor precision 3.5 g
56219	infrared sensor three buttons tuned for
58920	ultra responsive feedback so that means
60899	you've got a left click or right click
61859	and a middle click and then you've got
63600	Hardware toggles for dpi and polling
65549	rates that's always really nice to have
67020	those are on the bottom of the mouse
68400	though so on the higher end mice you'll
70140	tend to find those buttons on the top ok
72450	English digital ultra wide data path on
76020	the fly sensitivity adjustment and the
78000	dexterous design so they have released a
80369	couple mice lately that don't have
81900	completely ambidextrous designs but this
83850	one is back to their roots a little bit
86100	so you can use it with either your right
87810	or your left hand it has a seven foot
89759	lightweight non tangle cord that did it
93079	okay you know what let's just get this
95070	thing open and we will go from there so
96900	I actually have ah my keys on me and I'm
100500	going to use that to open red box here
104630	and see normally I actually started
106950	opening the box before I stopped talking
110790	about the product so that I'll have
112229	something to talk about while I'm
113549	opening the box but today I didn't
115259	really do that so yeah I fail anyway
118079	let's have a look at the accessories
119310	that are included with the abysus first
121939	okay we have a like a black package here
125040	clip to the back razor just such a great
126689	job of packaging actually a great
128399	example would be these like cosa mirror
130709	unboxing
132290	product showcase that I did you can just
134540	see what a phenomenal job they do the
135950	packaging some of their stuff so for
137900	gamers by gamers Razer zone comm you
140450	find our little pack here that has all
143090	of our necessary stuff inside so on the
147290	top you have a certificate of
148549	authenticity this is a real Razer
150470	product certified by Razer guy himself
152989	next you have a Quick Start Guide which
155659	basically shows you how to plug a USB
157549	port in and it also tells you where all
160129	the buttons are on the mouse great Thank
163400	You Razer all right then you have a
165379	master guide so that I don't know how
167269	they managed to make such a fit guide on
168920	a mouse but I'm going to guess okay I'm
171230	going to go ahead and guess that it's
172340	just in a bunch of different languages
173569	and pretty much tells us what all the
175310	buttons are and how to plug it into your
176900	computer yes thank you oh no they give
179299	you a pup this is kind of nice it's so
181370	rare these days to see a hardware vendor
184010	give you an actual instruction guide on
185870	how to use the software so often they
188030	just kind of throw you in and let you
190909	sink or swim that's great okay then they
193069	have a Razer product catalog so you
194780	bought this one now by other Razer
197000	products to match not a bad strategy
199190	overall so they show you a bunch of
200720	really cool stairs the light go Samir
202160	I've unboxed that one
203419	I've unboxed the Mako speakers which are
205579	awesome by the way
206810	okay then we've got some Razer stickers
209120	and then we have the abysus so this is a
211940	little bit of a card on this Mouse and
214819	why it's so great it seems like it seems
217010	kind of weird to sell a product on
218540	someone who just bought it but maybe
220370	that's part of the unboxing experience
221780	as you're unboxing this product hey you
223940	should feel good about buying this
225019	because it's back to the basics quality
227690	reliability performance no-nonsense
230470	straightforward gaming grade
232190	fundamentals that is what they are
234319	saying about the abysus this is a
236000	no-nonsense product meant for just
237919	performance no frills no gimmicks just
240250	gaming alright so let's get this up so
243530	this is one of the first Razer products
245060	that I've seen without a braided cord
246919	but it is quite a flexible cord so
249709	you're not going to find it getting
251030	stiff when you're actually trying to
252229	move the mouse back and forth and you
254030	can see even if you're moving front to
256190	back front to back you can bend it quite
258738	easily there's not a lot of resistance
260089	there
260660	so here's a look at the top of the mouse
262190	itself now I have quite small hands I'm
264500	gonna get the cameraman to have a quick
265790	zoom in here so you can see kind of from
267950	the side what it will look like with my
270260	hand on it so there you go it's a bit of
272810	a smaller Mouse but that's typical of a
274580	razor this is more of a claw tight grip
276380	Mouse rather than a palming Mouse
277700	because it's so short alright so here
279890	are your hyper response buttons on the
281390	top and razor buttons it's kind of a
283340	love or hate sort of thing but they
285170	usually have a very responsive trigger
287930	on them they're not a very heavy click
289760	and you can see that that trend is
291200	continued here with the abysus the
293090	scroll wheel feels quite nice and has a
294740	rubberized grip on the top as does the
296780	entire top of the mouse okay and then
299300	let's go around to the bottom here so
300650	here are our hardware switches for 125
304700	Hertz or 1000 Hertz so it depends how
307400	many times you want the mouse
308630	communicating with your computer per
310160	second and then you can also adjust your
312110	dpi anywhere from 450 to 1,800 to 3500
315530	depending on whether you are a low or
317420	high sensitivity gamer they've also
319250	included a couple of slippy pads on the
321260	bottom they've got three on some of the
323090	higher and mouse mice you'll find larger
325010	pads but I mean you can only ask for so
327200	much out of a value product and it is
329360	enough for it to perform so thank you
331370	for checking out my unboxing of the
332810	Razer abysus
