6319	the Vengeance n9t yes I'm doing both of
10110	the 90 series vengeance products at the
13080	same time here and that is because i
16139	just got both of them has a great box
20460	which comes apart very easily I think
22350	this is a wonderful innovation because
24630	most blister packs I could like get a
27180	blister and the cut just trying to open
29279	them up and Corsair has solved that
31920	problem for me in a big way
33719	so the m90 is pretty similar to the m60
37170	just like the K 90 that's that's the
39989	keyboards that you know m4 Mouse k4
42510	keyboard just like the K 90 is very
45899	similar to the K 60 although I'd say the
48149	two mics are actually more similar to
50520	each other than the keyboards are
52199	because the K 90 has some real like
55410	killer features that the K 60 does not
59850	have whereas the m9 t is more of a
62899	personal preference thing as opposed to
67310	by just simply having more features like
69689	the K 90 has a backlight and the K 60
71729	doesn't whereas the m9 t is an MMO
74909	optimized Mouse you can see all these
77729	buttons over here we've actually got
79860	nine side mounted buttons here and the
84380	Toreros I going with that right and
87570	whereas the m60 has like a dpi are not
91110	DPI lowering a sensitivity lowering
93150	sniping button here and a couple side
95250	buttons because it's more optimized for
97500	fps so I'm gonna start this video by
100790	showing you guys one of the other and an
104399	O oriented mice that I happen to have
106259	here in my tech tips room and that is
108930	the Razer Naga so we're gonna compare
111450	the approaches that are taken by these
113430	two companies the WoW Mouse is another
115619	example of an MMO optimized Mouse and
118799	the WoW Mouse I personally found very
121170	difficult to use due to my small hands I
123090	can't reach a lot of the buttons the
124860	Naga I really like love this Mouse great
127890	sensor great buttons great shape however
130889	I never
132420	ever use more than about three or four
136290	of these maybe the top six because by
138930	the time I'm reaching back here I can't
140880	tell if I'm this far back or this far
142620	back I don't know what button I'm
143760	pressing yes they do have dimples on
145950	them but in the heat of the moment when
147600	you're like mana potion and a potion
148860	it's not actually that easy to tell
151680	what's what bring on the m9 t so the m9
156240	t positions the buttons in a way that
158430	you can actually easily feel which
161250	button is which pretty much regardless
163410	of the shape and size of your hands
165209	because you can you grip it more like in
167130	a claw grip this is the way I would grip
168989	this muscle that you can palm it if you
170670	want and then your thumb rests right
173459	here see how it has a blank spot that's
175200	another thing that I've heard cool I
176550	don't personally have this problem but
177750	I've heard complained about the Naga a
179130	lot is that the whole sides of button so
181080	when you go to pick up the mouse you
182100	accidentally mash things Corsair has
184170	given you a place to actually rest your
186390	thumb so you can easily very easily lift
188459	it up and it's a bit of a heavy Mouse
189780	and doesn't have the the weights the
192480	adjustable weights like the m60 so that
195630	could be a factor for you that you can
197519	grip it very easily okay now they've
199799	positioned the buttons in a way that you
201750	use a different part of your thumb to
203670	actuate almost every part of every
205860	button which means that you'll almost
207450	never make a mistake the very tip of
209040	your thumb goes here this part of your
211530	thumb goes here this part of your thumb
214350	goes here this part of your thumb is
217350	used to actuate this one you slide back
220560	a little bit and you just kind of mash
222329	right under the knuckle here in order to
224610	press this button you slide back and
226980	you've got two options here and here and
229739	then at the bottom you've got here and
232200	here you can very distinctly feel look
235200	how big the spaces are in particular
237600	between the buttons that are very close
239310	together that is so you can easily feel
241829	which button is which and use all nine
244890	of them in a useful manner now we've
247560	also got a very similar to the way it's
249989	implemented on the Naga which personally
252359	I don't prefer I would the first thing
254070	I'll do with this mouse is I'll rebind
255900	back and forward to something on the
258000	side as you've got your back and forward
260220	buttons here so you've got a couple more
261660	buttons next to the left and the right
263580	click which brings us up to
265139	seven buttons 12 13 14 look at that plus
270449	the middle click 15 actual places where
273120	you can click this mouse okay what else
276419	we got here so it's a 5700 DPI sensor
278789	that is just like the m60 as well I've
281099	used the m9 D a fair bit I know I'm
283199	unboxing this one but I have another one
284819	already that I thought that I played
286590	around with a little bit really like the
288509	way the sensor tracks I've tried it on a
290129	variety of different surfaces including
292020	just a plain table cloth cloth mousepad
294689	hard mousepad part most pad and I
298139	haven't had any difficulty with it
299789	whatsoever
300479	this guy's got 48 K of on-board
303139	dynamically knowledge memory for showing
305129	up to 6 on the go profiles which is kind
307229	of neat and then we've also got
309169	indicators over here for which profile
312120	we happen to be using so that's kind of
315870	neat the aluminum frame yeah let's talk
317729	about the aluminum frame and
318870	construction so the the K 60 has a bit
321360	more of like a bare-bones
322560	look because you can kind of see the
324839	shape of the frame whereas this one is
326430	more like more like a traditional mouth
328770	shape but it still does have that
332310	aluminum construction so you can see the
333990	shape here you can see there's two
335909	pieces of aluminum here that come
337650	together to form this mouth so what that
339360	gives it is a little bit more weight and
341399	it also gives it a very solid feel now
343289	people might complain about something
344879	like the weight of an iPhone 4 but
346409	personally I find you go when you build
348659	it out of aluminum and glass yeah it
350550	weighs a lot but it weighs a lot in the
352379	way that an SLR camera weighs a lot
354659	you're like yeah
355589	quality whereas sometimes things weigh a
358259	lot and you're like yeah heavy piece of
360419	plastic so personally I don't mind if my
363750	camera weighs a little bit more than
365460	average if my power supply weighs a
367020	little bit more than average if my mouse
369029	weighs a little bit more than average
370199	you know I'm okay with that too because
371819	it does give it an incredibly solid feel
374279	you can see the whole thing is screwed
375779	together with screws not you know little
378569	cheapo plastic clips
379830	nothing like that course there's really
381479	over done I would say the construction
384089	of this particular Mouse which includes
385620	the scroll wheel as well great rubber
388129	dimples making it very very easy to
391169	scroll up and down and control it
392610	perfectly and then metal rings on the
394740	sides also very very strong it's like
397289	what
397569	expect you to do with this thing throw
398979	it out the lot that might happen so
401559	there you go
402639	we've got right non-slip E or rather non
405909	slippy slippy feet on the bottom of a
407770	mouse covering all sides that should
409929	pretty much cover any direction you
411759	might want to move the mouse and make
413110	sure that you don't accidentally grip
415599	things too high to me remember when that
416800	was like a big deal it's like yeah the
418300	most has like Teflon feet on the bottom
420639	now they pretty much all do so all right
424029	cable length yeah okay so it's just over
426909	a line of thumb spin which means it's
428649	muttley around seven feet not a hundred
431889	percent sure about that I don't think it
433449	matters that much it's very long you
435039	won't have trouble with it you've also
436509	got gold plated connectors actually you
439300	can see them better through the top gold
440529	plated connectors so even though this
442569	outside part actually this is funny
444999	because a lot of gold plated here must
446800	be actually it's gold plated on the
448719	outside which doesn't make any contact
450819	with any any data connection so it's
452919	totally useless but no this is actually
455439	gold plated where it counts the reason
457300	the gold plating matters is because it's
458679	a malleable metal helps it to make good
460360	contact with the inside of the USB port
462550	let me just make sure I haven't missed
464110	anything here guys all right adjustable
467409	lift distance so you can decide how far
469449	off the table a lift is registered okay
473889	and it'll stop it'll stop actually
475419	moving the mouth side to side and where
478839	I got such good packaging it's always
480309	got like all the information on it no
482199	problem 15 and event and yeah
483999	individually programmable buttons so you
486129	want to go ahead and download the
488800	software at Corsair comm slash a
491319	vengeance m90 so they've got a little
493149	preview of it here which is what I
495339	usually tell you people to do anyway
496959	it's got a two year warranty on this guy
503249	can change the polling rate 1,000 Hertz
508289	5500 Hertz 250 Hertz 125 Hertz okay
510939	tracking up two hundred and sixty five
512409	hundred vintages per second and up to 30
514208	G's of acceleration personally that
515679	doesn't mean nearly as much to me as
517000	when I use the mouse
519110	and I go oh yeah that sensor feels good
520760	some mice that are they're really high
522500	DPI but you just you go to use them
524360	you're like oh this is crap sensor it's
525890	not it's not imaging the surface below
528020	it nearly well enough okay last thing
532060	overall texture the mouse so it's got
534980	kind of a smooth soft touch turned of
538310	grip on the top here and then it's got a
540800	bit of a smooth like hard plastic one
542870	here which is fine but on the other side
544760	they've gone with kind of a rough so you
547580	can actually see it rubbing away some of
549470	my skin there you buy it's quite rough
551390	and I think that's awesome because what
554000	that means is that it's smooth and soft
556220	to the touch where you're resting on it
557660	and then it's got enough grip on the
559370	sides and enough of a lip on the other
561050	side that you can easily lift it up you
563360	know in some in the heat of battle so to
565250	speak I think that pretty much covers it
567680	we've got an illuminated Corsair logo
569450	here and we have nice you know
572090	high-quality braided cable here thank
