30	razor sabertooth controller works on
2070	Xbox 360 and PC oled screen 10-foot
4980	detachable cable for hyper responsive
6690	buttons and six additional multifunction
9210	buttons the jazz mini phone and tablet
18119	stand from Coolermaster is now available
20100	in a variety of cool colors from these

23609	all right you guys know me I didn't
26519	really bother to try this out on an Xbox
28170	360 but I'm sure it works just fine I
31140	did try it on a PC however and all it
33690	really needed once I plugged it in was
35130	for Windows to auto detect a driver
36630	install and it was ready to go yes that
39149	does mean that this controller doesn't
40710	use Razer synapse 2.0 software
42440	personally I like that because I'm not a
44399	huge fan of background processes of
46469	pretty much any sort and keeping my
48960	processes down is a constant battle for
50550	me but this does mean that you're maxed
52949	out to the two profiles that fit on the
54570	controller that being said personally I
57149	don't see myself using more than those
58859	two profiles so it's probably fine
61140	speaking of profiles the OLED screen is
63359	responsive and easy to use especially if
65188	you're just trying to change something
66090	simple like a profile which can be done
68580	with the button on the left of the
70080	little screen changing anything from
71820	either profile is handled by the button
73920	on the right with some help from the
75540	d-pads up and down buttons for changing
77250	menu rotation and a and B for different
79799	selections in the customization menu you
81900	can do anything from turning rumble
83700	and/or the backlight on or off to
86340	advance things like testing mode which
88290	can be used to test the precision of
89850	your analog sticks and prove to your
91950	friends that it isn't actually the
93659	controllers fault and they just need to
94979	get on your level and last but not least
97170	is program mode in program mode all you
99360	need to do is hold down the
100530	multifunction button that you want to
102240	bind and tap the button you want to bind
104549	it to for instance if you wanted to bind
106110	multi-function button 6 to a key I would
109320	hold that button down and then press the
111240	button you want to bind it to once
112979	you've done that exit the little menu on
114630	the OLED screen to get back to the razor
116219	screen and you're good to go
117600	next up is the detachable cable which is
119610	nicely braided and comes with a screw-on
121320	connector which as long as you remember
123390	to line it up properly is quite easy to
125579	plug in correctly this is really nice to
127710	see on a premium level controller some
129568	people may not care about the detachable
131440	Kable if they don't plan to travel with
132820	their controller but I travel with my
134980	xbox360 controller is quite a bit
136810	because they make playing games in
138460	cramped and awkward spaces like say an
140800	airplane seat a lot easier I'll
143320	definitely appreciate the detachable
144730	cable as I believe one of my controllers
146530	has likely died from cable torquing in
148420	my bag this one time when I was going
150430	over to ferry to the island didn't work
152230	on the other end so yeah that sucked
154360	next up we have all the input buttons
156490	the thumbsticks seem fairly standard and
159220	they're finished quite nicely and in the
161290	packaging they have some Razer green
163180	colored tops for the thumb sticks which
165220	can change the feel and protect your
166690	thumb sticks from where person I'll be
168400	leaving them off of mine because I feel
170710	like my thumbs kind of slip off of them
172210	while they're on and I'm not too worried
174130	about the durability as they're actually
175540	quite nice Lim sticks the d-pad is
177370	pretty nice and an improvement over the
179170	Anza in my opinion but I wouldn't really
181300	want to play a platformer on it
183010	personally that being said the separated
185170	buttons would be really nice for
186790	QuickTime events as I doubt there would
188380	be as many wrong inputs which can be
190570	very frustrating most games that I play
192970	on this controller wouldn't be
194260	platformers anyways or I could just use
196630	the analog stick in that platformer like
198220	I did in shovelknight fantastic game by
200620	the way the hyper responsive buttons are
202840	actually hyper responsive the audio and
205150	tactile feedback is fantastic when and
207430	when paired up with a short travel
208570	length it feels great when spamming
210100	kinda reminds me of typing on a cherry
211780	blue switch keyboard - the obvious
213370	travel length differences and then we
215620	come to the multifunction buttons the
217209	em1 and em2 shoulder buttons are just
219160	enough out of the way that they don't
220150	feel like I would accidentally press
221800	them and just enough in the way that I
224230	could press them easily if I actually
225790	needed to and the story doesn't differ
228190	much for the M 3 through 6 buttons on
230680	the back these I'll admit I was pretty
232780	worried about with my fairly large hands
234610	I expected them to be crazy annoying but
236950	they happen to sit in just the right
238840	position that they don't really bother
240130	me and if I did Razer includes a
242980	screwdriver to remove them and rubber
244540	plugs to fill the holes once you do nice
247380	just three more things guys one it's not
250390	Wireless 2 it has a 2.5 billion metre
253060	microphone jack on the bottom if you're
255040	into that sort of thing and last but not
256930	least 3 if you're running xpadder and
259478	you're kind of a guru and you plan on
260738	running custom controls on every button
263110	you're slightly out of luck
264850	due to
265150	controller handling the rebinding of the
266949	multifunction keys you can only bind
269050	said keys to other keys on the
271540	controller so say if you bind a two
273880	space bar you could bind m4 to a which
278020	would then be spacebar but you couldn't
280539	find m4 to spacebar directly it has to
282850	go through the bind of another button on
284530	the controller it can't be independent
286780	all right guys I'm still not necessarily
289300	done my search because it's a pretty big
290620	decision for me if this lasts as long as
292720	my xbox360 controller did I'll be using
295150	this for a long time I got my xbox 360
297580	controller on launch what like eight or
299919	nine years ago what do you guys think
301630	I'd love to get your input down below or
303760	on the forum and while you're down there
305470	don't forget to like or dislike the
307030	video favorite the video share the video
308919	subscribe to the channel and donate up
311470	for on the forum because that gets rid
312850	of all the ads and I know you're not
314199	running ad blocker right so yeah don't
315910	even worry about at all if you want a
317289	shirt that's again not this shirt be
319960	sure to check out the link in the
