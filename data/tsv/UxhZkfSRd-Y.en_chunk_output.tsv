30	welcome to another outdoor unboxing
1860	today we've got the Logitech G 100's
4230	which is part of the new Logitech G
7049	series now it's a bit perplexing to me
9450	that they've gone and branded this the G
11280	Series because logitech's had a G series
13200	for a long time but what they've done is
14969	they've reinvented most of the G Series
17430	with a couple of different things so
19830	number one is check this out advanced
22050	surface materials feel the difference a
23939	durable hydrophobic palm surface and
26250	fingerprint resistant button coatings so
27900	they've what they've attempted to do is
30529	engineer a surface that is not going to
33540	get all oily and greasy and ugly and
36420	gross so I'm really looking forward to
38879	opening it up and checking it out this
40469	particular one the G 100's is the lowest
42930	end out of the new G series so it's
44850	rated at 250 to 2500 dpi which quite
48780	frankly unless you are a super high
51420	sensitivity gamer or you're running with
54090	a triple monitor surround setup is
56070	probably going to be enough for you
57840	anyway up to five hundred reports per
60539	second this is a strange differentiation
62910	for me because most mice these days are
65400	able to do a thousand Hertz but honestly
67680	you're probably not going to notice the
68939	difference between one millisecond and
70680	two milliseconds in terms of the overall
72630	input lag of your system but this is
75810	cool check this out so durability wise
77400	even though this is an entry-level mouse
79080	it's rated at 20 million clicks there
81600	are many gaming grade mice from
83430	competitors that are rated at less than
85860	20 million clicks or even ones that are
88530	significantly more expensive that are
90030	only rated at 20 million clicks oh it
91470	looks so I mean Logitech has always sort
93329	of gone for make sure it's durable first
96060	then figure out the fancy dancy features
98579	later and it looks like that trend
100950	continues with the G 100's so we're just
103079	going to open it up inside this is a bit
104729	of a different packaging strategy than
106920	I've seen from Logitech in the past so
108509	it's got like a blue sort of look to it
110490	which I guess goes along with the blue
112470	for the product branding as well as
115049	they're sort of achieved through science
117200	messaging that they've got for these
119070	mice so they're talking about their
120689	exclusive delta0 sensor for consistent
123240	high accuracy targeting comfortable
125250	ambidextrous shape and advanced surface
126780	coatings for improved handling that's
128520	pretty much all we've got there which
130440	leads us to the mouse itself so
132600	so in terms of the overall shape
134220	honestly it doesn't look that different
136320	from you know like the mouse mouse the
139590	mo u.s. Mouse that you can get at sort
141930	of any kind of store so you've got your
144290	Teflon feet on the bottom
145950	polytetrafluoroethylene or whatever the
147930	actual name is it because Teflon is a
149340	brand name you've also got their
151020	invisible optic branding right here
152670	above the sensor so this is an optical
154710	mouse not a laser mouse which stands to
157230	reason because that's why we've got the
159030	lower sensitivity than you would see on
160710	a typical gaming grade laser mouse so
163020	the the difference with something like
165630	this between like I said what looks like
168810	an MoU s Mouse like you would get for
170850	$4.99 in the bin is not necessarily
173400	what's gone into the looks of it but the
176490	quality of the switches so the fact that
177990	they are rated for 20 million clicks
179460	which is going to be important for
180480	gamers where you're going like lick lick
182010	lick lick lick fire fire fire fire fire
183270	most people don't use a computer like
185190	that so if you want something that's
186450	going to last longer there you go and
187890	then the other thing is of course the
190110	grade of the laser inside you don't find
192300	any of the sort of extra frills and
194340	bells and whistles like a braided cable
196500	or you know a gold-plated connector but
199350	quite frankly the part of the connector
201180	that actually matters is gold-plated
203160	because when the gold plate this outer
204840	part here it doesn't even do anything
206940	because that's not a contact point for
208830	the mouse the contact points are inside
211350	the connector here and even on the G
213360	100's and they are gold-plated now in
215820	terms of size it's a pretty comfortable
218010	size for me to almost pulp so I would
221460	normally use a mouse like this in more
223200	of a claw grip so I have slightly
225030	smaller male hands and I would hold it
228090	about like this where I can put my palm
229530	on the back but I wouldn't quite cut it
231240	like I would do with something more like
232620	a G 400s which we'll be taking a look at
234990	as well other than the standard buttons
237360	you left the right click your middle
238590	click and your scroll wheel there's just
240060	a dpi switcher here in the middle and
241590	that's pretty much it thanks for
242670	checking out my unboxing and first look
244110	at the G 100 s from Logitech don't
