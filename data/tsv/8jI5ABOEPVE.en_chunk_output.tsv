0	this video is brought to you by our
1770	trusted graphics partner Nvidia this is
5430	gonna be a bit of a batch unboxing so
7290	we're gonna go as quickly as we can here
9630	we've got the Marauder keyboard the
11700	Banshee headset as well as the spectre
13830	mouse from Razer however these are the
16199	new part of the swarm Edition peripheral
18510	so let's start with the Marauder which
20070	has according to Razer
22160	elevated keys with optimized travel
24840	distance okay so this is they're going
26340	for RTS optimization here it also has
28650	on-the-fly macro recording which I
30570	personally think is great not having to
32279	open up the utility in order to set up
34380	any macros that I want to use as well as
36960	last but not least there a PM lighting
38879	system all three of these peripherals
40469	have the APM lighting system which
42450	changes the changes the lighting scheme
45120	depending on what kind of actions per
47250	minute you're actually putting through
48450	it now the only things razors really
50100	change with these peripherals is the box
51870	art so you can see the box art is purple
53730	but our keyboard actually shipped by
56699	default with a blue color scheme just
58530	like the original wings of Liberty
60600	Marauders so not much has changed there
62309	the good news Starcraft players is that
64680	you can change the color scheme to
66270	whatever you want without any difficulty
68939	so let's move on to the Spector Mouse
70920	I'm just gonna prop this up on the
72360	keyboard here so my so my close-up
74790	camera can check it out if they want so
76920	the Spector Mouse has broad buttons it's
79590	pretty much impossible to miss them it's
81659	got the same APM optimized lighting
84750	scheme that can change things around
85979	depending on your actions per minute
87299	which i think is cool lighting is down
89280	the side of the mouse as well as the
90509	starcraft2 logo on the top the scroll
92909	wheel has 24 individual clicks which is
95009	something razors started calling out on
96630	their mice recently apparently more
99000	clicks is is a good thing although I can
101100	think I mean if you bound it to
102390	something you wanted to execute actions
103649	quickly that would be a good thing to
105299	use it for and you've got your left and
108420	your left buttons that are your back and
110700	forward it's an ambidextrous design but
112979	there are only buttons on the one side
114990	so as a lefty you're not going to be
117000	able to bind back and forward to your
118469	thumb you'd have to try to use the
119790	buttons with your pinky which is not
121740	really that optimal so it's ambidextrous
123840	shape with more of a right-handed design
126299	now the bottom of the mouse is where you
127920	find one of the coolest things so this
129389	thousand Hertz ultra pulling Mouse 5600
131489	DPI sensor etc
133350	etc but check this out you can actually
135450	adjust the click force required for the
140730	top two buttons here the left and the
142320	right click so there's three settings
143730	low medium and high and I think all
146400	three of us in the room found the high
148080	setting to be a little bit on the high
149670	side but oh okay slick is saying no he
152520	did not so it was just me and diesel who
154680	found the high setting a little bit high
156030	but this goes to show you how it might
158040	be useful to be able to adjust how much
161370	force is required for your clicks cuz I
163200	found mice that I like except that I'm
165870	like oh this one's basically got a hair
167850	trigger on it and I am NOT able to use
169920	it versus ones that I'm like oh this is
171990	like way too heavy and I can't really
173220	use it so there you have it moving on to
176100	the Banshee headset this is a USB
178950	headset so it does not have an analogue
180990	option part of the reason for that is
183000	because it has the lighting scheme built
185550	on to it it needs to be powered in order
188010	to function correctly so there we go I'm
189480	gonna go ahead and plug this in and hope
191820	that it's gone and lit it so ah yes
194070	there we go that looks nice Starcraft 2
196560	logos on both sides as well as lighting
199260	on the bottom of the unit and on the
202200	sides and so front and back bottom and
204690	sides looks very good it's a circumaural
207120	fairly open design so I can hear quite
209700	clearly even once I have them on and it
211710	sits over top of my ear so I'm gonna try
214140	and give our close-up camera a good look
215760	at how large those pads are fairly soft
219480	fairly plush but they do rebound quite
222300	quickly so I'd expect them to need a bit
224160	of a break-in period before they start
225870	to get really comfortable however this
228000	is good news for comfort the headband is
230160	extremely wide so I'll pull out my
232020	trademark iPhone comparison it's almost
234540	the width of an iPhone and sits on your
237330	head with that entire surface down there
239850	with a nice plush pad on it so that's
242340	gonna make this very comfortable the
244230	weight I'd say is sort of average it's
246240	not super lightweight but the fact that
247890	it's really well supported like that
249270	means it shouldn't fatigue you too much
250980	over time the buttons available on the
253050	back are for your microphone which is
255630	detachable by the way yeah there you go
258149	you can take the microphone off put it
259350	back on if you want especially if you're
260910	not looking at it this will be okay you
262950	know what it's off for now okay so you
264510	can adjust the volume and mute on your
266610	microphone as
267660	well as the volume and mute on the
269760	headset itself which is just kind of
271770	nice to have back there and you can
273030	easily touch them and feel what you're
275430	trying to do so thank you for checking
276930	out there's mass unboxing here I'll just
279450	put this down next to the other one so
280830	you can get a nice little shot of what
282690	they all look like in the dark remember
284310	guys you can change the color scheme to
285960	whatever you want and I'm just gonna cut
287430	across that camera so hopefully
288870	whoever's editing this it's gonna see
290790	that there we go
292080	so that is what they look like all
294090	together and you can make them all the
295260	same color within Razer synapse 2.0
297300	which is their software that allows you
298980	to set up profiles for your devices and
300960	then as long as you log into synapse 2.0
303300	it can take all your profiles with you
305280	wherever you happen to be thank you for
