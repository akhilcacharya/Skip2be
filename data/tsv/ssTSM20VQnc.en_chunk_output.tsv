960	[Music]
6649	welcome to a much demanded unboxing this
9750	is the Corsair Vengeance k60 so yes
13139	Corsair finally has pretty much a full
15599	set of peripherals they've got your
16770	speakers your headphones
18150	your keyboards and your mice actually I
20340	have a mouse here too but we're not
22560	doing that one just yet so we're going
24900	to show the keyboard so Corsair is all
26970	about gaming we've known this from
28800	pretty much day one when when it was
31920	just memory and then oh I know I'm gonna
36660	get it wrong when I try and tell you
38460	guys it's sort of the order of the
40020	categories they expend it into but power
42690	supply and then cases and then cooling
46950	and then audio I'm probably missing
51510	something Corsair does so many things
54149	these days but what is most exceptional
57059	about Corsair in my opinion is the fact
59370	that they do pretty much everything well
61320	I can't think of very many course or
63690	products that have had the opportunity
65369	to play around with or to check out that
68189	I haven't been really impressed by so
69990	let's go over what are the overall specs
72390	of this keyboard first so this is a
74729	mechanical keyboard yes pretty much any
77070	serious gamer or serious typist and
79409	they're gonna tell you mechanical key
80729	switches are pretty much a must on any
83640	high-end keyboard so these are using
85200	cherry MX red mechanical key switches
87150	really which which mechanical key
90000	switches feel good to you comes down to
91560	the personal preference of the typist
93570	themselves soms are louder and some are
95909	less loud than others some have sort of
98100	a longer travel time to register the
100259	keystrokes jump some have the shorter
101610	travel time Corsair believes that the
103680	red key switches are ideal for gaming so
106350	that's why they've used those for this
107670	particular keyboard this one this is
110670	more of the FPS version of this keyboard
112890	comes with contoured textured WASD key
115259	cap so you can see those right here I'll
116610	show you those once we open it up full
118619	key matrix anti-ghosting so
120149	anti-ghosting means that no matter what
122850	combination of easy press you're not
125189	going to get any accidental unintended
129380	keystrokes registered this can happen
131810	with less premium keyboards and what
136190	what it tends to occur is while you are
139190	typing quickly and you press two or
141770	three keyboards together while you're
143600	while you're going while you're in the
145160	middle of something it'll actually
146360	register an extra keystroke because of
149570	the way that the keyboard is
150890	communicating via USB to the computer
153080	itself so they've implemented
155150	anti-ghosting as well as twenty key
158300	rollover so you hear a lot of talk about
160340	how many key rollover so what does that
162800	mean we've seen up to n key rollover on
165800	ps2 keyboards and Corsair says they
167960	could actually implement and he roll
169820	over with USB on this particular
172940	keyboard which is a very neat feature
174640	however they went with 20 because the
177470	reality of it is unless you're operating
179390	your keyboard like with your arm and
180980	your face you're probably not gonna
182660	press more than 20 keys at a time so
184760	what that rollover spec means is how
187010	many keys you can hold down come on
190880	let's see how many I suppress at a given
193040	time before they will stop registering
198020	each new one that you press down so for
201350	gamers it's fairly common to be holding
203330	down shift and tab and jumping and I
206720	don't know maybe you're playing like an
208100	older style game and maybe you're
209330	actually using these for you know your
211580	jump in your pouch or something and then
213410	this is you're moving around maybe
214370	you're playing a 2d side-scroller it's
215990	fairly common for a gamer to hold down
217670	eight or more keys at a time whereas the
220250	normal the normal roll over for like
223340	cheaper keyboards does not allow you to
225560	necessarily have every one of those
227480	keystrokes be registered so that's why
229190	that's an important feature what else we
231110	got here so the contoured textured WASD
233180	key caps I'll show you those in a minute
234470	they're right here I haven't forgotten
236180	bulky matrix uhm anti-ghosting yeah
239120	multiple key presses won't jam you up
240980	let's every keystroke get through
242510	professional-grade brushed aluminum
243890	chassis with laser etched keys love that
245630	I'll show you guys that closely soft
247910	cushioned contoured wrist rest and I'll
249590	show you that in a minute as well I just
251360	want to make sure that I do not forget
253610	anything here because this is a keyboard
256279	that a lot of people
259108	requested that I take a look at so I
260879	don't want to miss anything so here is
263310	the wrist rest so what makes this the
265560	more FPS oriented product versus the k9t
268500	which is more of the MMO oriented
271710	product and I will show you guys what
273270	makes it that this guy is all about
276060	comfort when you're using your left hand
278250	to game which here we go is facilitated
286860	by things like this wrist rest guy right
289650	here which I'm just going to try to
291930	figure out how to put back together
293279	because I actually do not know okay and
302759	this guy goes under here so it's got a
305009	bit actually I'll show you this first so
306240	it's got like a soft kind of rubberized
307919	feely thing here with see this little
311520	dimply surface I guess that's to help
313289	keep a sweat from accumulating and
315419	making the surface slippery which is
316770	kind of nice this parts hard plastic as
318930	well as this part right here this serves
320580	as a carrying case for the keys that you
322949	are not using at any given time and then
324990	there are latches right on the bottom
326669	here I'll show you those once I've got
327870	it attached here that allow you to put
330089	this right here so that your hand rests
332159	comfortably right here for gaming the
334169	MMO version of the keyboard has a bunch
335940	of buttons over here which the FPS
337289	version doesn't have and the MMO version
339240	doesn't come with this rest which is
341639	designed especially for FPS gamers whose
343919	Mouse hands are over here and whose
346080	keyboard hands sit right here
348120	it can be quite easily attached and
349740	detached so you just pull it off like
352229	that and then I'm just gonna show you
353789	guys the spot on the bottom where it
356580	goes just like that while I'm on the
359250	bottom here I'll show you guys what
360360	you've got in terms of adjustable feet
362610	for your comfort so you can raise up
364469	your keyboard a little bit you can slant
366360	your keyboard this way if you want you
368370	can slant your keyboard this way if you
371729	want and if you're not using any of the
373319	feet you've got four rubber feet here as
375330	well as two rubber feet here to keep the
377430	keyboard from slipping around although
378839	it's quite heavy so I don't think you're
380430	gonna have too many problems with it
382199	moving around uh ninten
383460	chili comes with a two-year warranty I
385440	just want to show you guys the included
388550	connectors so we've got the keyboard USB
390840	as well as the built-in hub USB so the
396599	hub has your thumb looks like it's just
400169	the one okay so that's where you plug in
402090	your mouse
403370	alright so let's uh yeah let's have a
406470	look at these keys here so what you want
408150	to do is you take your included key
410009	remover which was in here I don't know
411900	if you guys let me take that out and you
413520	just pull off the cue like this you can
415110	clearly see the cherry red switches so
417720	named for their red color alright and
421199	then you just go ahead and take your
423139	contoured rubberized keys and you
426180	replace your WASD now check this out
428310	this is what they mean by contoured each
432030	one of these keys is actually oh shoot I
434460	just installed that one upside down
435919	that's the thing about s is it's hard to
438599	tell which way it is intended to be
440699	oriented so there you go put those on
443310	like that so now you can very easily
445380	feel without looking can you see from
447389	that angle how these are actually curved
450180	towards the center there you go yeah now
452250	you can see that so these are contoured
454229	so you can very easily feel which are
456120	your WASD keys and which ones are not
458639	and the same goes actually for the
461250	number keys up here you can see that one
463919	is actually curved the opposite way from
467250	6 so this could actually be very useful
469889	for MMO gamers as well so when you're
471509	looking for that particular potion you
473699	can easily feel up here okay which one
476820	is it okay that's too far that's my
479219	number 6 belt spot or whatever the case
480930	may be so that's kind of a neat feature
483770	let's have a look at the overall layout
485849	they haven't done anything that I would
488340	consider to be a cardinal sin here long
490979	shift keys long backspace key and
493680	full-size Enter key I am just you know
497400	it kills me to see otherwise
499020	awesome keyboards like say for example
501150	the 7g with something like a short
503099	backspace key great for gaming not ideal
506250	for typists who have small hands like
508560	myself because I can barely reach this I
512099	definitely can't reach that while
514198	keeping my fingers on the keys now
515880	something a lot of people have
517470	sort of made I think an inordinate
519750	amount of fuss about with this keyboard
521429	is the fact that is not fully mechanical
523470	that's right
524550	so these keys this whole block is
527580	mechanical
528390	these ones are mechanical that means
530520	they use the Cherry MX switches so those
532620	are the expensive type switches and the
535020	number keys are all mechanical however
537150	the F keys as well as these keys are non
541080	mechanical now one thing I would like to
543150	see Corsair change around if they ever
544860	do a rev two is I would like to see the
546960	Delete key and the escapees be
548850	mechanical but honestly for all this
550770	stuff up here and the insert homepage up
552720	it doesn't make that much of a
553860	difference you know you can actually
555060	hear the difference in mechanical keys
556740	so check this out I'm hitting those with
562800	exactly the same force this gives me a
564810	much more sort of satisfying response
567170	versus something like that it feels more
569460	spongy that's because it's not a
570990	mechanical key switch so up here we've
573420	got a Windows key lock we've also got
575370	our number caps and scroll lock
577350	indicator LEDs we've got media functions
579570	so we've got stop back play pause as
581910	well as forward there's your volume
583650	wheel I love the way they've implemented
585000	this it's very very nice to to touch as
587700	well as a mute key um you know what
592050	we're not going to be able to do this
593370	video without plugging this thing in
594690	because it has an awesome blue LED
596370	backlight which looks fantastic off of
598800	the brushed aluminum base so what
600210	Corsairs done here as you can see the
602160	entire keyboard is going to be super
604260	easy to clean you just use a can of dust
606150	off because instead of leaving little
608640	recesses actually I'm gonna pull up my
610380	my 7g here again to show you guys
613020	instead of having all these little
615090	recesses in here that you can't clean
617550	things out of very easily Corsair has
619680	given you full access to the entire
622230	inner workings of the keyboard you can
624270	actually pull almost every key off and
626330	easily get any sort of dust or hair or
629790	anything that accumulates in it out of
631620	it that's kind of neat as well it also
633210	gives it kind of a really cool look I
635280	love the brushed aluminum finish hair if
636750	you have a good look at that yep you
638580	have okay good let's see if I've missed
640380	anything else in terms of spec gaming
643350	rust with soft touch surface tin user
645420	installable sculpted FPS keys so yeah
647580	that included WASD as well
649540	the one two six numbers and don't forget
652690	you can store all of those keys inside
654730	this handy rest little labeled spots as
657610	well as your spot for the Installer and
660250	uninstaller windows lock Cherry MX if
664540	you're interested in the specs of the
666130	Cherry MX red mechanical key switches
667720	there you go they do have gold contacts
669310	and they're rated for 50 million
670660	operations so yes this keyboard will
673300	last you a very very very long time so
676120	let's go ahead and drag it over to the
677890	computer so that I can plug it into a
679720	USB port and show you guys how wicked
681910	this thing looks when you actually plug
683500	it in so it looks like I was mistaken
685630	the k60 does not have the backlight the
687970	k9d does the only one I've actually used
690010	so far as the king 90 so yeah I've sort
693640	of misremembered which one had which but
695920	either way I think that pretty much
697270	concludes it I think we're done with the
698710	K 60 here thank you for checking out my
700840	unboxing your first look at the Corsair
702640	Vengeance k 60 FPS gaming keyboard don't
705460	forget to subscribe to - tech tips for
706960	more boxing's reviews and other computer
708460	videos and now that I've actually used
710290	both of them I would have to say that if
711910	it came down to it I would probably
713770	choose the K 90 with the backlight rims
717220	with the backlight as well as the
719500	additional programmable buttons on the
721810	left hand side versus the K 60 even
725200	though the K 60 is less expensive
726640	they'll both provide a very good typing
729070	experience they've both got the laser
730660	etched keys which are never going to
732460	wear out no matter what because those
734650	letters are etched right into the key
736750	caps themselves rather than being
738520	something that can be worn off actually
740320	a perfect example is if you check out
742600	this 7 G over here here where you can
750190	clearly see which keys get used a lot
753580	more or less than the other ones yeah
754930	that's pretty obvious so you can see all
756580	of the numbered keys are much less
758110	bright than this SteelSeries logo right
760270	here so don't forget to subscribe to
