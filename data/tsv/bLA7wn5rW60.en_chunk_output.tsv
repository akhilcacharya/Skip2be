30	if I asked you to imagine the perfect
2100	gaming keyboard you'd probably think of
4440	things like Cherry MX which is
6629	programmable keys and n key rollover but
10740	what if there was a keyboard that had
12480	all the basic gamer features but also
15780	helped you play longer without fatigue
18330	and even gave you multiple ways to
20850	configure your desktop maybe that's
23369	something you didn't even know you
25260	wanted introducing the freestyle edge
28830	from Kinesis gaming the world's first
31920	split gaming keyboard and introducing
36290	Corsairs new light loop fans featuring
39300	16 independent LEDs in every fan and low
43890	noise operation without sacrificing
45809	performance check them out at the link
47730	below
49370	[Music]
56490	now the ideal keyboard position can
59380	change a lot depending on what game
61570	you're playing so the idea here is that
64089	whether you're the type who likes to
65979	tilt your keyboard for shooters throw in
68350	a joystick for flying bring the mouse in
70450	close for reduced shoulder fatigue or
72369	let's be honest sometimes you just want
74500	a little snacky poop the edge gives you
76930	flexibility so the two halves of the
79780	keyboard can be placed up to 50
82150	centimeters apart and you can even hide
84790	some though not quite enough in my
87460	opinion of the chord that goes between
89649	the pieces to limit the amount of excess
92470	hanging out in closer configurations now
95680	I know what you're thinking okay maybe
98200	that's useful but is this really worth a
101710	video to be honest initially we thought
104289	it was just a keyboard with a flashy
106720	gimmick too but it ended up being a damn
109420	good keyboard the build quality is solid
112690	with braided cables and Cherry MX
114700	switches either in red brown or blue
117610	flavors and features like 1 millisecond
120220	response times anti-ghosting and 8
123030	programmable macro keys will keep
125049	hardcore players competitive but
127270	stealthy the matte black finish and easy
129940	to read legend contribute to a clean
131830	modern look that doesn't scream gamer
135040	I mean who says that SiC gear bro has to
138730	actually physically nause at you and it
141340	even has a pitch-black mode that turns
143980	off both the blue backlight and the
146380	indicator LEDs neato so at this point
148840	even if the video was over that no no
151900	wait I said if it's not over yet the
154750	edge would be worth a serious look but
157150	we haven't even talked about the feature
159190	that takes this keyboard to the next
160989	level programmability every one of the
164200	edges 95 keys can be remapped to not
167590	just any function but any two functions
170560	which you toggle between using the
172989	freaking key down here and I'm not
176019	talking about simple functions every key
178870	or combo using modifiers like ctrl + or
182799	shift can be mapped to a macro and you
185770	can have up to 24 macros
188420	each one can be up to 300 characters
190430	long the execution speed for which can
192950	be controlled globally or set
194959	individually all the way from four to a
197989	fiery 3,000 actions per second been man
202280	this thing just keeps going let's say
203870	that you share your keyboard with
205220	someone else or you like different key
207530	mappings for different activities like
209180	gaming or working that's no problem you
212660	can have this level of customization on
214910	up to nine different layouts so such
218420	advanced program ability probably needs
220519	advanced programming knowledge and/or a
223250	software tool then right well you can do
226910	either of those things what's cool is
228680	that the software tool for Windows is
230630	actually built right into the keyboard
232459	no download required but all but a few
235400	nice actions can actually be done just
238040	using the keys on the board it's super
240890	intuitive and only takes a second and if
242930	you ever forget what layer you're using
244760	or just what you even have programmed
247850	you can check it at any time and all of
250970	this is stored directly on the board so
253040	you can take all of your settings with
254750	you which brings us to the bad stuff you
258500	may have noticed that I haven't talked
260120	about price yet this keyboard is two
262580	hundred and twenty dollars or two
264770	hundred on Amazon which isn't outlandish
267710	but it is a lot even for a high quality
270100	mechanical board especially one that
272870	isn't RGB that price tag on its own
276680	isn't all of what bothers me anyway
279710	remember that's still only half the
281600	price of the last Kinesis ergonomic
283640	keyboard we reviewed the advantage to
285650	which you can check out here it's the
288169	fact that once you've taken your
289810	expensive product out of its clever box
292490	you're left feeling a little incomplete
296260	the reason is that the edge doesn't come
299419	with the lift kit which after using it
302000	both with and without it feels
304570	completely essential it tilts your
307700	wrists 5 10 or 15 degrees and takes the
312260	edge from being a stylish flexible maybe
315080	even fantastic gaming keyboard to being
317630	perhaps the most ergonomic
319460	Gaming keyboard out there since the
321680	wrist rests keep your wrist from
323120	extending the lift kit keeps your arms
325490	from pronating and the separation
327740	prevents them ona's from deviating
330020	whether you're typing for hours gaming
332750	for hours or some combination of the two
335509	for hours so should you buy it not
338690	everyone is going to like the cramped
340430	arrow keys or the fact that the halves
342590	don't snap together for some reason and
344840	at this price we think it absolutely
347470	needs to include lift kit but of all the
351530	ergonomic keyboards so far we think this
354680	one has by far the most mainstream
357080	appeal so if it goes on sale I'm ready
360199	to say pull the trigger now but until
362660	then you might say I'm a little bit
366620	split but torn uh anyway what I'm not
372289	torn about is telling you guys about
