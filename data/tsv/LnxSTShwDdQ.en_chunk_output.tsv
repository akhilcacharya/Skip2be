0	it keeps getting stranger and stranger
1979	around here when it comes to keyboards
4080	the advantage to was kind of like a
6089	gateway drug with its key Wells and
8790	thumb clusters then came the safe type
11730	keyboard with its freak'n rearview
13349	mirrors as for today well we're clearly
17850	screaming down this slippery slope at an
20189	ass waxing rate because we've arrived at
22529	the or B touch a keyless keyboard and it
26400	also works as a mouse some how what how
31890	even do
33750	[Music]
39290	the Corsair one features a compact form
42480	factor that is fast quiet and you
44970	guessed it compact check it out through
47280	Amazon or Newegg at the links below okay
50550	so like the other economic keyboards
52980	that we've checked out the or B touch
54600	takes two hands to operate but not this
58739	time because the letters are physically
60809	separated this time it's because both
63660	hands are actually required to register
66690	a single keystroke so to type a letter
70710	then you need to coordinate the movement
73410	of these two domes in a process called
77030	cording the dome on the Left points at
80430	one of eight symbol clusters while the
82860	dome on the right is used to specify the
85560	particular character you want to type
87420	based on its position within the cluster
89930	the end result then is that each letter
93030	basically has its own Associated gesture
96240	and unlike a regular keyboard where some
99149	letters like Zed and P are more
101940	difficult to strike than others on the
103890	or B touch all the gestures are equally
106380	easy to perform though with that said
109200	some are more difficult to memorize than
111659	others more on that later
113159	now I want to talk about what it's like
115229	to actually type on this thing
117320	surprisingly it's actually kind of fun
119850	according to or B touch most users can
122909	type at 60% of their QWERTY typing speed
125520	after about five hours of practice and
127560	believe it or not I believe it no of
131008	course at first you have to stare down
135510	at the keyboard to do anything at all
138239	and it feels like it takes days to
141269	string together a single bloody sentence
143239	but even within just a couple hours of
146790	practice
147390	James had most of the letter gestures
149579	memorized and when he was telling me
152370	about it I got kind of this weird vibe
154640	apparently that feel when you finally
157350	write a word with complete fluidity is
159420	like totally a huge rush whatever floats
163650	your boat dude then though once you
165840	really get the hang of it you can start
167639	to do some serious power moves because
169470	get this one after typing a letter you
172650	we need to return one of the domes to
175319	Center before typing the next one that
178019	means that if consecutive letters share
181260	the same cluster or color then you can
184709	bang them out by moving just one hand
186900	it's again I'm going from someone else's
190049	breathless account here about as
192569	exhilarating as stringing together a
194310	fatal combo and Mortal Kombat but much
197099	more productive on the subject of Mortal
199620	Kombat according to or B touches
201359	unmanned yule because the or B touch
204359	performs all the functions of a keyboard
206430	and mouse it can be used to play games
208849	well how about that
211290	let's try it out shall we okay then
214440	first we slide down twice to enter mouse
217859	mode now we use the right dome to
220560	control the mouse and the left dome to
222750	click all right now we switch back to
225180	type mode so we can reload and try
227340	walking around it hmm we're not moving
230250	and there's no way to actually hold a
233099	key down so I can't actually walk
235620	anywhere and even if I could I wouldn't
237720	be able to aim at the same time so okay
241400	you can't win them all let's get back to
244230	typing this is pretty cool even though
246780	it only has two moving parts you can
249150	still do advanced commands like Control
252120	Alt Delete and highlighting an entire
254340	row of text using the shift and end keys
256430	albeit at a much slower pace
258510	all right then Linus an else enough if
261570	it's so limited and slow who's gonna buy
264630	this thing ah
265860	I'm glad you asked like our other our go
269010	keyboards the or B touches design does
271500	eliminate the three musketeers of
273479	repetitive stress injuries pronation
275930	extension and ulnar deviation unlike
280020	them however it's really made for folks
282630	with hand or arm prosthesis arthritis
285570	spinal injuries cerebral palsy and other
288659	finger dexterity impairments it's also
291479	been found to be really appealing to
293310	people with autism because instead of
295289	being laid out randomly the letters and
297449	colors are both arranged in a logical
299430	way according to this chart many autists
301979	can actually type faster using the or B
304050	touch than they can with a QWERTY board
306400	which doesn't mean we don't have some
308290	constructive criticism
309520	it definitely slides around on the desk
311860	too much during use
313300	it's build quality is unexceptional
315820	given the $400 price we think the num
318850	lock mode while well-intentioned is
321160	pretty difficult to use flying blind
323800	with no backspace and while there are
327010	gestures for arrow keys we really think
329800	a dedicated d-pad would make navigation
332020	easier in many cases and possibly make
335530	gaming slightly less poisonous with that
338919	said though we still think the RB touch
340600	is a homerun it's surprisingly easy to
343120	learn our only comfort related grievance
346000	is related to palm sweat after extended
348400	use and they will even make you a
350650	left-handed version or adjust the
352539	actuation force according to your
354220	particular needs plus it comes in a tube
357070	filled with rubber duckies I'm touched
