15509	many
15960	different
16379	configurations
17340	of
17460	the
17609	keyboards
18090	they
18240	let
18390	you
18480	have
18660	pretty
19020	much
19109	whatever
19800	you
20010	could
20369	possibly
21090	want
21420	in
21689	terms
22410	of
22740	the
23130	layout
23310	so
23640	you
23670	can
23880	have
24060	you
24449	can
24480	have
24689	different
25109	layouts
25470	different
26010	sizes
26820	different
27330	switches
28170	under
28470	them
28680	you
28859	can
29039	have
29279	different
30150	color
30480	schemes
30900	of
31080	the
31170	keyboards
31619	we've
31800	unboxed
32189	the
32250	camel
32700	one
32880	before
33210	which
33329	is
33450	pretty
33630	cool
34530	this
34860	particular
35399	one
35520	has
35730	a
35760	black
36000	body
36270	cover
36510	with
36719	a
36750	104
37590	key
37800	arrangement
38219	so
38550	it
38670	doesn't
39000	have
39090	the
39239	missing
39540	number
39780	pad
39960	it
40530	has
40890	carry
41550	MX
42090	red
42570	switches
43230	which
43710	are
43860	basically
44340	like
44850	a
45059	softer
45870	version
46110	of
46530	the
47309	black
47730	switch
48210	so
48510	that
48780	is
48960	to
49110	say
49289	that
49559	it's
49890	very
49980	linear
50520	in
50820	terms
51059	of
51239	the
51329	travel
51690	there
52050	isn't
52350	like
52500	a
53090	resistance
54090	and
54239	then
54329	a
54360	click
54660	and
54840	then
55170	a
55199	release
55530	it's
56250	very
56460	linear
56670	and
57000	it
57120	requires
57449	less
57809	force
58170	to
58440	depress
58859	then
59550	a
59879	black
60780	switch
61170	which
61410	isn't
61590	to
61800	say
62039	that
62309	it
62730	has
62910	like
63270	a
63300	neurological
64049	disorder
64500	that
64530	causes
64830	it
65099	to
65159	be
65309	sad
65670	that
66270	is
66450	to
66630	just
66900	say
67110	that
68750	it
69750	is
69960	being
70200	pressed
70710	down
71420	depressed
72420	not
72780	like
73110	you
73950	know
75229	like
76229	it
76409	needs
76790	you
77790	know
77820	help
78119	from
79080	somebody
79320	to
80009	become
80159	undepressed
81060	although
81420	actually
82290	no
82470	because
82650	it
82920	doesn't
82950	need
83460	help
83610	to
83820	get
83939	I'm
84420	the
84750	one
84900	making
85320	it
85409	depressed
85830	and
86130	then
86670	if
86790	I
86909	would
87090	just
87330	stop
87840	putting
88170	so
88439	much
88619	pressure
89040	on
89280	it
89610	then
90240	it
90360	would
90450	be
90570	undepressed
91049	I
92119	don't
93119	know
93180	where
93299	I
93360	was
93420	gonna
93630	think
93840	that's
94049	okay
94320	so
94770	let's
94979	have
95070	a
95189	look
95400	at
95640	the
95759	keyboard
96150	itself
96689	Philco
97380	is
97619	a
98100	world
98820	renowned
99360	brand
99869	they're
100619	a
100650	Japanese
101220	brand
101750	pretty
102750	much
102960	if
103200	you're
103350	into
103710	keyboards
104310	and
104610	more
105240	people
105390	are
105600	into
105780	keyboards
106170	than
106320	you
106439	would
106560	think
106799	you
107040	have
107610	heard
107909	of
108119	Phil
108720	Coke
108960	you
109380	are
109560	familiar
109770	with
110040	Phil
110369	Coke
110610	and
110820	you
111270	probably
111600	want
112170	a
112470	Philco
112979	keyboard
113430	in
113640	some
114240	shape
114780	or
114810	form
115530	so
115829	they
116579	are
116729	known
117030	for
117509	their
117630	build
117899	quality
118399	very
119399	very
119850	solid
120180	keyboards
120780	it's
120930	not
121079	quite
121469	a
121500	model
121920	M
122070	but
122340	then
122520	again
122610	nothing
123119	is
123530	what
124530	can
124680	I
124710	say
124950	right
125030	however
126030	as
126360	far
126689	as
126869	modern
127350	keyboards
127829	go
128068	you
128310	aren't
128610	going
128848	to
129000	do
129209	any
129538	better
129989	than
130229	this
130410	there's
130709	absolutely
131340	no
131910	flex
132330	to
132569	the
132690	deck
133090	self
133330	there
133930	is
134110	that
134830	weight
135250	to
135280	it
135610	like
135849	it's
136030	not
136209	you
136720	know
136810	once
137019	again
137260	it's
137379	not
137410	a
137530	model
137800	and
138099	like
138280	you
138400	probably
138580	couldn't
138940	kill
139209	a
139239	man
139480	with
139720	it
139900	but
140230	you
140349	could
140530	stun
140950	it
141120	you
142120	know
142260	like
143260	if
143379	someone
143650	broke
143800	into
144040	your
144190	like
144489	you're
144640	gaming
144879	dead
145300	and
145510	you're
145629	all
145750	like
145959	oh
146200	yeah
147430	you
147640	know
147760	no
148090	like
148360	ax
148629	is
148900	nearby
149260	have
149830	your
149980	keyboard
150160	be
150430	like
150580	what
150879	pow
151120	and
151660	then
151810	hopefully
152319	you
152470	wouldn't
152769	wreck
152980	the
153160	USB
153610	port
153910	because
154569	this
155049	keyboard
155319	does
155860	plug
156280	into
156459	your
156610	computer
156730	by
157150	USB
157330	or
158140	ps2
158739	with
159040	the
159160	adapter
159760	it
160660	features
161080	NQ
161470	rollover
161890	which
162040	means
162220	you
162340	can
162459	press
162640	as
162790	many
162970	things
163269	as
163390	you
163450	want
163569	without
164170	running
164500	into
164709	any
164890	difficulty
165670	with
165880	you
166150	know
166239	random
166750	ghosting
167739	and
168069	you
168190	know
168310	if
168459	you
168640	learn
169239	to
169269	type
169630	with
169840	your
169870	face
170319	then
170799	you
171280	could
171519	type
171700	with
171910	your
172060	face
172299	and
172329	that
172660	would
172810	be
173130	really
174130	weird
174340	looking
174760	but
174940	like
175180	probably
175690	effective
176140	in
176920	terms
177220	of
177370	the
177459	layout
177760	I
178170	love
179170	it
179440	because
179829	I'm
180280	one
180459	of
180579	those
180700	guys
180879	who
181209	wants
181450	to
181569	see
181720	long
181959	shifts
182349	enters
182739	and
183040	backspace
183760	keys
184090	because
184420	I
184450	have
184629	small
184840	hands
185079	and
185170	I
185260	can't
185530	reach
185890	a
186040	backspace
186459	key
186670	over
186849	here
187000	without
187120	moving
187450	my
187780	index
188079	finger
188379	off
188530	of
188680	the
188799	J
189010	which
189519	means
189760	that
189970	I'll
190090	get
190239	lost
190450	when
190750	I
190810	go
190930	back
191110	and
191170	then
191709	it'll
191829	be
191950	a
192040	total
192340	disaster
192610	and
193180	I
193209	don't
193269	know
193480	what
193629	to
193750	do
193930	um
194280	note

202269	this
202510	isn't
202810	I
202989	guess
203200	not
203500	a
203739	more
203920	gaming
