30	right here this is the intended usage
3179	model of this product this is the
4950	Phantom lap board I'm sitting on a couch
6750	and I have the Phantom lap board where
9540	it belongs on my lap so it is no longer
12300	a phantom although it does say phantom
14219	on the box because it finally exists
16859	it's finally released I have a physical
19050	lap board now we've been talking about
20789	this product for ages but here it is so
23580	this is a wireless laser mouse and
26099	keyboard combo with a built-in sort of
29670	mouse pad surface the keyboard swivels
31800	around it's got all these great features
33120	but I think probably the best thing to
35100	do is take a quick look at the box here
37649	and then get it open so we can have a
39180	look at it
39780	so here we've got the package contents
41489	which I'm sure you're fully capable of
43500	reading on the back we've got some
45510	outlines of the media functions that it
48480	has so it has 13 media keys 10 of which
50820	are like FN something else keys so
54629	they've got the blue text on them and
56340	then three dedicated media keys here
58680	we've got another general outline of the
60690	overall specs so remember this is will
63239	not remember I haven't said it yet but
64860	the intended use of this keyboard is
66540	from the couch so they want you to be
69330	able to game operate the Internet do
72119	whatever it is you do on a computer with
74310	your media PC from the comfort of the
77670	couch so we've had we actually had a
80280	look at the vision tech candy board
82110	recently and my overall impressions of
84570	that was this is pretty cool but if I
88049	were actually gonna like sit on sit on
90329	the couch and browse the Internet it
92400	wouldn't really be suitable so this is
96450	meant to be the dip sort of in-between
98430	having a dedicated keyboard device that
101790	has handheld and using like a regular
104159	keyboard and mouse and operating the
105960	mouse on the couch beside you so here
108030	let's have let's have a look at the
109110	laser mouse what the cameraman was
110310	trying to do so we've got a glossy white
112140	finish on here there's a black version
114329	as well we've got a scroll wheel two
116310	buttons no back and forward buttons I
118619	wouldn't have minded seeing that but
119939	maybe in red 2 on the bottom we've got a
122159	power on and power off switch as well as
125130	a battery
127860	oh I'm not sure how that works hold on
130530	there's probably a way to do this that's
134220	cleverer than I am I bet you push this
137340	in and then slide it or something okay
139680	well we'll figure out the battery later
140820	there's a binding key and that's about
143130	it you can see the laser sensors right
144720	there so there's the mouse and then the
146910	keyboard this is the really innovative
148920	piece because the reality of it is you
152060	could kind of use it with any wireless
154860	mouse that you so desire because yeah
158459	I'm gonna go ahead and move the box they
160380	both operate with double-a batteries and
162630	they estimate about a four month life
164459	time for the batteries here is how it
166950	works I actually don't know how it works
168870	yet but okay there we go so the lab
172440	board actually sits like this and then
176310	if you're left-handed you can operate
177959	the mouse on this surface right here so
180360	I'm gonna go ahead and put it down the
182130	way that it's intended to be used so if
184080	I'm left-handed it works like this but
186360	get it get this wait there's more
188220	there's more okay so you actually can
190320	take the lap board and turn it at any
192870	angle you like including all the way the
196380	other way around so now you can hold it
198840	like this so you can type which is
200670	actually reasonably comfortable and the
202590	keys feel all right
203430	I really like the keyboard layout on
205140	this thing I cheated a little bit before
206459	I did the unboxing but they haven't done
208440	anything stupid everyone always does
210959	something stupid on a keyboard it's like
213209	this keyboard would be great except it's
214709	got a short backspace or this keyboard
216660	would be great except it has a short
218100	Shift key
218670	this keyboard is just great it's compact
221310	it has all the keys that you really need
223680	including dedicated arrow keys yes thank
226410	you it's designed for internet browsing
228600	you've got home and page up page down
230840	dedicated keys so it's got everything
233310	you need to comfortably browse the
234989	Internet the tactile response is
237150	reasonably good you got long shift keys
239130	that are exactly where they belong long
241230	backspace key long Enter key I mean they
243299	got everything right I don't think I've
245370	seen a keyboard that's gotten everything
247440	right in terms of the standard layout
249180	and I mean that's the funny thing is
250530	standard layout it's supposed to be
252299	standard it's supposed to be easy anyway
254489	here's your media keys so I'm not sure
256769	exactly what all of these do although I
258660	can cheat a little bit
259910	and I can pull up the box and we can
261380	find out so f1 is gonna launch Media
263870	Center okay that's pretty cool F 2
266180	launches my music and then my photos my
268130	videos my TV you can playback a DVD with
271010	a dedicated media key so it's all about
273140	media and games so this laser mouse
276650	phantom is saying is perfectly capable
278300	of gaming you can see the mousing
279800	surface the usable size of it is
281720	actually quite large like I can go all
283820	the way up and down here I can go all
285920	the way side to side until my knuckle
287510	brushes the bottom of the lap board and
289130	you can see they haven't cheaped out on
290720	the surface so even though the edge you
293210	can see the edge of the mousing surface
294560	is here they've used the same material
296510	here so you can actually cheat a little
298370	bit if you want to go over a bit further
299870	mind you I guess I've run into that USB
302090	dongle pretty close unless you're really
304430	kind of creative about it so there's the
307070	USB dongle that's also included so
309320	that's a 2.4 gigahertz so you can see
311600	it's a phantom model from you thousand
314060	that's pretty cool plug that into your
316010	computer and then press presumably the
317960	bind key on the mouse and then I don't
320000	know if there's a bind key on the
321200	keyboard we haven't flipped it over yet
322610	so here on the bottom okay this isn't he
324440	so you've got two rubber bars all along
327830	the bottom of the phantom lap board so
329630	that's gonna keep it in place while
330950	you're frantically gaming or less
332750	frantically doing something else you can
334220	see it's actually quite difficult to
335960	slip you can't see that but I'm telling
337400	you that it's actually quite difficult
338930	to move it around once it's positioned
340880	on your lap now the overall feel of the
343310	keyboard is it does have a little bit of
345110	flex you're not gonna get around that I
346880	mean you they're creating a hinge device
348980	that is basically you know just using an
352310	arm down here to support the whole
353990	keyboard but as long as you're not
355370	mashing on your keyboard you're gonna be
357530	able to use it quite comfortably okay so
360650	you can see once I put a little bit of
362120	weight on it and I start typing it
364100	doesn't actually move much even when I'm
366200	depressing the keys so it does not
368030	interfere with the typing process and
369980	off use this and let's have a look at
372590	the mechanism itself so I mean that's
376100	gonna sort of be a make-or-break point
377750	for something like this so I don't know
380090	how oh oh there we go
381320	oh okay I get it so this piece right
383630	here when you lift it up see that lock
387230	in place so then to lower the lap board
389900	you just pull no push it in
392920	lower it down and then you can use the
394960	lap board without the mouse should you
398050	so desire and then this I don't know
400960	what this piece does but okay here let's
402520	lift it up again so it only has one
403780	setting which honestly I don't think
406660	that's really very bothersome but maybe
408520	some people wouldn't like that it's only
410230	got the one setting but the fact that
412000	you've got this adjustability although
414220	I'm not sure what some of these settings
416350	are actually for like maybe if you
418240	wanted to sort of hold it at a bit of an
420610	angle like this and then you have maybe
422830	you have like kind of a longer right arm
424780	and you want to hold it over here
425950	I don't know mostly I can see people
427720	using it like this or in the left handed
430030	configuration here the trend around and
431920	then use it on the other side but yeah I
435760	guess I've said pretty much all I want
437200	to say about it this looks pretty cool I
438730	can't wait to try it out I'll be doing a
440610	more full review once I find out well
443590	how's the wireless signal strength how
445570	comfortable is it to actually sit on the
447850	couch and browse the internet or play
449890	some games and overall my impressions
452470	are quite solid
459320	Oh
