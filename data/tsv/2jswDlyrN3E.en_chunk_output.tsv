6740	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9179	the vengeance and then 200 standard
12330	edition from Corsair yes it was only a
15059	matter of time Corsair has speakers mice
18180	keyboards headsets they had to do a
21990	mousepad at some point so this is a
23580	glide optimized textile surface which
26580	basically means as a cloth mousepad okay
29519	a little friction design for gaming
32009	mouse sensors I should certainly hope so
34260	non-slip natural rubber base that's good
37110	okay the glide optimal let's just see
39570	what they have to say for themselves
40590	because there's not much to say about a
41820	mousepad the gaming tuned cloth surface
43680	delivers excellent led characteristics
45149	allow you to execute that swipes or pull
47070	off high precision shots with confidence
48629	and consistency carefully screened a
51840	surface material that delivered
53100	excellent tracking with any gaming MOS
54360	sensor stable and secured so we added a
56190	no-slip base that provides a cushion
58020	with just the right amount of give it's
59699	made of natural rubber so it doesn't
61800	have a harsh chemical order harsh
63600	chemical odors actually are a bit of a
65670	mousepad problem from my experience in
68610	the past alright okay I can still see
75240	okay not a little bit dizzy so that's
77009	good so there you have it it's a cloth
79590	mousepad size looks pretty good
81780	so you could you know we had a mouse
84330	around here you know how to better find
85500	a mouse yeah for sheer scale so you can
88710	see what that actually glides pretty
90360	nice you can see what of Corsair and 60
93000	looks like on it so you could move like
96150	this on it I don't know what else you
98400	guys want me to say I mean the the
99960	non-slip pad on the bottom is pretty
102420	good you can see it doesn't move pretty
104520	much no matter how much pressure I put
105750	on it you can move it easily if you lift
107820	it up a little bit but what else is in
109950	the demo there's of course our logo on
111329	the bottom right corner thank you for
