960	[Music]
6680	welcome to my unboxing of a product that
9510	you probably will not be able to figure
11730	out what it is at all if I don't show
15269	you this this text right here so like on
17850	the front there's like okay we're going
20880	to try and figure out what all this
21840	stuff is so there's a sword handcuffs
24320	sigh like a hammer war hammer another
28859	sword another more different sword like
30630	a fighter plane a tank a bazooka a
33690	sniper rifle a rocket launcher a bullpup
38870	three grenades a stealth fighter or
41610	bomber bomber sorry sorry a helicopter
43770	like friggin like missiles like on a
46800	boat or something like they're on a boat
48960	a boat a submarine another more
51449	different boat a different tank a
53129	different fighter a sword a sword an axe
54809	a grenade a sigh and another short it is
59070	a gaming keyboard intended for all these
61770	different purposes it's gonna be
62730	handcuffs what game is bulbs handcuffs
65869	so let's have a look at all the
68010	different things that we have on the box
70320	two ways cord out so you can actually
72030	manage your cables durable braided
73740	cotton corn corn cord cotton corn cotton
77430	candy candy corn gold plated USB
80880	connector LED backlight elimination with
83009	on/off switch twin USB 2.0 ports on the
85110	two sides you know what let's actually
86549	get the keyboard open because that way I
88500	can show you all these features on the
90180	keyboard itself as we go which is a
92220	sensible way to do unboxings sometimes
94909	unboxers on the youtubes they like oh
98009	this is the black version it's available
99990	in red and yellow sometimes unboxers on
102150	the youtubes they just like take forever
103530	to actually get the product out of the
104909	out of the box and I know I'm guilty of
107130	that at times at times I'm the worst
109920	about that but whatever you make an
115710	unboxing channel BAM okay
118469	key remover tool these are really handy
120600	if you have to remove your keys then
122310	you'll have one replacement WASD keys
132120	okay I'm sure we'll find out why when we
135520	look closer at the box there's the
138190	braided cord looks very nice gold
141250	plating in there which is valuable gold
142930	plating out here which doesn't do a
144130	whole lot
144520	remember gold plating is good for good
147250	for connectivity not necessarily
149170	conductivity silver plating would
150760	actually be better for conductivity
152170	incidentally so would copper I believe
154120	but gold is malleable and it is also
158080	very resistant to corrosion so no matter
162220	how long the gold-plated connector sits
164019	around it will never corrode and it will
166780	always make a contact also makes it able
170230	to do more plugs than unplug
171820	look at that I haven't seen a keyboard
173739	cover in a while there's a DVD that you
177940	should probably ignore put the latest
180069	from gigabyte in terms of software here
184120	we go I haven't seen a keyboard cover
185890	like but like a dust cover like this in
187300	a long time check that out very nice
190170	once again use protection very good in
195700	fact oh look at that you can even leave
197170	it on I remember these the ones that you
198850	just like left on and use the keyboard
200260	so you don't get like you know like like
202690	cheesy cheese in between the keys which
205900	is really hard to get out you know like
207100	Cheetos when you use the when you eat
209049	Cheetos and then you use your keyboard
210250	right away you can get like the bit the
211690	crumbs like stuck around in your fingers
213160	and then you type and it knocks it into
214840	the keyboard it's really hard to get it
216190	out so this is I mean this is a problem
217600	any gamers face so I'm glad that
219609	gigabyte has engineered a solution to
221799	this excellent okay what do we got G
226060	Keys programmable keys with an
227980	indentation on there not an indentation
229570	a bump on this one so you can easily
231100	feel which is which that's very nice
232930	three modes for the G keys we've also
235209	got mute and yeah we're gonna have to
239709	figure out what those are ahem
243250	touch and slide volume control sweet
246390	interruption free volume control device
248260	during engaged gaming activity computer
250480	stays in current mode without going in
251650	and out of games keep the sensor on the
252970	far left or the far right volume will
254799	increase or decrease linearly very cool
258339	very cool indeed ghost macro engine
261500	macro Keys per mode to make up to 25
263570	sets of macros with a total of five
264830	modes change modes easily with mode
266540	button on the keyboard we already saw
267710	that one for megabit onboard memory
270140	enables up to Hot 100 programmable macro
272900	sets predefined cue button to switch
274160	between easily software features easy to
275840	use drag and drop function as you guys
278360	know gaming keyboards often come down to
280550	the software now this is unique this I
282680	actually want to like sort of see see
284870	what I think of ok you know what I can't
290600	I can't actually feel that much of a
294440	difference when typing but gigabyte has
296080	specifically engineered the keyboard to
298820	have different force required for
303320	different keys on the keyboard so the
304730	lightest keys are your shifts your Z and
310100	X all these ones that you have to hit
312080	with your pinky while you're gaming your
314060	heaviest keys are your space your
316280	control your WASD and your top four
319400	number keys which you're usually mashing
321620	with a ring finger or a middle finger or
324050	an index finger whichever the case may
325610	be your medium keys are sort of most of
328669	your typing stuff so whether this makes
331910	that much of a difference for gaming
333290	hard to say but there you go at least
334820	they're thinking about it xx
336380	anti-ghosting keys so press up to 20 of
338479	these at a time without any ghosting so
340610	if you guys know what ghosting means
342580	ghosting occurs when you press two keys
346430	and then it registers off like a third
348169	random keystroke it usually happens with
350150	more than two though it's for like five
351830	or six at a time so most people don't
354290	have more than like six keys mashed at a
358460	given time unless they use their face to
359900	type but hey there it is gift silicon
364490	keyboard protector and additional WASD
366620	alternatives so I guess these are like
369140	oh nice they have like a soft touch feel
373700	like huh that's kind of neat so they
376010	feel a little bit different so I guess
377390	you can find them more easily so let's
379250	have a look at the rest solution i'm
380419	lock light caps lock light scroll lock
382130	light there's your mute more buttons so
386210	membrane keyboard so the key switches
388340	aren't really anything to write home
389750	about although what they've done with
391550	the different elastic force there's
392750	going to be sort of AI people who either
394070	love it or hate it
394860	a kind of feature there you go
398039	membrane Keys click that back cover up
404159	the membrane um the wrist rest on this
406740	is actually fairly unique I've only seen
408300	one other keyboard and like a gaming
410219	keyboard that has a wrist rest like this
412110	and that's the SteelSeries 7g and my
415110	wife actually uses a 7g and refuses to
417240	use any other keyboard not because she
418770	particularly likes the feel of the keys
420719	and the typing experience because but
422520	because she loves the big wrist rest and
424759	yeah it's it's actually it's one of
427110	those things once again you love it or
428580	you hate it but if you love it then well
430919	love it and it's good here we have the
433529	cable management stuff so you can either
434789	come out in the middle or on the side we
436500	also have flip stents with rubber grip
439439	thumb this side so you can and rubber
441599	grips on this side so it's not going to
442949	move anywhere you got actually lots of
444300	little rubber grippy miss all over the
446939	keypad all over the keyboard this is
448949	awesome look at this this is actually
450449	screwed on
451590	instead of using cheesy plastic Clips
453689	okay how many of you out there on a g15
456889	how many of you out there broke the
459419	wrist rest off your g15 I did loves I
463319	didn't even know this but slick just put
464909	up his hand because it was cheesy and it
466740	used little horrible plastic clips this
468419	is amazing this is engineering a
470580	solution to a problem that people have
472529	very good job gigabyte um so I think
475740	that pretty much covers it thank you for
477479	checking out my unboxing and first look
479099	at the a via from gigabyte oh yeah
481830	incidentally there's a couple more USB
483089	ports here they have rubber plugs in
484800	them there oh no sorry back here and
487759	here so you can plug in your mouse or
490800	like a USB Drive nothing oh there's your
493139	light on and off switch for the
494909	backlight and I'm just heading this way
496919	so that I can plug in the keyboard so it
499349	doesn't have to follow me and just look
500580	at the keyboard so that we can see the
502830	backlight or make sure oh it's on yeah
509159	okay give me a sec any sec you've got a
510930	log of lights on in here select you want
512549	to have a look at the light actually no
513690	there man you'll see our horrible CEDIA
515390	so I'm just going to turn the lights
517198	down so you guys can see the red
519299	backlight on this black keyboard so
