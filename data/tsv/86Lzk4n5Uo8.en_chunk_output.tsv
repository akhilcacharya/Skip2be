30	today I'm gonna be unboxing another
3000	gaming peripheral this is the Microsoft
5130	Sidewinder x8 Wireless Gaming Mouse so
9120	you can see in the packaging here we've
11130	got 4000 dpi the cameraman is closing
14160	the door to his office because there are
15540	people just close the door cream cheese
18439	it is a 4000 dpi Gaming Mouse with play
21960	in charge and it runs at 13,000 frames
24990	per second so that means that the little
26699	laser camera in this mouse is taking an
29820	image of the surface under it 13,000
32668	times per second in theory so that
35730	should mean very very smooth performance
38250	ok so we have a resolution of up to 4000
40350	dpi max acceleration of 75 G's max speed
44460	of a 120 inches per second and up to 30
47280	hours of Wireless playtime which is
49260	pretty good cuz even the most hardcore
51199	Wow
53280	what are they called raids raid player
56129	is probably not going to be playing for
58079	30 hours straight I think I hope okay so
63660	the box of this opens in kind of a
65309	creative way that is gonna make it very
66990	very hard for me to put this back
69000	together afterwards and there we go it
72000	comes out like that so we just unfold
75240	these little tabs here and I'd love to
77100	have a look at the mouse in person so
79530	there it is that's the x8 up at the top
82080	we've got three buttons here and then we
83670	have a button here on the side we have
85890	our back and forward buttons that's
87780	that's actually pretty ergonomic usually
89670	you see the back and forward buttons
90659	like that in this kind of orientation
92610	but this is kind of cool it's like a
93990	little rocker button here we have a
96390	third button on the left hand side here
98280	it's nice to see more buttons on the
99720	left because I mean some mice kind of go
101880	overkill with it whereas others I mean
103799	it feels like yeah you could have a lot
105240	more back there without interfering with
107250	anything this kind of looks like it
108780	comes off but maybe it doesn't okay so
110970	on the right side you've got kind of an
112350	ergonomic groove for your for your pinky
114960	I'm just gonna show actually it's not it
117719	seems like the way this Mouse is
119159	intended to be used is with your pinky
121500	resting here because if you try to hold
122969	it this way it's kind of uncomfortable
124649	it leaves a lot of your hand exposed
126420	down here and while we're here we can
128160	look at the bottom so you've got little
129830	stick non-slip non-slip slipping pad
134280	okay nonstick pads then you have the
136650	power switch at the bottom and inside
138690	here is the blue track technology so the
141240	Sidewinder x8 actually doesn't use a red
144210	laser it uses a blue laser which is in
146250	theory better okay and then this seems
149520	to be the battery holder yeah so that's
151740	where we put the battery inside so why
154080	don't we have a look at what else is
155250	included with the x8 okay a double-a
158130	battery this one is a rechargeable
160050	nickel metal hydride battery and so we
162870	can charge it by using and this has got
165510	cool feature because this is one of
166830	those wireless / wired mice so you can
170870	plug this puck which is just a wrapper
174090	for the cord for the mouse in by USB to
178650	the back yoke imputing so there's a USB
181020	cord there and then you can either use
183420	the mouse in Wireless mode and this is
185670	your receiver for that or you can plug
188430	this in Oh check that out and it's a
192120	little magnetic charging / wired
194700	interface for the mouse so thank you for
197880	checking out my unboxing of the
200070	Microsoft Sidewinder x8 gaming mouse
