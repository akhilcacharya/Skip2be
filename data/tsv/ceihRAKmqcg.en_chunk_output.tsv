30	this video is brought to you by the
1560	intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
5069	if you're a speed freak added until 3500
8010	series SSD to your Haswell system for a
10500	truly enthusiast class experience
12540	alright guys that's it
16970	Corsair listens to everything that
20660	pretty much well everything that I
23070	thought was wrong with the original K 60
25710	this my friends is the K 70 in one of
29640	its configurations so we're going to
31740	start with the things that carried over
33719	from the K 60 which this is sort of you
37350	can tell it in is inspired by the K 60
40110	because you've got the replacement key
42360	caps that have the contour so you can
44489	find them more easily when you're not
45780	looking at it it still has that aluminum
48750	backplane that really makes Corsairs
50879	keyboards not only feel extremely rigid
53160	but also be built extremely solidly and
57149	look extremely cool and all that good
60000	stuff
60539	and she started here to those here's
62820	those key cats that come with it there
65400	we go
65909	it also has a wrist rest but it's
68130	missing the little sort of you know not
70920	stromal thing that goes with the WASD
73290	keys so I'm not really convinced that
74909	too many people would have used anyway
76590	and it still has here we go anyway this
81090	one in particular has Thierry MX red
83549	switches a little more on that in a
84960	moment there we go it has built-in media
89430	keys which I think are among the best
91500	dedicated media keys out there just
93720	because I love volume wheels so much and
96900	this one has like a nice just textured
99119	metal finish to it mute as well as stop
101909	back play pause and forward it has a
104610	windows lock button and okay more on
106920	this in a moment that is a backlight
108659	control button and it still has a USB
111750	pass-through now okay all of yeah right
115200	so it still has 100% anti-ghosting and I
118829	think that's pretty much it so what has
121110	Corsair improved on the K 70 number one
125369	all mechanical keys f1 to f12 and these
130739	keys over here no longer had
133020	any rubber dome key switches so the
135060	keyboard is fully mechanical now also
137220	check this out guys it is available hmm
141210	with a backlight so we've got a red
143610	backlight one right over here there we
146130	go
146520	that has a black finish oh yeah did I
148830	mention it's available with different
150930	finishes on the aluminum backplane now
153630	which I personally think the red and
155700	black looks absolutely gorgeous although
158010	the classic blue and silver Corsair
160530	mechanical keyboard thing is not a bad
161940	thing either not only that but it is
164040	available with a variety of key switches
166590	now so you are no longer limited to
168810	Cherry MX red now the ones that I have
170580	here in front of me you can always tell
172590	the key switches in use by simply
174480	popping them off if they're cherry Keys
176400	then they are going to be color coded
179100	the type of key switch that they happen
181020	to be I'm just going to go ahead and
182400	show you guys the blue version here if I
185910	can find that USB plug there we go so
188190	you can always tell like that but there
189990	will be versions of the keyboards
191730	available that use other key switches so
194040	blue and brown which we're going to call
196230	the slick Edition and the Linus Edition
198990	will also be available a mess is really
201060	exciting to me because Corsairs build
202770	quality on their keyboards is
203970	outstanding there's almost no flex to
206430	the things whatsoever making them well
208709	yeah
209160	outstanding but the only thing holding
211020	me back in the past was the fact that
212910	they use cherry MX Reds they have a very
214440	unique look because the keys are
217670	significantly higher above the first
220200	visible part of the keyboard then you'll
221910	see on most other keyboards and what
224160	this does is it gives the backlight more
226770	of an of an under glow effect that I
229260	personally think looks absolutely
230610	outstanding on their keyboards whether
233010	it's in blue or red now on the back of
235860	the keyboard you can see that we've got
237750	a couple more options in terms of
239459	elevating it so you can elevate it here
241880	drop that down there's rubber feet here
244080	you can elevate it at the back just like
246900	that and you can attach or remove the
249239	wrist rest at will they've got a bit of
250890	a different system for this it's plastic
252510	now instead of metal but it still does
253920	feel quite strong so I'm not too worried
255780	about it and then also at the back
256950	you've got different bottle switches so
258899	this should improve the compatibility of
260608	the keyboard which I personally think is
262410	a very positive thing and that was one
263880	of the issues that people have with
266070	the original k 90 and the k 60 and the
268920	reason for that is that in order to do
270810	things like 100% anti-ghosting or multi
275700	key rollover over USB you have to place
277770	them you have to play around with the
279360	way the keyboard works a little bit and
280770	sometimes this decreased compatibility
283050	now with the case 70 Coursera has
285480	managed to enable 100% anti-ghosting and
289320	n key rollover meaning you can roll over
291540	as many keys as you want which is very
294720	very cool but they've implemented that
296340	bio switch in order to improve
298020	compatibility they've also changed some
300120	textures so you can see the space bar
301650	has a bit of a textured feel to it now
304410	that looks quite different from the
306210	older one and they have added of course
309660	new replacement key caps so I'm going to
312000	switch over to our red one here I'll
313920	show you guys that one instead I'm going
315720	to swap that USB plug there we go and
318120	I'm going to show you how I have swapped
319770	out the WASD keys and the 1 2 3 4 5 6
323880	keys up at the top here the idea behind
325860	these is if you can see the contour see
328710	this this curved shape here between
331140	these keys I hope you can see that if
335610	you see the contour the idea is you
336960	should be able to find your way back to
338070	WASD and to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 keys without
341370	looking more easily now the ones on the
344100	k60 had a very rubber feel to them a
346890	rubber finish to them that I personally
348300	didn't find that appealing but these are
350640	more of a hard plastic there you go and
353660	they're much more similar feeling to the
356280	rest of the keys on the keyboard so you
357930	can still rely on the shape to find them
359610	but you don't have to deal with the fact
361710	that they have a bit of a different
362730	texture to them which I personally found
364830	a little bit obnoxious and I didn't I
367860	didn't really want to use that feature
369450	now last but not least this is the CUDA
372300	grass of this particular keyboard it has
375020	off low medium and high backlight levels
381920	ok so you're not that impressed yet but
384450	it also has this feature which I
386340	personally think is pretty friggin cool
388560	check that out so we have set up this
390510	keyboard already to only have the arrow
392820	keys windows keys not that one WASD keys
397110	and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 keys illuminated
399810	you can eliminate any combination of
402000	keys that you so desire
405570	I say I want my escape key and I want
408300	all of these on all I have to do is hold
410970	down this button set it up the way I
412770	like it so you know I want like a cross
415470	here then I hold it down again and voila
420810	it is now set and it will remember those
423060	settings so you can have whatever
424470	combination of lighting that you want
426240	and you can switch between completely
428940	backlit and only backlit where you want
432120	it to be very very cool thank you for

440760	know in the comments under the video or

447210	of the k70 has Corsair hit the nail on
450270	the head this time you let us know but I
453210	think that they actually did very very
455669	cool stuff
