179	freshbooks is the simple cloud-based
1890	accounting solution for freelancers and
3750	small business owners check it out at
5460	the link in the video description so
8370	we're here at the Sony booth where they
9630	are showing off the next evolution in
12030	their short throw 4k laser projector
15780	technology this one differs from
18930	previous iterations in that it is a
21210	little bit more furniture like in its
23910	implementation so instead of just
26699	containing a 4k laser projector it also
30300	has a built in shelf and maybe the
33480	powers coming back on now nope they were
52440	just informing us that there is a power
54239	outage we noticed thank you sorry for
59309	that so in a nutshell it is a more
61680	complete package than ever before and
64709	that's why it actually costs more so
66960	while the last generation had a couple
69150	of cabinets and speakers this one has a
71939	shelf which is cool because you can put
74970	your xbox excuse me your your
77790	PlayStation down there and it also has
80070	three excuse me five speakers and a
83460	subwoofer so there's two tweeters using
85920	Sony's advanced vertical drive so
88140	they're actually glass and they radiate
90689	sound in all directions and there are
93150	three mid-range speakers built into the
95310	chassis with one of them actually firing
97860	out the back that acts as a centre
100890	speaker so it's it's pointed at the wall
102840	and then it bounces the sound towards
105149	the viewer the sub is actually the big
108180	thing that's kind of at the back near
110340	the bottom and from listening to it it's
113040	actually surprising how much sound
114960	they've managed to pack into this little
117240	package now let's talk about the image
119880	so it actually uses pretty similar tech
122340	to Sony's last generation solution so
124649	it's still a single laser DLP but that's
127079	without a spinning colour wheel so you
128848	shouldn't see any rainbow effect and it
130919	can handle a maximum image size of a
132750	hundred and
133540	20 inches at only nine and a half inches
136329	from the wall so that's actually pretty
138069	similar to what we're looking at right
140170	here it's 4k it's HDR it has a maximum
144250	luminance of 2500 lumens and they're
146620	planning to make it available in the US
148390	sometime this spring now it's gonna cost
151989	you a pretty penny at about $30,000 but
155859	if you think of it more in terms of like
157890	fancy furniture pricing and less in
161409	terms of firing a laser projected image
164920	at your wall pricing then maybe that
167889	starts to get a little bit more
169269	reasonable if you're into that sort of
170620	thing I mean you got your engineered
172359	marble top you got your design that I
174579	think subjectively looks pretty darn
176889	good and neutral so it should look great
178840	in pretty much any space that's that's
180489	real wood on the shelf there folks and
182319	you know what else is real the time you
184180	can save with fresh books fresh books is
