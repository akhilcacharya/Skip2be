60	hey guys welcome to my Razer chroma
2550	series video make sure you hit that
4830	subscribe button for daily tech videos
6810	I'm going to move that reminder to the
8069	beginning of my video see if that makes
9300	a difference anyway don't worry too much
10440	about that now RGB custom color headsets
13860	and mice aren't exactly new and neither
16590	are the razer deathadder mouse kraken
18690	7.1 headset or Black Widow ultimate 2014
21630	but this is the first time we've seen
24840	those two things together
34880	coolermaster neptune series CPU coolers
37500	are available in a variety of radiator
39329	sizes to perfectly suit your next build
41520	click now to learn more let's start with
44910	the simplest of the three the Kraken 7.1
47010	chroma which is basically just a
49200	straight carbon copy of the Kraken 7.1
51090	but I'll give you guys a brief rundown
53070	on it anyway it's got 40 millimeter
55170	neodymium drivers a headband with size
57539	adjustments and folding the ear cups
59850	swivel for a good fit against your head
61469	and it connects to your PC with a
62789	braided USB cable the software includes
65489	surround calibration some dials that you
67950	can use to tune the integrated sound
69570	card
70049	I'd recommend turning down bass boost by
71850	the way more on that in a minute a mixer
73799	in case the one in Windows wasn't enough
75240	for some reason and EQ which is actually
77430	nice to have included and finally
79200	lighting controls of course you can
82290	choose between any solid color breathing
84630	in any color and cycling through the
86400	entire 16 point eight million color
88290	spectrum and I guess this seems like a
90240	good opportunity to point out how
91979	responsive and bug-free the software is
94110	but also how limited these options are
96689	to color breathing and breathing rates
99000	as well as color cycle speed adjustments
101549	would be welcome additions to this
103320	product if I thought it made any sense
105329	to buy it anyway unless you must have
107939	RGB lighting on your headset I don't
110189	really recommend the Kraken 7.1 at $100
112979	even with bass boost off lows are very
116610	overpowered to my ears and the
118469	microphone is well all I forgot to press
122549	record over here so I'm going to do that
123899	now and I will let you evaluate that for
126780	yourself now while I'm sure min-liang is
129989	in the process of writing an angry tweet
131670	to me I guess
133900	this might help to stay his hand because
136120	with the DeathAdder chroma it's a very
138400	different story this seems to have
140080	gotten some very tangible improvements
142180	over the death out of 2013 ergonomics
145060	are still a strong point the rubber side
147069	grips still feel great but now the
149349	braided cord is one of the best i've
151030	ever encountered with almost no kink
152980	left after back bending the right and
155049	left click are significantly heavier so
157930	I don't accidentally press them
159310	constantly and the sensor has been I
161650	don't know what word you'd want to use
163510	for this type of interpolation
164860	tomfoolery so let's just say overclocked
167200	to 10,000 dpi or CPI if you prefer from
171040	6400 in the original death out of 2013
174190	so next time you're gaming at the local
175780	IMAX you can crank that the lighting is
178780	better implemented than with the Kraken
180790	but still kind of incomplete feeling the
183099	Razer logo on the back supports the same
185170	modes as the Krakens so solid breathing
187959	and cycling but the scroll wheel doesn't
190599	support breathing for some reason so
192129	that's the bad news the good news though
194409	is that unlike the headset the mouse
196599	supports different lighting schemes when
199209	your mouse profiles Auto switch as you
201310	launch various programs great inclusion
203440	and I really like how smooth the color
206109	transitions are very neat which leads us
208690	finally to the Black Widow ultimate
211000	chroma this is my second Black Widow
213310	ultimate 2014 and if you didn't show me
215620	the lighting tab in the software well I
217480	probably would never know the difference
218980	you can get my full thoughts in a review
221650	here but in a nutshell it's still got a
224319	matte black finish with subtle frosted
226720	lock key lighting and a shiny Razer logo
229000	at the bottom it's still got five extra
231099	macro keys on an otherwise standard
233079	layout where every key is fully
234760	programmable and however you may feel
236889	about this it still uses razor's own
239349	branded mechanical keys which is
241239	manufactured by Kyla and China due to
243519	the constraints apply of Cherry MX
244870	switches back to that lighting tab in
247359	the software again though the keyboard
248859	obviously got the most attention from
250989	razor's deads in addition to auto
253209	profile switching and the modes that the
255099	other devices support the keyboard gets
257108	a suite wave pattern that can run either
259539	left to right or right to left but
261430	regrettably doesn't support custom
263080	colors or speed alterations it gets a
265599	reactive mode
266480	that fades incredibly smoothly it looks
268580	really nice and a custom mode that you
270800	can use to either apply profiles for a
273110	variety of genres or even specific games
275390	or build your own according to your
277520	preference I went with a combination of
279620	hot pink and purple that I think looks
281210	absolutely fabulous so its conclusion
285260	time and I'm finally going to address
287690	the elephant in the room
288710	Razors chroma products are not the only
291080	RGB gaming products to be released in
293000	the last month or so so who has the best
295130	RGB product lineup razor or coarser
297800	we'll start with the headset the revised
300200	H 1500 from Corsair sounds much more
303020	balanced than the Kraken and is more
304970	comfortable for me but unfortunately not
307400	only lacks RGB lighting but has a
309830	horrendous yellow accent to go along
311570	with the new trance tent logo and so
314300	there you go frankly I wouldn't use
315530	either of them so we'll call the headset
317030	a dry guess on two mice Corsair would
320240	have had a shot at this if they've done
321860	an M 45 RGB instead of an M 65 RGB
325910	because I really like the shape of their
327830	mice and the M 45 uses an excellent
330440	sensor along with a firmware that
331880	doesn't GIMP it too hard
333260	a combination that's surprisingly
334790	difficult to find but even though
336560	Corsair has more lighting zones due to
339200	the m60 5's use of a laser sensor with
341570	inherent acceleration I have got to give
343850	the nod to the Razer DeathAdder chroma
345790	which leads us to keyboards and general
348980	thoughts I guess both razors and
350960	Corsairs implementations feel a bit
353840	rushed to me but in different ways Razer
356360	hides it a lot better than Corsair
358250	because the synapse 2.0 interface even
360770	though the functionality hasn't been
362240	changed since the old keyboard and the
363560	lighting modes are very limited is super
366020	easy to use and this allows Razer to
368720	gracefully without end user confusion
370850	add more features as time goes on
373430	whereas Corsair built in shed loads of
376160	functionality on day one lots of extra
378500	lighting modes and some really cool
379940	program ability that makes their RGB
382100	line a serious improvement over their
384650	original K line but overlooked some
388610	basics like default profiles for
390530	lighting modes and then they went and
391970	shipped the keyboard with 140 page
393770	manual that you will legitimately have
395360	to read in order to do any
397169	with it not a great end-user experience
399240	but software will improve for both so
402090	let's focus on the hardware trade-offs
403979	for now razors backlight is noticeably
406650	brighter but Corsairs
407939	is theoretically less prone to LED
409889	failure due to electrostatic discharge
411840	razor has passed through four USB and
414360	audio however poorly positioned they
415979	might be while corsair includes
417689	dedicated media keys razor includes
419999	macro keys on there one $69.99 model
422759	while corsair provides them only on the
425370	20-dollar step-up k95 model and in terms
428279	of looks beauty is in the eye of the
430169	beholder but I think razors matte black
432389	and Corsairs brush metal both look
435090	awesome so if we say that those
437699	trade-offs all cancel each other out the
440520	decision for me and for you probably is
443490	going to come down to the usage
444960	experience rather than the fancy lights
446879	of course there includes a wrist rest in
448860	the box which personally I find to be
451199	very important but you might not care
452939	and they use Cherry MX switches
455159	whereas razer uses their razer switches
457589	so ultimately that's the decision-making
461279	factor for me guys
