0	first you used our guide to buy the best
2340	cheapo keyboard out there then you
4830	complimented it with the best sub $15
7740	Mouse then you actually ended up
10320	replacing the original cheapo keyboard
12480	with a slightly less cheap but still
14670	inexpensive mechanical one and now it's
17910	time to complete your I spent all of my
21449	money on DLC equipment set with one
24990	final piece a gaming headset for less
28170	than $25 because you guys love a deal
32950	[Music]
40370	this cyber monday mass drop will be
43140	launching 40 of their best deals along
45960	with flash sales which will be live on
47969	their site for just 12 hours or until
50550	the item sells out so check it out at
53159	the link below
54469	first up well I'm not gonna mince words
58019	this is our cheapest pair the IP a P a P
63269	whatever the vibration gaming headphone
67140	and it costs just $10
69930	now I actually don't mind this
72090	personally but we're getting off to a
73950	bad start here vibration is just part of
77039	the product name not a feature which
78960	apparently disappointed at least one
80789	unlucky buyer with that said ap must
84390	have put the money that they saved on
85740	packaging to good use because their
88080	headset actually sounds okay if a touch
91259	base E and while exquisite is definitely
94860	a stretch for $10 the build quality on
97649	these things is surprisingly okay
99740	they're lightweight
101429	deep and cushy air pads and self
104729	adjusting suspension style headband make
106710	for a comfy listening experience though
108990	they do get pretty warm while the long
112140	and it's weird it's kind of greasy
114869	feeling cable and included splitter make
117810	them convenient to use with your desktop
119429	phone or console there's an integrated
122520	volume wheel and mic which despite not
125159	having a boom or a mute button for that
127499	matter sounds on par with most of the
129989	others in our roundup test test test
132000	this is the apogee vibration gaming
134459	headphones microphone sound at just 10
137190	bucks and if you plug in the extra USB
139620	you get multicolored breathing LEDs you
143370	can't control them but hey it's a bonus
146100	at this point I like this one now let's
148650	meet our next contestant just because
151019	your headset is cheap doesn't mean it
153840	has to look cheap but the GD 40s from
156720	headphone Ninja definitely do both of
159329	those things they're made of ugly cheap
161700	plastic and crude pleather and they
164730	don't fit well even on their smallest
167069	setting they don't seal on my ears
169140	properly though if you've got a real
171090	melon head then
172140	sure plop them on at least until the
174930	poorly padded headband digs into your
176850	skull on the plus side they've got a
178800	semi bendy ish what they're calling
182430	blade style microphone that's a boom
186420	microphone if you're not a ninja in your
188250	spare time and a braided cable with an
190560	inline controller that just looks almost
194190	as stupid as it feels in your hands they
196530	actually sound okay but with all these
198690	other problems who honestly cares
201060	next up the sadies SI 708 for $15.99 and
205890	a second are these things actually
208260	getting worse as the price goes up these
211320	things look more like pretend headphones
213840	for kids to play gaming team house
216330	rather than an actual product I mean
219209	just listen to that build quality and
223100	fit gets a big fat fail too if you have
226860	large ears these are on-ear headphones
229470	with hard uncomfortable padding and if
231959	you have small ears then they're sort of
234690	on ear headphones with hard
237360	uncomfortable padding sound quality at
239760	least has been pretty consistent across
241560	the headsets we've looked at so far but
243630	with that said the bass on these manages
245910	to stand out as extra money and it's one
248850	of the only ones that doesn't come with
250980	an adapter for console play and and
253049	while we're at it wait a minute this
254820	thing's got the same crappy inline
256918	controller as the last head set I guess
259200	at least it has emi shielding to ensure
262590	a good mood and to their credit the mic
265860	does conceal pretty nicely along with
268800	the rest of this thing in the garbage if
271320	your garbage can has a lid the Soumik g
274530	9:23 comes in white or black and
277020	advertises and not one but two places on
279479	the box a long hard microphone with high
283050	sensitivity ironically it's actually one
285780	of the few mics that stood out as
287220	especially quiet and distant sounding
289400	this is a test of the Soumik g nine to
292590	three stereo gaming headset at $17.99 to
298470	their credit they are not uncomfortable
300270	though the cops offer some articulation
302520	and the inline controls are small and
304979	equipped with a
305700	appreciated clip but the build quality
307230	on this one is really bad like think how
310170	bad it has to be to stand out in this
312390	roundup and look how far the mic sits
314760	from your mouth and listen to the
316890	headband adjustment mechanism they also
319710	included this inexplicable plastic bag
322290	is this supposed to be a carrying case
326750	next up then is the excellent GM one at
331190	1999 tons of padding actually makes this
334710	one reasonably comfortable despite the
337290	rigid design and while it sounds grating
340890	and low quality to the headband offers a
342810	lot of steps to help you find the right
344640	fit like the $10 headset this one also
347730	has LEDs but it's just static blue all
350610	day and it also has inline controls but
353730	it's one of those ones that hangs at an
355920	awkward length and the sound of it
358140	dragging across my clothes is definitely
360240	not invited to my next birthday party
362100	I'm afraid not even Bill and Ted would
364290	approve of this one next the $20 double
367590	in twos are kind of like a souped up
369900	version of the $10 ApS at least at first
373320	glance I can say positively that they
376560	are the first thing we've seen that
378240	comes close to premium feeling today
382080	with a soft touch finish braided cable
384540	and flexible boom mic but that beauty is
388080	only skin-deep or in this case a flimsy
391380	piece of pleather deep the ribbon of
394290	metal in the headband digs into your
396870	head in a matter of minutes oh and the
401550	caliper pressure on these is
402990	unfortunately so low that small and
405960	medium noggin folks alike won't ever
408540	feel like they're really staying on
410550	making matters worse for some
413100	inexplicable reason they put the mute
415590	switch right on the mic meaning that you
418320	have to make a bunch of scuffling noises
420390	while you take off the included windsock
423150	every time you want to use it next we
427680	have the version tech G 2000s which
430680	turned out to be the potion each
433340	whatever that means G 2000s when they
436770	arrived and on the subject of ink
439740	while they do definitely feature analog
442139	connectivity as advertised on the box
444389	they're actually blue not orange they've
447870	got a super flexible headband though for
449970	when your mind gets blown watching tech
452070	quickie and after a break-in period for
454410	that stiff headband foam they would be
457320	pretty comfortable if the ear cups
459180	weren't so shallow that my ears were
461669	pressed against the for some reason
463949	convex covers on the drivers this is
467039	honestly enough of a deal-breaker for me
469620	that even lighting effects can't make up
472199	for it but if you don't care about that
474240	then sound quality is similar to the
476280	rest and the boom mic is in exactly the
478800	right position to sit at the corner of
480419	your mouth if you're a catfish on to the
483680	wait a minute what's this a recognizable
489000	brand the N SIDS 500 ones have better
492720	build quality than their Red Ranger
494699	glossy plastic suggests and are actually
497460	among the most light and most
499380	comfortable headsets in the roundup
501180	today and they sound all right - with
503760	ample base without being too
505530	over-the-top
506190	though like the rest they do become
508650	pretty distorted and muddy at high
510539	volumes the mic boom pivots and bends
514200	which is really nice but with that said
517409	even correctly positioned the recording
519929	quality isn't the greatest this is a
522570	test of the MF IDs 501s for 2499
526610	bringing us finally to the stylish
529620	Patriot Viper v3 30s these guys have got
533190	a soft touch finish breathable fabric
535620	ear pads a nice ratcheting headband with
538200	a braided cable a nearly invisible fold
540870	away mic and integrated controls on the
543810	left ear cup they're one of the only two
546240	sets in the roundup to come with a
547800	travel bag and even though it's pretty
550709	Drac it's significantly better than the
552360	other one but with all that positive
554970	stuff said they're also the only set to
557250	stand out as overly tinny sounding
559320	they're not super comfortable and they
561329	are the most expensive one that we
563250	looked at today so which set do we
565829	recommend then as your new daily drivers
569930	well since they mostly all have
572769	comparable sound and mic quality it
574959	pretty much came down to comfort build
578350	quality and price which makes it really
581819	hard to beat the $10 a piece whose
585399	multicolored LEDs and construction put
588790	them way ahead in terms of value
590889	especially when you factor in that they
592329	cost less than half as much as some of
594369	the other ones we featured MSI's DS 501
597759	does cost more but was significantly
600939	more comfortable to my noggin and then
603519	if you don't dig the suspension style
605769	headband I'd say go for the be excellent
608319	GM ones this episode was brought to you
612220	by tunnel bear the easy to use VPN app
614769	when people are shopping for a VPN one
617199	of the features they look for is a kill
619749	switch
620290	now before you actually get properly
623619	connected to the Internet and you can
625179	start browsing your device will actually
627489	start to send information about itself
630129	and what it wants to do to you know that
633369	hotspot in the airport and before you
636519	connect to your VPN all of this traffic
639459	is actually unencrypted so in the few
642459	seconds it takes to connect you've
643929	probably already broadcast your IP maybe
646329	a few DNS requests or a search query
648540	vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops
651129	this by blocking all outbound and
653199	inbound traffic so nothing leaks out
656019	before you connect helping keep you
657819	private throughout your entire session
660040	and this is cool if your connection goes
663129	down for some reason vigilant bear will
665860	kick back in and stop all outbound and
669220	inbound traffic until the connection
670899	comes back so for a free trial of tunnel
