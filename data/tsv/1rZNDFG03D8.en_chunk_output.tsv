30	on my desk you see three mice one of
2490	which is my current favorite the
4560	SteelSeries series I carry laser okay
7890	the other of which is my old favorite
10290	the Logitech g7 you can see this is a
12840	very well used mouse I used it for a
15809	very long time and the other one is one
18750	that I would love to be my favorite this
20640	is the new Logitech G 700 so basically
25380	here's my problem with the g7 which I
27900	loved a lot back in the day this is my
31439	monitor this is a 30-inch monitor so
33570	here's like my foot for scale okay
36870	very large monitor as soon as I went up
39450	to the resolution of 2560 by 1600 what I
42510	found was that I was noticing a very
46200	substantial input leg from my g7 I never
50430	had problems with wireless peripherals
52110	in the past and I don't know why but it
54480	always seems to me that the higher
55980	resolution you go the more of a problem
58890	they become so back when I was running
61170	at ha she was at 1280 by 960 and that
66270	was with an MX duo I didn't have any
69689	issues but then as soon as I upgraded my
71850	monitor to this guy that is the Dell
74460	24:05 fpw so that was a number of years
77549	ago all of a sudden it was unusable and
80549	so I had to change my my set my mouse at
82500	that time and then when I went from that
84450	monitor to this one Samsung 305 T plus I
87479	had to get rid of my g7 because it was
90420	unbearably slow like I'd I'd moved the
92759	mouse and then there'd be a percept very
95130	very perceivable lag and then the mouse
97740	pointer would move so I went to the
99150	Akari laser
99869	now the g700 this one is just a unit
103710	from our inventory so I only get to
106170	tinker with it for a little while here
107729	but what I wanted to know was is there
110399	any in perceivable input lag with the G
114149	700 even at very high res and the answer
117570	is pretty much no so that was basically
122219	the whole point of this video but I can
124290	take a little bit of time and show you
125430	guys the the drivers which are excellent
127500	by the way I mean we've come to expect
129000	that from Logitech so you can assign all
131310	the buttons and there are many
133519	oops you're gonna have a hard time
135440	seeing though I suppose yeah there we go
136819	so there are some buttons there there's
138950	some buttons there they're the buttons
140720	all over the place so you can assign
142250	them to whatever you please
144500	you can assign different DPI settings to
147290	a bunch of different profiles you can
149330	set the report rate you can set all
151129	kinds of great stuff like what is it
153200	called snapping or something along those
154760	lines angle snapping right where it'll
157310	correct for straight line movements
159319	which I hate by the way I keep that off
161180	these are actually my preferred setting
162890	so I got a few different dpi settings I
164480	got speed I got acceleration not using
166519	the native OS I've got the polling rate
168560	up nice and high which is a good thing
170329	okay buttons very scrolling you can
172340	change that battery oh my mouse this
174109	battery is low which is fine because you
176359	can actually plug the g700 in and use it
180260	as a wired mouse and let it charge like
182540	that
182989	okay I've also got it set to the power
184849	mode of max gaming so that might have
186500	something to do with it I can manage
187609	macros I love Logitech's macro software
190280	I use it on my G 15 at home and my other
193489	more different G 15 at work and so thank
196370	you for checking out this little video
197510	so for anyone who was wondering well
201230	what's the what's what's the latency
203780	like what's the wireless latency like
205340	you know what it's pretty darn good it's
207530	not perfect it's not what I can I can
210500	feel it but it's not bothersome it's
212989	very very very very slight and I'm I'm
217519	really quite impressed with the G 700
220489	and for some reason my camera won't
221840	focus anymore I guess that's the camera
224870	telling me it's time to end the video
227299	thank you for watching don't forget to
229340	subscribe to I really won't focus at all

235549	but I have it on now so maybe that'll
237379	fix it yeah there we go so thank you for
