89	today's video was supposed to be an
2250	assassin's creed unity benchmarking
5190	video but as I found it extremely
7080	difficult to deliver a video to you guys
8820	that would have been up to our usual
10349	standard of quality thanks to various
12990	bugs and performance related issues
15480	throughout the entirety of the
16949	benchmarking process I decided to forego
19380	that plan entirely and play some better
21840	games some more stable games instead
24180	while testing the extremely interesting
26430	asus rog Gladius gaming mouse for more

53910	learn more clearly the most unusual
56070	feature of this mouse is the swappable
58530	Omron switches for the left and right
61199	click but the details of that awesome
63180	feature will have to wait for later for
65309	now we'll start with the physical
66600	overview at first glance it will likely
68549	remind you of a razer deathadder and for
71010	many people that's probably a good thing
72990	weighing in at around 115 hundred and
75509	sixteen grams it has some heft to it and
77939	I personally like the weight but if
79770	you're looking for a lighter Mouse
81000	you're kind of out of luck here as
83100	unfortunately there is no changeable
85259	weighting system in terms of grip as
87540	always it's different strokes for
89220	different folks but personally this most
91560	is too small for me to palm so I've
93960	fallen back to my trusty aggressive claw
96329	grip on the rubber sides unfortunately I
99240	didn't find the rubberized material to
100890	be grippy enough to easily hold the most
102990	while moving and lifting it especially
105000	once my fingers got a little bit sweaty
107280	after a little bit of gaming but my claw
109619	grip does have very few points of
111810	contact and those points of contact have
113909	a relatively small surface area due to
116520	my fingers pointing directly inwards
118619	towards the mouse itself on the other
121380	hand this most fits kind up perfectly
124290	for Linus's palm grip with the increased
126990	surface area of his palm grip he found
129209	the grips to not really be that big of a
131550	problem now there are more tight
133800	Grips than just these two and if my claw
136080	grip was a little bit more relaxed I
137970	likely wouldn't have an issue with the
139560	rubber grips either so your mileage may
141990	vary another thing to note about the
144240	left and right buttons is that they are
146280	separate from the rest of the noses
148050	actual body at first I thought this was
150600	pretty cool but upon further inspection
152340	I immediately noticed that they were
155040	noticeably wobbly unfortunately to the
157680	point where I even picked up on it while
159720	playing games this results in different
161910	areas of the button feeling drastically
165030	different depress I found personally
167160	that the worst spot was near the front
169830	of the button and the best spot was near
172290	the top on the inside which was both the
175830	most responsive and had the least amount
178440	of kind of horizontal awkward movement
181140	that brings us to the scroll wheel and
183360	dpi changing button the scroll wheel has
185970	this fairly standard fare it is a
188640	rubberized texture and nicely pronounced
191070	scroll points it also has a press into
193650	click but unfortunately lacks the left
195930	and right functionality that we see on
197910	some other scroll wheels the sensitivity
200640	changing button behind the scroll wheel
202260	has only two custom modes although
204330	personally that's all I would really use
206760	anyways these modes can be set in the
209220	driver where you also see a slew of
211590	other options amongst the sensitivity
214260	and 2,000 Hertz polling rate options
216510	you'll find angle snapping and
218370	acceleration which you should definitely
220590	leave off if you're a gamer also in the
223200	driver you'll find some button
224760	functionality editing macro setup and
227610	some basic lighting control options
229470	which include breathing which is always
231750	a favourite of mine back to the physical
234270	view of the mouse we have the removable
236220	USB cable slot which goes along with the
238680	two included cables at first look I was
241590	appalled to say the least not only do I
243959	hate micro USB cables because of how
246300	fragile they are but it also just seemed
248130	so unnecessary I've never had an issue
250890	packing a mouse safely to protect its
253560	cable due to their naturally small size
255810	but before I went on a crazy rant about
258120	how much I hated this I spoke with Linus
260548	who pointed out that in an emergency you
262800	could charge your phone if you didn't
264539	have another cable and this does seem to
266700	be a
267340	otters Mouse and while a mod or maybe
269310	swapping out a cable while they're
271180	swapping out their switches they could
272949	swap out that cable for a different
274870	color a different length lighter
277210	material who knows
279639	whatever it is they can do it they may
281979	need something like a glue gun to keep
283690	the cable in place as the included like
287139	squeeze mounting system that the cable
289389	has when you get it out of the box won't
291940	be on your replacement cable it it would
295330	still be possible while this doesn't
297340	necessarily make me happy with this as a
299380	design choice I must admit that it may
303160	possibly maybe make some sense but
307450	regardless of that we're now on the
309250	inside of the most or we get our first
310810	glance at the extremely easy to swap
313630	around switches the stock switches can
316240	be identified by either their white or
318490	gray protruding stems unfortunately I
321610	don't have any actual spec lists on
323740	these as the manual was quite sparse and
327190	as of yet there is no downloadable
330070	manual from their website although I'm
332139	sure this will be addressed once they
333880	watch this video and last but not least
336940	there is the sole of the mouse and the
339039	sensor that picsArt three nine eight
341560	eight featured in this mouse doesn't
343300	feel like it has any acceleration in my
345310	subjective testing and it felt quite
347440	good while playing counter-strike go
348910	which is a really good sign
351450	overall this is a very interesting Mouse
353950	well Isis has offered mice before I
356770	think it wouldn't be too bold to say
358930	this is their first real foray into the
361479	world of premium gaming mice and knowing
364030	a seuss it will only get better from
365470	here they changed the game up with this
367419	Mouse by introducing swappable switches
369610	hopefully they can keep the ball rolling
371229	and fix some of the quirks that
373300	prevented the Gladius from being as good
375940	as we were hoping alright guys thanks
377680	for watching thanks to Ubisoft I'm late
380560	for the LAN show and have to kind of run
