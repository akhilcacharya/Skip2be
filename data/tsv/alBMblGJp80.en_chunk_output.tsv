11309	this my friends is the next gaming
14340	peripheral that you need I think need is
17160	a pretty strong word especially
18390	considering the fact that it costs over
20359	$100 so if that scares you off then
23460	now's the time to go but this is my
26550	unboxing and overview of the skin key
29460	footboard the name it stinks but the
33360	product itself actually is outstanding
36600	alright so let's see what's inside the
38160	box I've been informed I have 80
39750	salesmen here but I actually kind of
41700	like it so maybe I'll maybe I'll stick
43170	with this look let me know in the
44190	comments if you think that I should I
45690	should stick with this or just get a
47430	haircut you hippie that's fine too
49440	so once we open it up we find the stinky
51449	foot board which is a four button foot
54360	pedal so this differs from the more
56250	traditional foot pedals in that it has
57930	four buttons as opposed to a single
60120	button we also find some Springs that
63210	are color-coded they have different
65220	tensions so the blue one is actually the
68250	lightest one with the red one and the
70979	green one being the yes the middle and
73860	then the hardest one non respectively
76320	because I said them in the wrong order
77460	also inside we're going to find a
79650	detachable USB cable this is actually
81720	quite important for a product like this
83100	more on that in a moment that plugs into
85170	the bottom of the unit and last but not
87720	least the allen key that will allow us
89939	to swap out these springs should we so
93000	desire so let's talk construction guys
95549	if this is something that you're
96659	expected to put your foot on or
98400	basically stomp on it's going to have to
99990	be well built
100710	now I'm informed that the one that I was
102750	jumping on at PAX have actually been run
105329	over by a car and was still functioning
107040	so how do they achieve that well it's
108750	got a t6 aluminum top plate it has a
110549	stainless steel center pivot bearing and
112619	a steel internal brace so the plastic
115290	that you're seeing here isn't all that
116880	there is to it it uses a custom PCB on
118979	the bottom and even down to things like
121020	the switches that they're using at all
123450	four corners I hope I can show you guys
125189	this get you an angle on it there you go
126719	oh yeah that's Cherry MX blue so you're
129508	going to get a 50 milli
131240	in actuation cycle out of each direction
134660	on the stinky foot board another
136640	durability feature we find on the bottom
138500	is that detachable cord I talked about
140420	before this is important for a couple of
142130	reasons number one is this thing lives
144080	under your desk so the odds of this cord
145820	getting destroyed are much higher than
147800	something else number two is because it
150890	lives under your desk and we don't know
152300	exactly where your pc might be being
154400	able to replace the standard length
156440	cable with something that's longer or
158510	shorter might help it fit in better with
160550	your cable management strategy now they
162590	don't rely just on the detachable cable
164660	to save it in the event of you know a
166490	cat or a foot accidently catching on it
169040	and there's actually a little cable
170090	routing c-shape here that will keep it
172400	from putting tension on the connector at
174200	a weird awkward angle no matter what you
176420	do to the wire also on the bottom we
178790	find the adjustable spring so we found
180500	those tension springs inside the box you
182960	actually get ten springs total which was
185390	a little odd to me because I would have
186860	thought they would just include four of
188870	each but you can see the stock load out
191000	has blue springs on the sides so
193130	remember those are slightly lighter
194600	tension and Green Springs on the ends so
197840	this can be adjusted to your heart's
199730	content the only configuration you can't
201740	have is four of the heaviest Springs the
204890	red one so it looks like the way they
206360	expect you to use it is heavier ones in
208790	the front and back because you're going
210890	to have more leverage when you're
212060	pressing down and then lighter Springs
213860	on the sides so this adjustability is
216140	great because you might want to use at a
217640	number of different ways whether it's
219260	putting your foot on it this way putting
221090	your foot on it this way leaning to the
222530	sides that way you want to be able to
224090	adjust it to whatever suits you best now
227030	what is the functionality of this thing
229430	exactly well it's different from other
230990	foot pedals in that there's four
232340	different ways you can go with the
233750	buttons so this just gives you more
235940	functionality than just binding
237950	something to push-to-talk or binding
240110	something to close all your windows when
243530	someone opens up the door behind you or
245120	whenever else you might have bound to a
246590	foot pedal no this is more for if you
249230	need additional modifiers or additional
251270	hotkeys so here's a great example as
253520	people will say well okay I've already
255230	got six buttons or twelve buttons or
257510	sixteen buttons on the side of my mouth
258769	why do I need another four buttons and
261019	the answer is because however many
263000	buttons you might have
264290	accessible to your thumb you still only
266630	have one thumb so this is another
269510	function that you can enable at the same
271880	time as your thumb so the ways that I
273950	see it being most useful are for things
276950	where your your finger that would
279500	otherwise be executing that action could
281330	be tied up so if I'm strafing to the
283400	right and I need to reload and I don't
285740	necessarily want to stop strafing to the
287390	right if I bind my reload here boom I
289490	can reload without ever taking a break
291680	without ever stopping moving another
293420	great example push-to-talk if I don't
295760	want to hold down my left thumb which is
297710	what I used to bind the two left thumb
299540	if I don't want to hold that down while
301280	I'm talking to my teammates and I don't
303050	believe in using voice detection because
304850	you know who knows what I might be
306710	saying to the people around me that I
309080	don't want on my gaming buddies hearing
310610	or who knows who might walk into my room
311990	and be inappropriate then what I can do
314000	is I can just bind it here so I can just
315950	step and do that and not have it
317930	interrupt my gameplay even when I'm
319820	speaking and there's endless
321730	opportunities for bindings like this
324260	that are different than what you would
326150	otherwise have access to so for example
327950	it supports for modifier keys now so
330260	that's ctrl alt shift and the windows
332510	key giving you up to 16 functions down
334670	here you can do all kinds of crazy stuff
335870	like you could bind diagonal movement is
338300	another thing that it does now or you
340070	could bind different potions or
342590	different spells instead of using I mean
344600	I have small hands so reaching up to the
347360	number keys for my tool belt actually
349880	isn't always necessarily that convenient
352280	so having something like even two of
354080	these under my feet and having them
355970	bound to the first eight slots there
357620	would be much more efficient than me
359360	taking my fingers off of the movement
361040	keys and then potentially not even
362660	finding my way back so the functionality
364760	is all configurable within the driver
366230	which they're constantly updating and I
367880	think it's really cool not only for your
370160	typical gamer but also for people with
372530	disabilities as well so there you have
374120	one testimonial on their site that I
375500	think is really cool so the guy has it
377360	bound to wasd for his feet and then he
380030	doesn't have a left arm so he uses the
382190	right hand and then I guess you can bind
384080	all those you know fancy pants extra
386210	mouse buttons you have to all the other
387560	things you need to do and enjoy a gaming
389720	experience that you otherwise couldn't
391520	if you were limited to only being able
393440	to control your games with your hand so
395030	I think that's really cool it's not
396840	cheap it's a hundred and twenty bucks
398840	they asked me to mention that it's
400860	available at future shop and Best Buy
402180	although I should also probably mention
403770	that my affiliate link is under the
405540	video in the description so if you want
407340	to help us out then you can order there
408660	as well if you're interested in it if
410580	you're not interested in it I think I
412229	have a pretty good idea what your
413370	objections going to be it's really
414810	expensive it's over a hundred dollars
416630	for what is effectively four buttons so
420150	if you were to just evaluate the cost of
422400	your hardware like per button with a
424169	keyboard you could spend over $100 on a
426090	mechanical keyboard and get over a
427740	hundred buttons but it's not necessarily
429930	that simple they're a startup company
431340	they have to have money to repay
433800	whatever loans they've incurred up till
435930	now they have to have money to reinvest
437160	and make new products especially if you
439290	want to see maybe a lower-cost version
441510	in the future or you know maybe like a
443639	tone controller so that you can use your
445650	mouth to issue additional commands I
447300	mean I could be very cool the more ways
449070	we have to interface with our computer
450810	the better and I personally am willing
453930	to help them out with that now I mean I
456060	mean think about it I was even talking
457620	about a USB butt plug not that long ago
459560	imagine that is a control device
461250	clenched for push-to-talk like clinch to
463770	Prohm every time someone jumps out from
465720	a corner you get all tense you just
467160	automatically prone that's amazing
468780	that's great functionality I bet that is
471090	a million-dollar idea right there anyway
472710	press liked if you liked the video press
474419	dislike if you disliked the video if you
476070	felt very strongly about that
477180	inappropriate final comment there leave
479490	a comment on the video letting me know
480930	what you think of the stinky football
482280	what would you guys be willing to pay if
483990	you know you had to wait a year or
485729	something like that for a lower cost
487260	alternative or would you be willing to
488700	pony up for this one right now and as
