7290	today I have an unboxing of the a CEO of
10360	the 3d Tron and I believe what they need
13000	to say is levitron but you can clearly
14950	see this e is backwards in elite gaming
18340	manner in fact it's the the favorites
20500	let's be the troubles line or crosshair
24939	let three the true crosshair charm hmm
27759	okay whatever
29320	it's the levitron gaming keyboard it is
31869	a high performance gaming keyboard you
33850	can manually toggle the keyboard from
35079	standard mode to gaming mode an
36219	adjustable keyboard backlight will keep
37840	the action going even when the lights go
39280	out so this is a backlit keyboard with
41170	programmable macro keys ten times three
43570	programmable macro keys so using the
47620	hotkey shortcut specific keyboard
48910	characters or whole keyboard sequences
50620	through the keyboard software macro keys
52179	automatic profiles switching with the
54039	launch of user specified program or the
56019	press of a key the keyboard will be
57249	right on board with your game plan by
59499	automatically switching to the right
60670	profile very cool so that's what they
62199	mean by ten times three macro keys so
64089	ten macro keys with up to three separate
65979	profiles media Keys including volume
68200	up/down and mute keys for convenient
69970	audio control also equipped with
72010	replaceable core acidy gaming function
75160	keys with the key cap remover very cool
77020	so I'll show you guys that once we open
78220	it up the control the battlefield with
79870	the long description that if you really
82420	want to you can pause the video and read
84250	it ok customizable keys Auto profile
86650	switching through your profiles command
87850	centre that's the software macro keys
90070	media keys package contents and this is
92110	all stuff that we've covered before
93130	limited lifetime warranty that's
94930	interesting you don't see that very
96070	often on a keyboard so there you go
98080	limited lifetime warranty from an SEO ok
101970	baby up Oh
106470	lifetime support in addition to warranty
109540	by phone by live chat by email huh
112800	really not very often you see that on a
115630	keyboard
116140	Hey okay we got a QuickStart guide here
119320	in color showing you the macro keys the
123670	command center media keys other more
125830	different macro keys product features
128139	which we've covered twice now let's see
131080	if there's anything ok the key stroke
132310	length is 5 million this is a membrane
134110	keyboard so something to bear in mind is
137049	that at the price point this keyboard is
138939	at
139360	with the backlight built-in that is to
143290	be expected you're not going to be
144490	getting a mechanical keyboard at this
146470	kind of a price point and let's have a
154000	look at the processor in more detail
160030	after I cut this open with my knife
162160	off-camera oh no wait no I got it I got
163690	it
163930	turn it off just yet come apart I know
168880	my phone's ringing okay I'm going off
170350	camera in the baggie we find
173170	irreplaceable gaming Keys so you can see
177430	here we there's our there's our s which
180220	hold on w a s now I'm confused
185680	oh no W hey you know what let's get this
189940	report out of the bag first that will
192040	help us make things more efficient in
195760	the long term all right keyboard the
200590	overall look of the levitron is actually
202930	fairly good it's got a velocity black
206050	finish just around the keyboard itself
207880	the keys have a matte finish to them and
210250	then around the outside of it there is
212350	there's a more of a matte finish okay
214540	all of the control center keys up here
217750	these are glossy you can actually
219310	manually switch between the profiles or
221320	you can use the software to make it so
222910	that it will automatically switch
224380	between the profiles you can control the
226660	level of the LED backlight you can lock
228910	the Windows key that is a very useful
230769	functionality the last thing you want is
232480	to accidentally minimize your game and
234030	let's have a look at the positioning of
236260	the macro keys so there's five macro
238030	keys on the very far left five more
240310	macro keys on the very far right and I'm
242769	just gonna do a quick evaluation of what
244959	I think of the actual key responses
247030	themselves these are a very short travel
249010	so you're not gonna have to press them
251230	down a whole long way in order to get a
253870	response out of them what I would
255100	compare this to I'm not necessarily in
257350	terms of key response or feel but in
259959	terms of the travel distance is
261339	something from something from one of
263440	razors gaming keyboard lines so where
265690	they use like a here you can hear that
268479	very quiet
270400	so the switches are extremely quiet very
272620	low travel so just the general feel is
276010	similar to what I would get from from
279070	one of their keyboards although not with
280449	the glossy keys okay so the hello world
284470	I am seeing what I think this keyboard
287919	not bad actually it's a little bit mushy
291070	er than I would personally prefer I do
293680	like a little bit more tactile feedback
295300	but it's a trade-off because it does
297430	take a little bit longer to press a key
299139	that has more tactile feedback in terms
300880	of the layout of the keyboard itself I'd
302860	say there are no glaring errors other
305169	than the positioning of the backspace
307389	personally I have small hands and I very
310090	much prefer a long backspace and then a
313210	shortening of the Enter key so just
315100	putting this guy right here is my
317050	preferred layout because nobody presses
318639	enter up here but many people press
320139	ENTER here long shift keys that is a
322330	must for a gaming keyboard and then WASD
325360	everything is laid out as normal here we
328479	do have our media keys up here so
330010	there's your play pause as well as your
331810	volume adjustment keys I think that
334539	pretty much covers everything on the
335889	front of it let's move around to the
337150	back so it does have little feet that
339580	you can go ahead and flick up so if you
341410	want to increase the angle of the
343210	keyboard towards you
344320	or decrease it all you have to do is
346090	flip those and then let's have a look at
348340	the key remover so it does come with a
350139	key remover tool as well as replacement
353080	keys for most of the gaming area keys
356740	themselves so why don't we do our huh
361449	that that was easy and then we can take
365260	our and we can put it back on and now
367180	our has a reload not not it and if you
371199	like really wanted to thanks crew with
373000	someone who you know who has this
374650	keyboard you could take one of your
375880	spare keys and you could like you could
377860	do something like that just to be a jerk
383070	you jerk really slowly there Oh No which
387460	one's the a key hahaha that's pretty
390940	much it alright so thank you for
392410	checking out my unboxing of the levitron
394120	for me
