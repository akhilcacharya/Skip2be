30	this video is brought to you by our
1770	trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
5339	to my unboxing and first look at the
6990	SteelSeries apex raw gaming keyboard
9330	this is also the first unboxing that
11190	we're doing in our all-new steel series
13860	themed gaming den set that we're going
16410	to be using for steel series unboxings
18390	as well as steel series product videos
21390	showing you everything that there is to
22800	know about their products which are
24689	somehow different from unboxings in a
28260	certain way that is different alright so
30179	let's start with what they have to say
31140	for themselves about this designed for
33000	quick reflexes this is a low profile
35100	keyboard meaning that the keys don't
37140	need to be pressed down as far in order
39030	to actuate them it does use membrane key
40920	switches rather than mechanical key
42840	switches but given the price this should
44489	pretty much be expected it has raised
46559	macro keys and we're going to show you
47879	how this is used for fast key
49950	combinations as well as a brilliant
51870	white backlight with eight different
53219	levels of brightness other than that I
55530	pretty much know everything else there
57210	is to know about this keyboard having
58770	already looked at all this stuff so
60270	let's go ahead and get it open so steel
62190	series has a plain black box with a
63840	black mat inside and then once you open
66570	it up you find pretty much the keyboard
69060	itself in a plastic sleeve which I am
71729	having a great amount of difficulty
73890	removing and there we go that's my big
77340	effort that's like you know some kind of
81229	combo that I unlocked it's like the
84900	plastic removal and put the product down
87180	combo there we go
87960	okay we've also got a Quick Start Guide
89880	which should be pretty much plug the
91380	thing into the thing although they might
92460	give you a few little instructions about
94590	how to use the software that's included
96000	because there's some neat functionality
97590	in there and last but not least you've
99329	got a couple of rubber feet that can be
101220	used to adjust the angle of the keyboard
103409	so those just come in a little ziploc
105299	bag here so we're going to go ahead and
107009	put that behind it and show you guys
108810	first the bottom of the keyboard and
112399	there was a cat incident so yes alright
116670	so on the bottom you've got these two
118799	rubber feet that do not move and then
121259	you've got these two here which can be
122670	removed just by popping them off and
124290	then you can plug a new one into it to
126420	give the keyboard more of an angle
128429	compared to if you don't plug it in so
130318	there you go you can see that raises it
131640	about
132240	two meter or so maybe a little bit more
134160	than a centimeter and that's pretty much
136410	it for the bottom of the keyboard other
137790	than that it's well a keyboard so let's
140400	move on to the top layout wise I'm so
143820	happy to see SteelSeries has not
145710	committed any cardinal sins as I like to
148470	call them in terms of the layout long
150180	Shift key long enter long backspace and
153300	I love to see that macro keys are also
156510	sort of uniquely positioned on this
158550	particular keyboard in that they are
160530	here on the left where we've seen them
162240	many many times and they are also that
165360	that data above all of the F keys this
168030	is for a number of reasons so the ones
169590	here are because when you're on the WASD
172110	Keys which are you know pretty much the
174540	most common gaming Keys you can reach
176550	this you can reach this you can kind of
178260	reach this you definitely can't reach
180330	another row over and we've seen
181980	keyboards with as many as two or three
183540	banks of keys they're past two it gets a
186480	little bit on the impractical side these
188370	ones up here are meant for people who
190080	often use their F keys for binding
192420	abilities or whatever else so what you
194220	can do is you can either hit a macro key
196440	and you can actually see I'll give you
197820	guys a better angle here you can see
199380	that the macro key is raised
201210	significantly above the F key this
203010	allows you to feel where the macro key
205170	is without actually activating either of
207120	the buttons or you can actually program
210000	the keys to do a particular thing and
212010	then a particular thing so you can
213990	actually hit a couple of them one two or
217350	even three buttons as a as a combination
220500	move so this could be like you know fire
221910	one bank of missiles fire two fire all
224760	of them because we're stuffs getting
226830	real so go for it so that's really neat
229410	so there's five here twelve here for a
231840	total of 17 macro buttons and you can
233550	use the l1 or the l2 buttons to switch
235890	the functionality so you can have an
237660	unlimited number of profiles within the
239370	SteelSeries engine software and then you
241290	can have two layers of macro
242760	functionality per profile another really
244830	cool thing I mean this is the one of the
246000	things they'd actually don't talk about
247290	that much in the marketing but I think
249300	is really cool is you can completely
250560	reprogram any key on the keyboard to do
253020	pretty much whatever you want you don't
254940	have to leave it the way it is stock so
257130	you can see SteelSeries has relocated
258690	the Windows key from the right to the
261418	left and the SteelSeries key from the
263010	left to the right you can see my older
265230	7d
266100	here has a SteelSeries key on the left
268080	and a Windows key on the right so
270110	according to the feedback they've gotten
272310	people want the steal or they want the
274140	Windows key back on the left so they've
275550	gone ahead and done that now this is an
277620	ergonomic thing that slick diesel and I
279780	all agreed on when we saw this keyboard
281970	in the SteelSeries suite and that is
284400	this longer spacebar so I'm going to try
287760	and give you guys a good look at this I
289320	have two different feet on it right now
291090	so don't worry it doesn't normally do
292860	that but there you go so what this does
295200	is when you're typing a short space bar
297240	is fine
297870	it doesn't make any difference because
299190	you rest just the the side of your thumb
301380	on the key however when you're gaming
303330	you're much more likely to end up in a
305700	situation where you have your thumb
307170	resting down like this because you're
309720	not sitting on the home row you're
311040	actually a little bit further up than
312480	that so what this does is it's it's it's
314520	just meant to be a more natural way to
315990	press the spacebar without actually
317910	interfering with normal typing so I
320880	think that's a pretty cool little thing
322380	as well and moving right along oh yeah I
325320	should probably show you guys just the
326430	overall design of the keyboard I mean I
327750	talked about how it's low profile but it
329430	has sort of a cool low profile shape to
332580	it as well so I'll do my traditional
334170	iPhone size comparison although with the
337860	ht1 HTC One coming soon I might be doing
340980	away with that pretty soon so at its
342270	thinnest point it's actually a little
343770	thinner than an iPhone 4 and then at the
345780	thickest point up on the top it is
347640	significantly thicker than an iPhone 4
349710	so it has kind of a curvy is sort of
352500	angular angular shape to it overall you
355080	can actually see I'll show you guys
356580	right here up close if you want to see
358940	how much the buttons actually need to be
363000	depressed that is not to say sad but
365550	pressed down in order to actuate them
368010	one thing I missed about the layout is
369600	they've added little bumps on the W key
371460	so this allows you to more easily find
373860	your way back to them I personally don't
375720	find something like that that helpful
377040	because my landmarks are usually more to
379260	do with the positioning of my spacebar
381240	and my shift and then I can find my way
382860	back to the WASD but if you have trouble
384960	finding it in the dark then that's
386700	something that you can definitely
389310	benefit from now I'm going to go ahead
391260	and plug it in and we'll be back in a
392370	moment so there are only a few things
394320	that are really left we've got it
395640	plugged in now you can see the backlight
397229	but we're going to turn the lights off
398310	to show it to you in more detail
399750	so the SteelSeries key is used to
401250	control backlight brightness as well as
402960	your media keys volume up volume down
404580	all that good stuff and they have riad
407490	'add the diagonal keys over here so they
410190	had taken them away on some keyboard and
412350	then a bunch of people are upset so they
413880	have now brought them back if you wanted
415710	the diagonal Keys back then now you have
419190	them it does support up to 20
421860	simultaneous button presses which is
424590	sort of an anti ghosting type feature
426510	that prevents you from accidentally
428730	triggering random extra events which is
431040	what ghosting actually refers to most
433200	gaming keyboards do have this feature
434670	but 20 is pretty aggressive especially
436290	for a USB model and one thing that's
439080	kind of cool about it as well is they
440760	have reduced the width of the keyboard a
442620	little bit by narrowing the gaps that
444750	you usually find between the three
447030	different groupings of keys on the
449130	keyboard itself so it makes it still
451440	have a very large layout so you've still
454560	got extra keys at the top and on the
456480	side but without being sort of
458100	extraordinarily wide like something like
460560	a g15 gen1 which is sort of like that
462870	that first weird sort of lots of macros
465960	gaming keyboard all that I'd like that
467370	screen on the top and all that the wrist
469350	rest is a little bit longer than usual
471060	so when you're resting on the home row
472380	you're going to find yourself right
474000	around here so there you go I personally
477360	find that more comfortable it's one of
478590	the things I like about the 7g and just
480450	like about a lot of the other keyboards
481860	that are out there is very very short
483240	wrist rests and I think that pretty much
485190	wraps it up so I'm going to run around
486390	and turn off some lights and we'll show
488010	you guys the eight different levels of
491070	backlighting that are available on it
492690	there's still a window open so there's
494580	still some light in here but we're going
496440	to go ahead and step it down one by one
504790	so it still built it's off now there we
508210	go and I think that's pretty much it
