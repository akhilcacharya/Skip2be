1800	[Music]
4850	the arc MIDI r2 by fractal design
7470	features massive air flow and highly
9570	flexible liquid cooling support click
11340	now to learn more welcome to my unboxing
13290	and overview of the first time we've
15690	seen a new organ Amish ape from me onyx
19529	this is the AV or 8200 from me onyx
23369	which I guess was pretty much pretty
27480	much implied at this point in time and
28830	this is the first time they've done an
31289	ambidextrous mouse so up until now all
34110	we've really seen is that Berg anomic
36239	right-handed shape from them whether
38010	it's the Neos 8200 Neos 5000 or 3200 or
42809	2200 or whatever whatever neo says
45149	they've released have all been kind of
46469	the same shape now we've got a redesign
49260	so it's using the same premium 8200 dpi
52320	laser sensor that they're using in the
54510	Nao's 8200 except of course for the
57390	redesigned shape so they've got a
58770	braided cable here with gold plating on
60660	the outside of the connector which as
62039	you guys probably know if you've watched
64019	my videos before it does not do anything
66180	but actually what's important is the
67860	gold plating on the inside on the
69450	context that can give you a
70950	longer-lasting USB connector so it can
73770	survive more plugs and unplugs so
76229	braided cables about as long as you'd
77759	need fit to be for a mouse I'm going to
79860	go ahead and plug it into my handy-dandy
81810	tablet right here so you guys can see
83610	the illumination on the mouse so on the
86700	left-hand side we've got what would
88680	typically be the back and forward
90299	buttons that you'd find on it on your
92040	typical gaming mouse and then on the
94500	right hand side yes we've got exactly
96570	the same thing so it's an ambidextrous
98670	shape and a completely ambidextrous
100680	design it doesn't matter if you hold it
102570	with the left hand or the right hand
104100	you're going to have thumb buttons but
105810	I'd say are probably most correctly
108240	positioned as thumb buttons and less
111600	correctly positioned as pinky buttons
113520	and it's more to do with just having the
115710	option to have thumb buttons on either
117390	side and less to do with it being sort
119520	of something that you can perfectly
121170	press with your pinky without too much
123299	difficulty
124170	you've also of course got left and right
126299	buttons as well as an illuminated mouse
128068	wheel I'm just going to go ahead and
129270	take another crack at plugging this in
131129	apparently
131760	tablet had a hissy fit last time I did
133590	it and then you've got two more
135209	programmable buttons up here that you
136650	can adjust within the my Onyx software
138930	there we go we've got it running now so
140730	there's a 32-bit 72 megahertz ARM
142860	processor inside with 128 kilobytes of
145500	onboard memory so you can actually store
147180	your profiles on the mouse this is a
148860	feature I think we kind of take for
150030	granted these days but still not all
151890	mice actually have it so there you go
154980	something to consider on the bottom we
156750	find the usual slippy pad so at the top
159090	and bottom of the mouse nice large one
161549	so they should take longer to wear out
163290	than sort of your more average
165030	implementation now me onyx calls the
167129	finish on the mouse soft touch rubber
169440	coated surface I wouldn't really call it
171599	very rubbery I would definitely call it
173790	soft touch but it doesn't have quite the
175530	same grip that you might expect from a a
177480	rubberized finish and then the last
179730	thing that I wanted to mention is that
180900	the included lighting effects are
182819	completely customizable so you can
185159	change it up to sixteen point seven
186629	million colors so there's our BG LED
189000	lighting but it's not only behind the my
190859	onyx logo but also behind the scroll
193799	wheel so thank you for checking out my
196139	unboxing and overview of the EV R or
199379	however they want to spell that Eddy or
201620	have your 8,200 from me onyx don't
205290	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
206549	from unboxings reviews and other
207720	computer videos like the video if you
209129	liked it dislike it if you disliked it
210750	and if you did dislike it maybe leave a
212129	comment and tell me why and maybe if you
214019	liked it leave a comment and tell me why
215810	or talk about the mouse that's fine too
