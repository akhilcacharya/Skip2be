60	one line is tech tips video - keyboards
2520	is it a showdown no it's actually not
5910	but I'm going to highlight what these
7710	keyboards do differently from each other
9660	and what they do differently from the
11010	rest of the keyboards on the market
12870	treat that like button down there like
14969	the big red button that you see in a
16680	movie or video game and press it if
18990	you'd like to see a video on the r9 390x
31460	freshbooks
32579	is the super simple invoicing solution
34649	that lets you get organized save time
36780	and get paid faster click now to try for
39600	free let's start with the strife from
42809	corsair first off i need to check out
44850	these two videos from linus if you
47070	haven't seen them yet there are his
49079	reviews on the corsair k70 and the
51480	corsair k70 RGB they're very important
55050	confer comparative reasons because the
57239	k70 is currently one hundred and ten
59730	dollars on newegg.com and the MSRP of
64229	the strafe is also one hundred ten
66450	dollars that price could change but
68130	they're the same for now the k70 and the
71189	strafe both have Cherry MX switches they
73860	both have USB pass throughs they both
75930	have textured and contoured key cabs for
78090	a few certain keys although they're
80130	different ones the strafe leans more
82320	towards MOBA they both have 100%
84810	anti-ghosting technology and they both
86880	have enhanced easy access multimedia
89520	controls so what's different
92189	the k70 has a wrist rest the k7 T's
94740	multimedia controls are amazing the
96960	volume control has a wonderful metal
98520	scroll wheel that feels great to operate
100439	and most of controls have their own
101939	dedicated button for easy access the
104460	strafe is mostly based around a function
107189	key outside of just brightness and a
109530	lock button the k70 has an amazing
111990	aluminum construction and it looks great
114119	it adds a lot to the structural rigidity
116009	of the keyboard and the strafe does not
118530	have that it's mostly plastic
119880	construction but is it all bad news no
122969	not at all this traif has some really
124590	cool stuff
125369	the k70 doesn't have the hardware inside
127350	it in order to work with q software
129508	which enables users to program each key
131760	with automated macros
133470	this comes from the k70 RGB but that has
136830	a huge price increase the other thing
138840	that it inherits from the RGB is an
140820	enhanced lighting controller letting
142830	modes on the k70 were maybe a bit rather
145350	boring but the strafe has six unique
147420	lighting effects built-in and the
149010	ability for the user to craft their own
151080	this also includes downloading lighting
153510	themes off the corsair gaming comm
155610	website and it's not just a better
158070	lighting controller behind your keys is
160260	a red backplate which will enhance the
162450	quality of your back red lighting
164160	effects pretty cool moving on we have
166980	the MX board 6.0 from cherry this is a
169260	fairly standard looking keyboard the
171060	beautiful aluminum housing is coated so
173160	your oily hands won't ruin it which is
175140	great and the awesome magnetic wrist
177870	rest clicks in very easily is a great
180090	size and feels very comfy but outside of
182940	those things and some slightly shorter
184860	than normal key caps it looks fairly
186900	standard at first one technology that
188730	Jerry put into this board and as of this
190680	point doesn't really seem to interested
192720	into giving to other people is their RK
195510	technology also known as real key the
198120	goal of real key is reducing the lag
200160	within the keyboard from about 20
201900	milliseconds for a key press to one
203700	millisecond and a mechanical version of
206370	switch D bouncing all of this is
208440	compared to the standard matrix scanning
210510	method what the hell am I talking about
213209	well every time that you press a key
215160	your keyboard has to figure out that you
217470	pressed it and which one it was the
219330	matrix scanning method checks all the
220890	pins on your board with a specific
222510	current and then directs all of that
225360	using a bunch of diodes back to the
227070	controller which then takes the X and
228810	y-axis and then it can figure out which
230489	one you press real key technology
232500	doesn't use diodes and connects
234000	everything together directly to the
235739	controller but this time a unique
238049	voltage is sent to each pin and the
240420	controller will use the final total
242250	voltage to determine which switch was
244470	pressed down this in theory is a huge
248640	improvement and I think it's super cool
250260	don't get me wrong but I didn't
253140	personally really notice a difference I
255060	would like to do more testing here but
257760	that would require more scientific
259529	equipment than I currently have my hands
261120	on so maybe we can look into that in the
263550	future but it's not a huge
266560	very drastically noticeable change in
269260	conclusion the keyboard battle is
271360	ever-expanding and two new strong
273730	players have entered the game they're
275830	both on the cherry team but they have
277419	their own unique offerings one with
279190	fantastic light and control and the
281169	other is faster than ever which do you
283900	choose mass drop has another one of
286300	their pretty killer deals going on today
