0	thanks an ass drop for sponsoring our
1650	content here at CES 2018 you can get the
4650	Sennheiser HD 5 8 x headphones at the
7140	link below for just one $49.99 so we're
10830	here in the Corsair suite where the
12780	theme this year is fewer wires or unplug
17820	and play oh like I had enough of a
21660	headache already from being sick and
22949	that just made it like 10 times worse so
24960	we're gonna start with the k63
27119	corsair now has a wireless mechanical
31410	keyboard with Cherry MX switches just
33559	reds for now that is fully Wireless and
37350	they are claiming that even with their
39660	out-of-the-box default 66% backlighting
42660	intensity can last for up to 15 hours
46050	it's available in two different colors
47610	this more pure blue and then a special
50219	ice blue to match the Corsair one and
52379	they are claiming near wired levels of
55710	performance with one millisecond of
58140	latency at 2.4 gigahertz with their own
60719	special dongle and about seven
62940	milliseconds of latency over Bluetooth
64920	now like many wireless peripherals you
67560	can also plug it in and use it wired if
69630	you want for those of you wondering it
72000	should last about 75 hours without the
74939	backlighting enabled so if you want to
77479	extend your session you just got to go
81720	ahead and hit the session extend button
83520	it's 10 keyless and the reason for that
86220	is that they were going for kind of a
88200	whole solution thing here it is meant to
90869	load into an updated version of Corsairs
93900	previous lap dog product that to me
96390	makes a lot more sense so this guy right
99420	here you just snap the keyboard in
101460	there's no allen keys there's no screws
103530	there's no nothing like that
104670	boom you're ready to go it works
106829	wirelessly it's got memory foam on the
108720	bottom that's actually from the about 20
111180	minutes I've been sitting here not too
113100	shabby at all and it includes a mouse
115110	mat that's a cloth style mouse mat
116850	unfortunately not swappable at this time
119009	as well as a rubberized grip for the
121049	wrist rest that I actually didn't really
122850	find I touched much in more of a gaming
124950	position but definitely enhanced the
127439	typing feel now let's move on to
130470	Corsairs Wireless Gaming Mouse this is
132870	the first
133650	time they've done one of these and the
135000	story from them is that they've been
136230	waiting for the right technology so just
138599	like the keyboard it boasts one
140340	millisecond latency and they're saying
142890	24 hours of battery life with all of the
145470	RGB bells and whistles enabled so there
148319	are three zones and it's got swap a
149909	little grips I believe there are three
151500	in the box and it's also got this kind
153329	of unique texture it's kind of like a
154680	dimpled texture that they say was
156060	inspired by sports equipment like golf
158159	clubs for the sensor it's running a
159840	Pixar at 33 67 which they say they
162269	customized for Corsair so it's up to
164299	16,000 dpi if you're into that sort of
166829	thing and it is a perfect mate for their
169440	mm 1000 mouse mat which includes a
172889	wireless charging corner in the top so
175530	with the special edition of this guy you
178170	can actually just pop your mouse up to
179700	the top right corner of your mousepad
180930	and it will fully charge in about two
184019	hours and change because they're using
186870	the Qi standard you can actually use the
188900	g-spot like I couldn't believe they
192120	called it that in the presentation to
193680	charge other devices such as your phone
195659	and they include this little dongle in
196859	case you have a phone that doesn't
198209	include wireless charging although
199739	personally I don't really see the
200790	practicality of having like a weird puck
202379	on the side of my mouse pad well I'm
203910	trying to use it your mileage may vary
205440	it weighs about a hundred and
206849	twenty-eight grams so it's among the
208590	heavier mice out there but from using it
211319	here in the suite the performance is
212970	pretty well sweet so pricing for the new
216329	mouse which they're calling the dark
217889	core is $79.99 plus 10 for the wireless
220739	charging version then you're gonna need
222180	another $79.99 for that wireless
224519	charging mouse pad as for the keyboard
226650	this one's actually really reasonable
229519	199 for their wireless keyboard then
232440	another $59.99 I believe it is for the
235859	lap board dock and then in some regions
237959	they're gonna have it available for $10
240359	less in a bundle I'm really liking that
242639	much better pricing and just overall a
244500	much better form factor compared to what
246780	they had done in the past so it pretty
250829	much wraps it up for Corsair guys thanks
