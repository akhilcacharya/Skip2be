0	there are two kinds of companies
2330	followers and leaders some keyboard
6420	manufacturers approach the problem of
8840	ergonomics by taking your standard
11190	QWERTY keyboard and sprinkling in a
14340	little bend here in some separation
16770	there but leaders they have true courage
20580	they use first principle thinking to
23789	build new products from the ground up
25859	and the safe type keyboard turns the
29220	whole idea of a keyboard on its side and
33469	then down normal and then on its other
36809	side
37530	but is this 290 dollar command center
43559	the answer to your RS I Christ or are
47640	these guys coming at this from
49590	completely the wrong angle
53540	[Music]
59890	cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
63350	cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
67700	tempered glass side panel check it out
70189	now at the link below okay let's just
74330	get this out of the way the safe types
76700	layout is pretty unconventional the
80060	Alpha portion of the keyboard has been
82250	split into two equal halves and rotated
86060	making it the most 3d keyboard we've
89750	ever tested more about why in a moment
92630	first let's look at the third section
95060	which contains the cursor controls a
97840	number pad and media buttons and some of
102170	these are super handy what a great use
105259	of otherwise empty middle space I'm
107990	looking at you Kinney sis just be
110720	careful to not accidentally hit the
113479	shutdown hotkey during the season finale
116479	of scrapyard Wars let's get this out of
119420	the way early - this thing looks weird
122780	but it's actually a lot faster to get
126530	used to then you'd probably think all of
129500	the keys are in their usual least
132379	relatively speaking usual spots and the
135530	s and J keys are even bumpier than
138379	normal to help keep you anchored on the
140900	home row the only kind of novel key
144170	placement is the extra backspace key
146840	that shifts all the workload from your
149420	right pinky to being able to split it
151430	with your left thumb and a thumbs up for
153950	that one another thing that looks weird
157010	but is for a reason is the legend why
161659	are some of the symbols all rotating
164720	backwards aha well hold on to your
168830	carpals my friends because although safe
172220	type recommends that users be proficient
174830	touch typists before purchasing one of
177379	their keyboards and we agree you really
181069	cannot see what the heck you're pressing
183530	from a natural position they realize
186740	that some keys are used so infrequently
189830	but it might help
191240	to be able to take a peek at them and
193460	that is why they include this high-vis
196940	vest and hard hat in the box
199490	for the dedicated spotter that you'll
202010	need to help you find your way around or
204650	down almost keep going just kidding
208340	the real solution is the key caps with
212060	the reverse lettering and built-in
214760	rearview mirrors obviously they're
218000	adjustable so you can aim them at the
219710	function and number keys or my favorite
222110	the ctrl and alt keys so you can still
225290	do all your favorite columns but like
228590	this not like this power goes like this
232360	protip you can actually also use them to
234860	keep an eye out for your boss during
236810	not-safe-for-work lunch breaks but let's
240380	get seriously here what the hell were
243140	they thinking designing a keyboard like
245060	this well it turns out that there are
247700	three damaging postures associated with
251360	typical keyboard use all in their
253790	deviation which happens when your wrists
255920	go like this extension which is when
259399	your wrists do that and pronation which
262910	is when your hands are like oh okay that
266630	last one actually doesn't look bad but
269150	it actually causes the two major bones
271550	in your forearms to scissor pinching
274820	nerves and blood vessels save type
277850	claims to address all of these issues
280040	without transferring the stress to other
283190	parts of your body like the neck and
285110	shoulders I say your mileage may vary
289340	somewhat because depending on some other
292640	factors you may actually end up in a
295370	worse posture than you would have with
298190	your good old fashioned 104 key because
301250	here's the thing it's clear that the
303890	vertical hand position is going to keep
306440	your arms from pronating so scratch that
309380	one off the list but all in there
311660	deviation that depends more on your desk
314870	setup if it's too high your wrists are
318110	going to be above your elbows no good
321050	and if you can't lower your desk what's
323870	your
324150	going to have to do is raise your chair
326190	I ended up with my feet dangling also
329700	not ideal on the bright side you can
332700	solve that with a couple of blocks under
334800	the back of the board so maybe a v2 will
337260	come with feet but it's not something
339870	that's included in the box
341610	and finally as for extension save type
345360	says the most orthopedically neutral
347670	position is achieved by starting with
350160	your arms at your sides and then using
352290	only your biceps to lift the arms until
355290	they're perpendicular to the ground but
357570	then you've got to hold your arms up
360510	like that the whole time you're typing
363420	who wants to do that I'd probably end up
366990	with my elbows on the chairs arm rests
369120	after 2 minutes and that's just going to
371670	bend my wrists more so it is this
374580	ergonomic keyboard for you well if you
377790	have the right setup like a standing
380430	desk or one with a dropped keyboard tray
383160	then the health benefits could be real
385680	but the membrane key switches are pretty
388320	mushy moving your hand from the outside
390840	to the inside is crazy inefficient and
394050	the build quality is average for like 15
399210	years ago it kind of comes down to
401490	whether you want to invest the extra $60
404130	and the learning time into an advantage
407010	- or if you need an ergonomic keyboard
409860	that you can type proficiently on right
412500	this minute I mean it's got a 30-day
414480	money-back guarantee it works on Windows
416400	and Mac is available in North America
418170	and Europe so you know why am I even
419760	bothering with this conclusion did you
421710	just it go for it it's just money
423600	like whatever it's it's after 6:00 I'm
426180	time to go home it's not a real chair
