30	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2790	something that we actually detailed
4859	pretty reasonably well during our CES
7680	coverage but I'm extremely excited to
10290	have it properly hands-on so that we can
13500	check out everything from the retail
15030	packaging to all that other good stuff
16230	so this is the orb weaver from razer and
19529	it features a package with not one not
22710	two but three seals in the top that I
26250	now get to break with my knife this is
29099	the first time that I have seen one of
31619	these game pads that is fully mechanical
34200	and not just fully mechanical but
37079	mechanical Cherry MX blues so my
40140	personal favorite kind of mechanical
43230	we're going to go ahead open up the box
45780	where we find presumably I haven't seen
48210	it yet but presumably as always razors
50460	immaculate attention to detail when it
52350	comes to their packaging look at that
53910	even the inside of the outer shell box
55860	is black because that is how they roll
59489	so on the bottom we find a couple of
62550	things we find the gold plated USB
63930	connector would have liked to see a
65610	braided cable here so that's a little
67260	bit unfortunate but it's up to you guys
70229	doesn't increase performance or anything
71700	it's just the kind of detail I would
73350	have expected razor to include we've got
75360	some Razer stickers which everyone likes
77490	I think at least people who like the
79320	Razer logo would like Razer stickers I
80970	like the Razer logo although I don't
83640	think I've ever put Razer stickers on
85049	something congratulations there's no
86909	turning back and there's a baby crying
88619	we will be back in a moment
90920	sorry about that guys he bumped his head
93180	so I'm taking over for a little bit he's
96509	feeling better already but I just want
98250	to show you guys all the details of the
100259	orb-weaver itself we've got it plugged
101610	in so you can see the brilliant green
103680	LED lighting effects in fact you'll be
105509	able to see them a little bit better if
106590	we kill the house lights and you check
108509	these things out
110540	check them out just like the Black Widow
115140	ultimate 2013 the lighting is extremely
118530	vibrant and very green I've encountered
120509	other backlit switches that just don't
123030	have that same that same depth to the
126090	green color but yeah the Black Widow
128038	ultimate 2013 and this one are very very
130949	vibrant so let's get the lights back and
132599	show you guys we have
133950	when tea fully programmable keys so
136260	using Razer synapse 2.0 you can change
138930	the functionality to whatever you want
141000	including macros and because it's
143550	cloud-based your profiles go with you on
145770	the fly all you have to do is log into
148170	your synapse profile and you're good to
150090	go over here we have a again mechanical
154560	analog stick a thumb rest as well as an
158040	additional button here that can act as a
159840	shift giving you access to up to 40
163489	programmable keys if you hold shift and
166290	press it versus if you don't hold shift
168090	and press it you can put in different
169440	functionality it's also extremely
171269	customizable in terms of the length so
173610	you've got two pieces here just going to
175500	sit him down there's all pin right here
177630	that you pull out and you can release
179970	this palm rest so that it can be in
182280	either down up or free moving mode
186360	giving you the ability to just kind of
188130	have it float with you as you move your
189569	hand back and forth and slick and I have
191970	already each tried this before but when
194580	you expand it to the max so using this
197640	clip right here to expand this piece
199859	there we go
201000	let's just show you guys that in detail
202829	baby as the backdrop there we go
205620	all the way and this clip right here to
208380	expand the thumb or contract it
210660	whichever you prefer you can have it big
213450	enough for Slick's hands where you can
214950	see my hands are look ridiculous on it
216959	and I can't even reach the keys hardly
218880	versus if I put it all the way in we
221760	could have it see this is where I was
223079	going with this okay maybe not quite
225510	small enough for baby hands but pretty
228900	darn close right you a gamer
231720	there you go there you go champ alright
235200	let's see if I'm missing anything else
236609	about it so we got Razer synapse 2.0
238650	instantaneous switching between eight
240390	different key maps oh that's right
242640	okay so there's an indicator over here
245280	that allows you to switch between
246630	different key maps backlit keyboard
248519	adjustable hansom and programmable a
250620	tweed oh yeah it's an eight way
251970	directional thumb pad I should have
253230	mentioned that and I just want to talk a
255299	little bit about the overall build
257639	quality of this guy it is unbelievable
261720	so it has that same feel that high
265440	quality mechanical keyboards have theirs
267630	zero flex to the device on the keyboard
270360	itself I mean I can't I can't demo flex
273000	because there is no flex and the Cherry
276660	MX blue switches feel extremely
279120	responsive and have that satisfying
282960	sound that you expect from well Cherry
285330	MX blue switches the rubber pads on the
287700	bottom are using a high quality rubber
289350	grip so it's not going to go anywhere
291030	while you're gaming and we were actually
292620	having this conversation off-camera
294330	between me and the production crew here
296340	where we figure you know what probably
298050	one of the reasons that the packaging is
299760	not quite what you'd normally see from
301650	Razer and you know the cords not braided
304590	is because this is an extremely
306030	expensive device to manufacture compared
308820	to competing products out there like
310500	something like a Nostromo for example
312900	because it uses mechanical key switches
314850	the cost of making it goes up immensely
318270	so thank you for checking out my
319650	unboxing and first look at the Razer
