0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to
2220	you by Dollar Shave Club get a great
3929	shave for just a few dollars a month
5220	that dollarshaveclub.com slash line is
7109	linked below so we're here in the
9480	Corsair suite where they are going more
12179	tempered glass and more RGB than ever
14700	before what a freaking surprise so
17190	behind me I've actually got a case that
22080	includes no RGB lighting whatsoever
24510	this is the Obsidian 500 d and i'm just
27510	gonna put it in front of that one for
29400	reasons that I will reveal quite shortly
31320	this is Corsairs first case with
33840	integrated native USB type-c in the
36690	front including that 20 pin connector on
39210	the inside that is supported on newer
41370	motherboards it's got a tempered glass
43079	side panel it's got support for two hard
45600	drives and three SSDs on the back of the
47430	motherboard tray and water cooling
49230	support is actually pretty wide open as
51870	well it can take up to a triple 120
55170	millimeter in the front and a dual 140
58410	millimeter in the top and part of that
60359	is thanks to its extremely efficient
64129	that's fine
65580	extremely efficient use of its internal
67470	space so it's got a lot of room up here
69090	for a big radiator and fins and then
72090	it's almost no clearance between the
74010	motherboard and the power supply
75540	basement down here now this guy's going
78479	to be 149 or something along those lines
80729	and should be available pretty soon but
83640	honestly this isn't the one that I'm not
85200	excited about oh yeah there's a
86490	removable fan filter I'm not sure how it
91229	comes out but no removable fan filter so
94650	I'm just gonna put that aside be right
96570	back this is the sexy one so this would
104790	cost quite a bit more if it were to make
107490	it to market
108270	it's got curved tempered glass on the
111240	front just like the concept slate that
114240	we showed off last year slash did a
116340	video of quite recently it's showing off
118799	the vertical GPU mounting that is also
121500	available in its little brother and it
124170	is also planned to include Corsairs
127049	light loop RGB fans so the plan if it
130709	were to become a real product would also
132360	be to
132860	include a Corsair commander Pro so you
135020	can RG be affected up and estimated may
138350	be hypothetical pricing somewhere in the
140320	250 dollar range and for how good this
143660	thing looks it could be the case to beat
146690	if you're into mid towers with tempered
149120	glass an RGB but let's say you're not
151130	into RGB and you want to spend a lot of
152630	money course there has a new power
154340	supply for you it has been four years
156890	since the ax 1500 I and it finally has a
161120	big brother although it should be noted
162770	it's actually two centimeters shorter
164720	this is the ax 1600 I uses gallium
169340	nitride MOSFETs in order to achieve its
172060	astonishing 94% efficiency at 100% load
178040	that is four percent higher than the 80
179840	plus titanium spec so the reason Corsair
183020	hasn't done a successor to the 1500 I is
185390	that anything higher than that would
187400	trip a 120 volt North American breaker
190280	anyway well they got this thing so
192200	efficient that is only pulling seventeen
194600	hundred and thirty watts from the wall
196310	at a hundred percent load meaning that
198590	it won't trip your breaker whew
200660	it also comes with coursera link support
202880	and my favorite this was actually
205790	something that I suggested to course at
207650	one point why do you guys just have
210140	these stickers that you can't remove I
211820	was like can I get a new sticker waiting
213650	you why don't you just do magnet oh oh
215660	it's got magnetic magnetic logos you can
218720	put it on whatever way you want it comes
220400	with blue and red and white and then the
222410	stock is just the the traditional
224780	corsair matches everything gray this
227510	guy's going to be priced at for $99.99
233230	holy okay well uh thanks to Dollar Shave
