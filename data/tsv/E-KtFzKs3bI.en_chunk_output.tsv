5779	with its factory tuning and data center
8700	DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
11519	amazing choice for gamers and
13139	performance enthusiasts now I've looked
15990	at 10 keyless keyboards in the past but
18000	I'm a heavy number pad users so I've
19980	never really forced myself to use one
22439	for an extended period of time
23930	coolermaster was all like okay well
26730	we're gonna send you one but you have to
28439	actually use it so I said okay make sure
31830	it has brown switches on it and I'll
33300	consider it so they did so now I really
35340	have to try it but now if you don't know
37140	what a 10 keyless keyboard is then
38790	prepare yourself for a shock because
40710	it's missing a lot more than 10 keys
42690	versus a standard hundred and four key
44579	layout actually 17 keys because the
47160	number pad and all the other nearby keys
50730	are all not there the reason for this is
53610	that it's actually more ergonomic to
56039	have your mouse closer to the standard
58710	home row typing position than a standard
61140	keyboard allows the way most people end
63719	up compensating is either by typing too
66000	far to the left which causes strain or
67890	by moving their Mouse hand over too far
70200	to the right which also causes strain
71939	and this isn't marketing BS it's just
73860	fact the sacrifice that you make
76110	especially if like me you use your
77909	number pad a lot is that it's not there
79890	and especially at first I found myself
82189	reaching for that part of my keyboard a
84509	lot even little things like clicking on
86580	something and then trying to press the
88200	bottom right Enter key drove me bananas
89880	at the beginning so that's 10 keyless
92579	keyboards in general but I guess I
94320	should get into some specifics about the
96060	rapid eye from Coolermaster true to see
98280	M storms usual mo it's a solidly built
101070	mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX
102689	switches and a really pleasing matte
105090	black soft touch finish with laser
106799	etched keys it's got a full backlight in
109140	this case white we have five levels of
111509	brightness which you can adjust just
113220	like that and a few cool lighting modes
116130	that cool master is brending active
118619	lights including full illumination
121460	breathing two different types of
124079	reactive typing with or without a fade
127170	out and four different profiles that can
129628	be programmed and then recalled in just
132180	a few seconds
133370	so you can pick which keys you want
135260	illuminated I made a little squiggly
137120	line across the keyboard it's got media
139159	controls that can be accessed with a
140690	function modifier and one more cool
142940	feature something I've only seen a
144080	couple of times is that it's also got
146120	repeat rate control this is less useful
148909	for typing since it affects how fast a
151459	key that you're holding down will repeat
153829	on the screen so things get out of
155569	control pretty fast 1x is normal looks
157700	like this well 2 X looks like this 4 X
160280	looks like this and 8 X is just
161900	ridiculous but gaming is a different
165140	story and this will come in handy for
166730	commands that you want to execute
168440	repeatedly much faster than you can
171410	press the button repeatedly QuickTime
173629	events where you need to match the
174650	button hot bring it on
176629	alright so back to the 10 keyless
178310	experience as a whole for a bit I did
180980	almost immediately notice the
182810	improvement in my mouse and comfort for
184700	general computer use and for gaming even
187640	though for quite a while it weirded me
189560	out every time I took my hand off my
191569	mouse to press a key on the right side
192590	of the keyboard just be missing at least
195500	that's not an issue for gaming when
197090	really the left side of the keyboard is
198709	the only part that's in use so overall
201319	after my trial period I'm not quite
204260	ready to make the switch
205310	I think I'd need to pick up a USB
207260	mechanical number pad to use on the
209599	right side of my mouse something a lot
211669	of 10 keyless users who use number pads
213410	do and try that out a little bit before
215510	I commit but what I will say is I
217879	definitely liked the improved ergonomics
220250	of not feeling like my posture is either
223010	too wide or shifted too far to the left
226069	and if I was shopping for a 10 keyless
227900	today the rapid I would have my
229400	attention since Coolermaster is using
231620	genuine Cherry MX switches on this model
233660	and the build quality overall is nice
