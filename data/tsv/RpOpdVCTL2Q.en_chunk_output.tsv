60	today I'm gonna be doing a quick
1350	unboxing of the me onyx nails 5000 high
5190	performance gaming mouse it comes in a
7730	fantastic matte black box very
10260	minimalistic you basically got what it
12599	is what it's called and who makes it and
15900	what they're all about light years ahead
17580	of the game me onyx net let's see what
20070	else is on the packaging here yeah
21359	nothing on that side nothing on that
24330	side nothing on top nothing on the
27029	bottom we got some info on the back
28349	though so here's our model overview as
30330	well as our technical specifications so
32308	let's talk about some of the interesting
33510	features of this mouse in the overview
35730	here as well as the text box actually
38790	let's not do that let's open it up and
40260	then we'll talk about that later
41340	so it opens from the bottom well when
43739	it's sealed not just figures doesn't it
46320	guess I'll be needing my trusty unboxing
48510	knife the Spyderco knife by the way a
52559	lot of people ask me there we are
56309	got a little magnet there hold that
59219	closed here we go a star has been born
61649	so you guys can read the little blurb if
63719	you want I'm not gonna read it out loud
65330	you can pause the video or don't pause
68490	the video here we go let's keep going
69869	with the nose so you can see right away
72090	that this Mouse includes a feature that
73680	the naio is 3200 it does not and that is
77400	a removable adjustable weight system so
80580	you can see they come in a little
81479	container here there's your weights they
83490	got a little me onyx logo on them
85820	alright we'll have a look at how that
87570	works the moment and very minimalistic
89790	packaging again you're expected to
91470	download the latest drivers off the me
93990	onyx website which is what I always
95759	encourage you guys to do anyway okay
101240	something's got to say for herself in
103170	here installation full speed USB Gaming
105899	Mouse LED lights will light up and the
108600	mouse is ready to use you can customize
110790	it by downloading the software and the
112259	way tuning system the weights are placed
113579	horizontally on both sides next to the
115110	sensor for more balanced feeling
117240	interesting
117960	simply remove the two hatches by tapping
119640	the small buttons forward and the
121680	warranty is two years don't try and
123329	repair your product just contact their
124920	support here if you have any issues all
128250	right so let's pull up the nails 5000
130759	put that packaging aside for a minute
133290	right
133650	we're gonna be trying this on the
135569	professed 380 here so the first thing
138930	I'm gonna do with this products I'm
140280	going to have a look at the plug that's
141689	a gold-plated very very nice quality USB
145890	cable so you can see by the gorgeous
149670	sleeving on here as well as the
151769	flexibility of the cable that it's using
154590	very high quality wires inside so that's
157799	a very good thing and the gold-plated
159359	here's here's a common misconception
161269	gold is not the best conductor that is
163799	not why it is used in this application
165530	Gold is used because it is soft its
168120	malleable so and it's also very
171980	corrosion resistant so when you plug it
174840	in you'll get it as good a connection as
176909	possible every time you won't get
178379	necessarily the same kind of connection
179879	you would with copper or silver but
182010	it'll be more consistent that's why so
184680	let's go ahead and plug that into my
186030	laptop here and hopefully the muffs will
190470	light up I've already installed the
191730	drivers in preparation for this unboxing
194220	so let's we'll start by just looking at
196560	the mouse as a whole I'm actually gonna
199139	get my chair I'm tired of standing so it
201930	lights up green right off the bat you
204180	can see we got a few different lights
205379	we've got our dpi and lights here so you
207780	can see those go up and down according
209159	to whatever dpi setting I'm using we've
211739	got a light on the mouse scroll wheel
213690	and then I scroll wheel actually okay
216389	we've got back and forward buttons which
218790	I am using now so it totally changed the
222389	page from what I wanted to be looking at
224250	we've got obviously the DPI adjuster
227549	buttons we've got a left and right click
229019	middle click as well as an onyx logo
231720	here the ergonomics of this mouse
233340	appear to be as far as I can tell so far
236510	identical to the nails three 200 which
240209	is right here next to it so I'm just
242489	gonna sort of double check that before I
246690	say for sure yeah those are though those
249540	are clearly the same and since I'm such
251370	a big fan of the ergonomics of this
253560	mouse you have to imagine that I'm a
255329	pretty big fan of the ergonomics on this
257190	one as well so here's the little things
259019	you slide forward - oh yeah
262310	really see how ZZ just click up there we
266090	go and from there you can put in as many
270410	weights as you please
271820	nice to open up let's load it up I do
274250	like a heavy Mouse and I love ones that
276260	come up in weight systems because nobody
278600	makes a heavy enough Mouse for me
280940	I'm ig9 at work is actually loaded up
283639	with as many weights as I can stuff in
285290	it and ice I settled for no weights on
288590	my Akari at home just because it doesn't
291650	have a weight system ok quite fair how
297290	these go in here actually mm-hmm maybe
302840	there ah there we go
304280	so you just got to slide it in just
306470	right so you can actually this is cool
309770	this is a really neat way of doing the
311180	weight system because you can balance
313490	the weight towards the back of the mouse
314990	you can balance the weight towards the
317000	front of the mouse it's quite a light
318860	Mouse without the weights but these are
321050	actually pretty substantial weights let
322610	me just see if they're marked or how
324500	much they weigh each but it's it's
326150	definitely a noticeable half today they
327919	are they're 5 gram weights each I'm
332060	gonna actually double check and see if
333530	they're all the same for I verify that
336080	for you guys yeah this one's 5 grams as
337760	well see the next one 5 grams so in
342530	total by adding 8 5 gram weights I'm
344720	adding 40 grams to the mouse and then
347990	I'm gonna go ahead and close that back
349490	up what's the left one and see if that
355100	goes in you're going go clicks in like
359570	that and then here's the right one there
366020	you have it okay
368510	so now that's got some weight to it so
371860	quite a bit heavier than the 3200 now
374630	especially if you try to try to lift it
376639	up straight off the table all right
379340	let's see what else that me onyx has to
382039	say about themselves with the narrows
383630	5000 before we keep moving on here
386980	tex-mex truly ergonomic design yeah we
389840	got that much figured out grip friendly
391820	rubber coating love the rubber coating
393650	seven buttons seven programmable button
396440	errs really focus on this text properly
400190	come on come on camera you can do it
402229	there we go in game profiles which
403880	configurable dpi up to five thousand
406100	forty dpi so that may be worth at five
408260	thousand name comes from six integrated
410479	LEDs adjustable polling rate 128
413540	kilobytes built-in memory large Teflon
415639	feet balanced weight tuning system up to
417260	forty grams which we figured out already
418699	um so this for pretty much aware of
421190	compatible of all kinds of surfaces
422950	squat surface quality analyzer tool so
425630	we're gonna try that before we finish
427040	this video here adjustable lift distance
429050	that's a cool feature so you can adjust
431870	how much lift distance before it stops
434810	detecting the surface below it up to
436790	12,000 frames per second with tracking
438710	speed of five point one meters per
440150	second okay that's fair bit more here
442430	and that's pretty much it warranty
444979	information which we have already
446060	covered okay so let's open up the
448039	software now which hopefully works nice
453590	driver software they've also got another
457070	feature that they just added with this
458600	version of the driver which um let me
462349	see if I can find a little blurb about
464660	it and they asked 5,000 what do they
468919	call it so this is in version 1.1 7 and
471470	that is angle snapping so when making
473780	horizontal it's horizontal or vertical
476740	movements you naturally cannot make a
480080	straight line so it senses these
482389	deviations from what you're trying to do
484099	algorithmically and corrects them you
485479	can actually adjust how much or how
488180	little correction is done not you can
493820	extend okay if they've added extended
495770	color customization options as well as
498560	something about avoiding tracking loss
500150	with the squat tool so we haven't
501770	actually managed to launch the driver
503450	software yet it's good doesn't it oh
505639	there it is tidy so there we go we've
508550	launched it so sensor performance let's
511340	say I want to try I want to try that
512659	squat tool first so and a live surface
516200	here we go the surface quality analyzer
518120	tools a feature that analyzes the
519799	surface
520250	the mouse just okay pressed analyze
522559	service making sure that you okay so
524959	move the mouse over the surface area oh
527899	okay
528920	making sure to cover as much as possible
531560	of the surface okay there you have it it
537379	is nine out of ten done okay done there
543680	it is okay now just for contrast why
546500	don't we try analyzing the surface of my
549350	ugly horrible blue tablecloth thing
554569	okay so let's analyze the surface of
556490	this you're going to cover as much of
558350	the surface area as possible so it's
561139	about a ten second test and it's done oh
568519	that is an acceptable surface okay last
571550	but not least just for curiosity's sake
574100	I want to try a steel series 5l okay
578480	done let's try one more time analyzed
582139	circus analyzed surface okay move around
584809	on the 5l try that out let's see what
589129	let's see what my onyx is surface
591319	analyzer thinks of the five L analyzing
594709	oh oh it does not like the five L one
598399	bit interesting interesting okay so
602329	let's see very quickly what kind of
604220	adjustments we've got in here you can
605629	change all your mouse settings you can
607040	change your double click and scroll
608240	speeds you can change pointer
609980	acceleration you can you disable it
611629	entirely you got your polling rates
613430	here's your sensor performance where you
615050	can change dpi settings angle snapping
617300	pointer speed lift distance okay as well
620959	as you running the surface quality
622879	analyzer test you can change your color
625129	settings let's have a yellow mouth shall
626629	we let's see what happens there you go
628610	yellow Mouse Ben now let's have a okay
633350	there we go now let's have a peek nose
634699	apply BAM nice love it ok macro settings
639470	takes a moment to apply those settings
641449	so the real macro settings so you can
645709	record macros as well as some support
648319	and Fussel thank you for checking out my
