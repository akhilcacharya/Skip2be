6770	welcome to my unboxing of a pretty sweet
10110	product this is a cheap and I'm not even
13320	gonna mince words this is a cheap USB
16160	gamepad that happens to look exactly
19670	like an SNES gamepad so if you play any
22800	emulators or if you play games on any
24930	emulators like say for example if you
26699	have the physical cartridges in your
28980	possession and like your SNES doesn't
31410	work so you download the rom of that
33570	particular one or like you recover it
36090	somehow with like whatever you legally
38370	own the rom only so if you play games on
41550	emulators legally then you might get one
43980	of these because it plugs into your pc
45750	via USB it has a d-pad select start our
50329	ylx
51510	a and b opening it up now there is
55590	nothing inside the box so it is
57899	driverless which means you basically
59340	plug the thing into the thing and run
61620	the thing and here we go so I'm gonna go
66659	ahead and you know I'm gonna you know be
70049	fairly critical as much as I can here so
73260	the USB length is about a Linus arm span
76049	which means well it's a little bit more
77580	which means it's about six feet long
78840	okay there's your standard USB 2
81270	connector alright
82830	the overall feel of it it's not it's not
86310	quite right you know the buttons don't
88020	have quite the same awesomeness that the
90540	original SNES controller does so I mean
93570	you still have to get an SNES controller
95460	if you really want it to feel like
96869	you're the real thing but the ergonomics
99689	are good the piston the buttons are all
103530	in the right place and I think this is
106619	fairly self-explanatory so it's a cheap
109670	SNES connector Marv not connector no
113670	there's no SNES connector it's a cheap
115320	SNES controller that has a USB connector
117899	that you can use to play your legit SNES
120990	rooms and thank you for checking out
123600	this unboxing and you know what let's
125640	find out exactly how driverless it is
127380	here we go let's plug it into test bench
129959	here or not a test bench this is the
132270	video editing piece
133190	you're in a detective's laboratory okay
140690	here we go oh that's my email you guys
143780	don't need that ah
145100	then we've got control panel here we go
148100	that's detecting to access 11 keys
150980	gamepad that is about as generic as a
153200	description could possibly be so here we
157850	go hardware and sound oh man I hate the
161930	way they've rearranged this okay let's
164030	try this
164720	ah oh you know what let's go with game
168580	really oh oh oh brilliant so this
172040	picture is pretty yeah explanatory setup
174740	ah properties here we go let's see if it
178040	works
178340	ha right left rather right down left
182000	okay this all works so I can finally
184550	enter Sabine's or sapiens however you
187190	pronounce his name his blitzes properly
189170	cuz I'm using a Logitech gamepad now
191270	that really doesn't allow me to do that
192650	so then we've got button 3 4 1 2 5 6 9
198590	10 what happened ones are there 1 2 3 4
204080	5 6 7 a there 8 how is this an 11 button
206720	gamepad you know what I guess there's
208100	more solder points inside so there you
209750	go guys if you wanted to add like an
211310	extraneous like you know sure you can
215090	button there's something like that then
216709	that you would be able to do that
217880	potentially so thank you for checking
