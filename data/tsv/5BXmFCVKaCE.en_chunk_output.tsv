89	it used to be that to everyone but tiny
2669	niche companies platforms that you could
5819	use to operate a keyboard and mouse on
7890	the couch
8580	we're a solution in search of a problem
12389	but whether we have steam linked to
15120	thank for this or something else
17100	corsair and razer both reached out
19949	asking us to evaluate their couch
22170	keyboard mouse gaming products so here
25980	we go
35039	cooller masters master case maker five
37780	features they're freeform modular system
40510	allowing you to customize adjust and
42579	upgrade make it yours at the link in the
45399	video description the Corsair lap dog
47829	comes in two pieces with the knurled
49930	allen key that you'll need for assembly
51729	tucked into a little notch in the bottom
53769	one pull that out then put it aside that
56649	cushion attaches to the bottom with
58180	magnets later this is the meat and
61479	potatoes of the lap dog a plastic backed
64330	brushed aluminum topped board intended
67300	to act as a comfortable platform for
69340	your full-size keyboard and mouse that
71950	sits across your knees though a spacer
74619	is included if you prefer a shorter 10
76690	kilos keyboard without a number pad you
79179	can use any mouse you want but official
81520	keyboard support is limited to Corsair
83500	zone K 65 and K 70 let's talk assembly
87700	plug your power brick and USB 3 cable in
90490	on the PC side cable management options
93280	are a little limited due to the 15-foot
95830	length limit that's imposed by the use
97569	of a passive cable then undo the four
100630	screws from the mousepad and the two
103090	screws from the top fascia that pulls
105250	double duty as a cable management cubby
107409	to hide the keyboards long USB cord that
109869	will be plugged into one of the two
111100	internal USB 3 ports there's another two
113590	on the outside and as a lock to keep the
117100	keyboard in place there are a couple of
119439	anchor points below to make this easier
121360	and exactly two zip ties to go with them
124840	in the box so if you break one or you
126700	want to tighten things down a bit more
127930	than you better have your own already
129269	then from there Mouse assembly is
132010	equally straightforward there's a large
134500	compartment for cable management though
136540	with no zip tie anchors for some reason
138549	and a little gap to bring it up to the
140650	top with minimal cable drag finally
143410	there's this handy little compartment
145090	that's presumably for condoms due to all
147100	the sex that you'll be having whenever
148540	anyone sees you using one of these which
151209	I guess leads us pretty well into the
152799	usage experience the aluminum top plate
155260	makes the lap dog very very solid but
158620	also kind of heavy and unwieldly
161320	and not helping matters is the way that
163840	the mouse flops about and slides cringe
167300	lay off the mousepad whenever you take
168950	your hand off of it or move the board
171490	but once it's in position
173930	it is mostly pretty darn functional the
177470	only limit to the kinds of games that
179840	you'll be able to play from the couch
181190	now we'll be the ones imposed by the
183320	game developer due to poor text scaling
186680	implementations of the UI and the like
189110	and having extra USB ports for a headset
191870	or a thumb drive is pretty nice but
194690	there are also some oversights that I'd
197450	like to see addressed in AV 2 1 it needs
201200	wrist rests within 20 minutes holding up
204860	my arms or resting on the hard metal
208100	edges of lap dog we're both kind of a
210290	drag to the integrated mouse pad is not
213140	double-sided for some reason nor is it
215270	symmetrical so that I can DIY an
217370	alternate pad for the other side and
219760	three there needs to be a narrower K 65
224540	only version I realized the widen board
227960	improves keyboard compatibility but it
230690	causes interference with plush arm rests
233300	a wider than natural gaming posture and
236320	discomfort when typing and all for what
239030	so I can have a number pad for all the
241430	accounting that I'll be doing on my TV
251269	I'm not personally a huge fan of ten
254190	kilos keyboards but it would save 30
257040	bucks on a $300 purchase and it was the
261660	right move here
262620	ergonomically and Corsair chickened out
264690	a little bit I am
266160	oh let's move on to the razor turret
268979	where the lap dog screams no compromises
272580	the turret counters with I'm not perfect
275729	but I'm small and attractive enough that
277680	your wife might actually allow this
279360	thing in her house which is not a bad
281340	point included in the Box is a wall wart
284070	a weighted base station that charges
286080	both the keyboard and mouse when they're
287910	not in use a wireless receiver and a
290880	wireless keyboard and mouse both of
293460	which are capable of being used with
294870	Bluetooth or with their 2.4 gigahertz
297300	receiver with the flick of a switch and
299430	both of which were specifically designed
301410	to be bundled together as this product
304470	purpose-built for couch gaming it's just
307650	too bad that they the mouse in
310320	particular really didn't impress me
313850	surprisingly and maybe the higher input
316440	leg of TV's especially my LG OLED
319590	compared to monitors was a factor here I
321630	didn't feel like the wireless interface
323970	hurt the gaming experience but there
326580	were other things that did the mouse
328860	clicks are pleasantly tactile and the
330960	scroll wheels satisfying scroll and
333150	rubber coating feel great but even with
335940	my tiny girl hands this thing feels like
339210	a toy apart from there being nowhere to
342030	rest my pinky the sides are the worst
344820	kind of slippery glossy plastic making
347400	it hard to lift and reposition the mouse
350130	on the 20 by 12 centimeter mouse pad and
353190	on top of that the ergonomics are bad
356280	enough that within about half an hour my
358590	wrist was getting that cold sensation
360919	radiating from my joints really bad kind
364770	of sore inspite of one huge advantage
368430	that's given to the turret by its
370200	low-profile design the fact that your
372419	thigh can be used as a wrist rest the
375630	keyboard fared quite a bit better it's
377849	got a similar layout and feel to my
380219	blade 14 daily driver laptop the
382650	function keys are shorter and the space
384310	bar is noticeably mushy er but it's very
387100	usable at least when it's centered in
389050	front of me
390180	unfortunately the hinge that unfolds the
393040	attached mousepad doesn't lock into
395169	place so unless you want that to sag
397510	causing your mouse to fall you'll be
399460	stuck with it off to the left where it
401290	is much less comfortable to use
402880	although significantly more comfortable
404710	than the keyboard on the couch master
406300	now to be clear there are some very good
409810	ideas in the turret the dual wireless
412210	interfaces would make the turret a
414010	reasonably competent set of travel
416050	peripherals if they could be charged via
418300	USB with Android compatibility as an
420910	awesome bonus the mouse is magnetic and
424419	with a hard textured bottom foot that
426820	glides well enough on the smooth pad
429190	without falling off all the time
431320	a much more elegant solution to the
433270	mouse whacking things every time I try
435220	and move the damn thing syndrome that
437020	other couch gaming boards suffer from
439530	like that and the compact folding form
443500	factor could probably work for me with a
446500	little bit more y-axis height on the
449380	mousepad it just feels kind of first-gen
453430	still and at a hundred and sixty dollars
455740	it's not an impulse buy for most people
458470	which I guess leads us pretty well into
460960	the overall conclusion here the barriers
463600	that exist for keyboard and mouse couch
465880	gaming are deeper than the lack of
468370	available platforms on which to place
470710	peripherals with game UI scaling being a
473560	significant one and the fact that a
475390	keyboard and mouse being more
477400	comfortable to use while sitting up
479380	straight or even leaning slightly
480520	forward with game controllers being more
483280	comfortable to use resting in your
484660	crotch while slouched on the couch being
487150	another one the industry is making
490450	progress towards an uncompromising PC
493270	gaming experience in the living room and
495580	I think we'll get there eventually the
498669	steam controller is a viable in-between
501039	for some genres of games point-and-click
503590	like papers please comes to mind and
505710	both of these keyboard mouse solutions
508539	are better looking easier to store more
511630	refined more affordable and more
514330	functional than my three year old couch
516280	master this
517539	is real progress I just think that the
520479	balance maybe somewhere in between them
