6470	welcome to unboxing and first look at
8700	Logitech's que 750 Logitech wireless
11820	solar keyboard works in daylight lamp
15480	light and no light so not only is it
19020	solar-powered but like you know I had
21060	those calculators in elementary school
22920	and you're like you know oh yeah maybe
26070	if I just get sneak the angle just right
27869	towards the window then like it'll work
29670	and stuff and that was a real hassle
33270	well nowadays solar technology they have
37530	figured out can augment battery
41070	technology amazing right so the keyboard
44760	comes with a rechargeable battery that
47460	lasts for up to I think it's some
49379	ridiculous period of time like
51239	doo-doo-doo up to three months in total
55289	darkness and then just sits and charges
57780	while it does have access to lay it uses
60120	their unifying reciever which means you
62010	only have to have one dongle plug into
63840	your computer you can have up to six
65390	Logitech devices that support it plugged
68280	in at the same time there it is cleaning
72060	cloth included BAM unifying reciever is
75530	down here and oh that's kind of neat so
79619	it comes with just an extender this is
81720	not the unifying reciever this tiny
83130	micro USB right here is the receiver but
85590	you can do that if you want to get a
86670	little bit further away from some
87990	interference out of the back of the case
89579	or or you know if you want to be able to
92700	remove it from your motherboard more
93930	easily then you can turn on me okay
97890	what else do they have to say for
99329	themselves about this guy elegant thin
101070	profile yeah definitely eco-friendly
103259	pvc-free construction framed keys for
106290	your modern set up whatever that means I
108570	think they mean chiclet keys something
110250	they're trying to say I think that's
111180	what they're trying to say 2.4 gigahertz
112979	feels good very thin powered by light
115710	plug it forget it add to it the unifying
118860	reciever right so you just throw that in
120509	there then you can sync as many Logitech
123030	devices you want
123950	is actually really nice so see you okay
125899	you guys you can see there's a little
127039	bit of flex to it not much though all
129769	things considered check out how thin
131720	this is it's very heavy now that comes
134540	with the territory with the battery
136010	that's included as well as the solar
138170	cells that are included it comes with
139670	protection plastic covering so let's go
141739	ahead and get that off it also has an
145220	on/off switch although given that it
146480	runs for months on battery life and runs
149780	on light and if you're not like the
153379	biggest basement dweller ever the light
157220	probably exists in your universe this is
160730	probably gonna get and connect the
162170	battery this is indicating the on/off
164299	switch
164630	oh no way okay so let's turn it on check
169040	that out
169970	that means it's charging that means it's
172700	not saying I can check is it charging is
176180	it not oh you know what we should do we
178220	should like we should cover the solar
179900	cells and then we should try and get it
182810	to always to try and get it to not be
184489	charging and then we'll see if that's
186260	actually what it is because I'm guessing
187730	right now yeah see BAM
190989	so now you can tell is it running on
193310	battery is it not running on battery ah
195700	so cool okay the back of it's fairly
198650	straightforward you got your little feet
200630	here so you can actually do that which
205910	sort of self-explanatory and let's see
209540	how it feels
210310	hello how are you today this is actually
213799	not bad for them bring eboard and yeah
219880	I'm impressed
221630	in terms of layout long shift keys long
224329	answer long and backspace so no
225950	complaints their function keys are
228019	handled so one windows key one function
229910	key wouldn't minded seeing those reverse
231500	especially if you're going to use it for
232790	games although it's not exactly a gaming
234410	keyboard but your function keys give you
236209	access to home mail search calculator
238340	love that I love in fact I prefer a
240620	dedicated button for calculator because
242329	calculator is important to me music
244819	which I think what they mean to say is
246440	play and pause oh no there it is
248480	playable okay oh I guess that just
250069	launches your music application forward
252049	back play pause volume controls as well
254390	as powering the PC on and
256480	off all these are correct sometimes you
259000	see like a long delete and like inserts
260980	gone and lever like somewhere else as a
262900	function key or some ghetto thing like
264340	that but no everything looks good layout
266440	wise the chiclet keys have a bit of a
268420	roundedness to them i want to get you
269710	guys kind of a better angle can you see
271150	that can you see they're not flat so
274000	what that means is it can can can you
275680	okay so what that means is that you can
278050	actually quite easily find the center of
280420	the key while you're typing it's
281650	difficult to it's difficult to
283420	demonstrate but I'm you guys will just
285400	have to kind of take my word for it it
286840	feels it actually feels pretty good and
288790	you can hear there's there's some
292780	tactile response to the keyboard because
294310	it's so thin there's no flex to it
296110	whatsoever which is the actually the
299200	secret to a chiclet keyboard because
301030	that's where you run into trouble with
302410	these chiclet keyboards on laptops when
304420	they're using just an inadequate shell
306790	and there's a lot of flex to the
308200	keyboard they're very uncomfortable to
309640	type on but as long as they're nice and
311200	rigid like for example on the mac books
312970	where they have the aluminum base for it
314470	then it feels really really good so it's
316720	kind of an either horrible or great sort
319300	of experience rubber feet on the bottom
321100	keep it from slipping around so if I
323410	were to do this it would stop and I
326500	think that pretty much covers it thank
327790	you for checking out my unboxing and
329170	first look at the K 750 which is
331630	actually just kind of the smartest thing
333760	ever because it's just Wireless and
335590	battery lists and should be pretty much
338560	the last keyboard you ever need which is
340720	bad for NCIX I guess because we still
342940	want to slow your keyboards but good for
345700	you so already don't forget to subscribe
