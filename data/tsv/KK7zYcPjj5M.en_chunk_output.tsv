60	today I'm gonna be having a look at a
1979	very special edition of the Razer Naga
4770	this is the Razer Naga Moulton special
8730	edition so this is an expert MMO gaming
11070	mouse for gamers by gamers which is
13019	Razer slogan it comes in a very similar
15630	packaging to the regular Naga MMO
18810	optimized multi-button thumb grid the
21119	multi button thumb gritted of the Razer
22560	Naga Moulton special edition creates an
24750	entirely new way of playing MMO games
26609	which I actually don't use from memos
29070	because I don't play a memos but I have
30689	used it for some offline RPGs like
33180	Dragon Age as well as torchlight and
35070	it's awesome so I don't have a molten
37559	Edition I have a regular naka but I just
40320	just love the way that the the grid is
43829	so easily accessible from with your
46170	thumb in addition by using razor driver
48480	software you can send any key or custom
50129	macro to all 17 buttons out standing ok
56010	what else do we got here 17 MMO
58739	optimized buttons maximum comfort for
61829	long gaming sessions and it's true
63510	custom interface add-ons for MMO games
66270	as well as an ergonomic design 3.5
68369	Julie's air sensor it has a great sensor
71840	1000 Hertz
73140	ultra poling on-the-fly sensitivity as
75000	well as ultra slick Mouse feet on the
77250	back we find more of the same
79229	7-foot lightweight braided fiber cable
81479	gold plated USB connector anti-slip
84869	rubber coating on the top as well as a
86430	scroll wheel with 24 individual click
89100	positions is that so
90600	I have never bothered count how many
94619	click positions there are on a MOS wheel
97200	before and I don't think we're gonna be
101759	able to count this one because you don't
103500	really have any way of knowing where it
104640	starts unless you mark it somehow
107100	alright so let's find out what's in the
108540	box first things first we have razor as
112560	usual excellent packaging which includes
129519	for gamers by gamers Razer zone calm
132650	okay
133310	what do we got in here probably user
135500	guide probably some kind of driver desk
137989	probably a catalogue of other Razer
140360	merchandise probably a certificate of
142610	authenticity there it is blue the grid
145549	trainer so this includes little dots
147849	which you can apply however you desire
150379	to allow you to more easily find your
153290	way around the grid so you've got some
155810	square ones you got some circle ones
157579	whatever you prefer cool Quick Start
161810	Guide master guides some stickers
165010	something about get em BA okay as well
173810	as I bought a catalog so no driver disc
175610	guess you're gonna download the latest
176690	drivers from the Razer website which I
179420	would have expected my more dedicated
182150	viewers to already know to do anyhow so
185360	here why don't we put these back in this
186920	correct order here throw that in there
190609	somewhere
191269	throw that in there somewhere no yes it
199220	will
199549	no it won't I don't know how this is
200810	gonna work okay so put that there and
203090	then let's get the Razer Naga Moulton
205910	edition out of the packaging so here is
210410	the braided cable with gold plated USB
213079	connector next to my keys which no
215239	longer need to be here as well as the
217790	plastic packaging that comes off here
221239	and boom we have unboxed the mouse it
224000	was actually that easy
225109	so the molten Edition here just for the
227150	sake of comparison next to the regular
230569	non molten Edition you know what I think
233780	they've actually slightly altered the
236120	finish on it although it's hard to say
237590	cuz mine's quite worn yeah no maybe not
240380	no I change my mind I don't think
242150	they've changed the finish on it versus
244430	the original Naga okay you can see from
247489	the side that they are quite identical
251049	okay you can see from the other side
253540	they are also quite identical from that
256430	angle as well so it looks like all we've
257719	really changed
258820	is this piece of plastic the pattern on
260890	it from a Razer logo to a cracked
265930	well Razer logo but a more different one
268630	okay so we're gonna go ahead and plug
274540	this in in order to experience what it
278680	looks like side by side with the
281320	original Naga Oh pulsating oh well oh
286810	did they both start pulsating oh no no
288550	that was just the driver - oh well on oh
290790	wow they both started pulsating bizzare
294070	I've never seen my blue one do that
295540	before okay
297480	must be something to do with the driver
299380	so here's the 3.5 G sensor on the bottom
301960	here here's where you can switch between
303580	the number pad or the number buttons at
306550	the top of the keyboard depending what
308350	you want everything bound to the Naga
310450	has exceptional slippy pads going all
312820	the way around almost the bottom of the
316240	mouse the entire circumference and then
319120	here are all of your thumb buttons so in
321160	terms of ergonomics I'm a big fan of the
323080	Naga you know it's probably not great
324730	for people with big hands I have quite
326320	small hands and you can see that I fit
328360	very very comfortably on the Naga being
330490	able to reach the back buttons with the
332110	bottom of my thumb like this the middle
334060	buttons with the top of my thumb as well
335980	as the other two rows it just fits like
340060	an absolute glove for me it's actually
341380	one of my favourite Razer mice in terms
343870	of economics ergonomics in spite of the
347170	fact that it's kind of a weird Mouse and
348850	that it has 17 buttons on it so here's
351550	your back and forward there's your
352810	typical normal buttons that you'd find
355210	on the side of a mouse then you've got
356830	your left and right click your middle
358150	click as well as the 12 buttons on the
359920	side so thank you for checking out my
