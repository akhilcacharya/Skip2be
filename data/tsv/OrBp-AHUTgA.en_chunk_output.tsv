6710	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
10230	the me onyx sarkis 320 light you're the
13530	head of the game me onyx dotnet
14849	high-performance microfiber mousepad
16890	this is similar to their aluminum one in
19380	form factor but it is made of cloth hey
23310	a star has been born something-something
25080	model overview special microfiber
26670	surface contracts needle loss to improve
27990	the sense of tracking Pharmacy under
29220	grip is made of natural rubber offering
30960	a firm grip irrespective of the surface
32430	under the mousepad or extensive
33480	movements designed with our surface
35250	quality analyzer tool to be an 8 out of
37380	10 it has excellent tracking with
38850	minimal data loss is suitable for
40530	optical and laser mice has a thickness
42750	of two millimeters which means you're
44190	not going to be constantly rubbing your
45930	wrist on the edge of it which is
47100	actually a problem I have with my
48210	current loss pad and the surface is
50820	uncoated semi-rigid the durable flexible
52949	microfiber greater controlled air
55620	friction dampers the control over the
56820	movements okay
57690	so unlike the aluminum one here which is
60120	more of a smooth experience also two
61920	millimeters thick this guy and Oh has a
64860	surface quality if you've used the
66390	surface quality analyzer tool it's
67830	actually kind of neat and it does work
69330	like I tried sort of messing with it by
71640	putting the mouse on stuff that was just
73409	total crap and I do it and it was
75090	spitting out you know values like one
76619	even though the mouse would work on it
78330	like it's just it knows it's not
80189	accurate enough so this is a 10 this is
82470	an 8 if you like a little bit more
84270	resistance to your movement this will
86189	well resist you a little bit more and
88259	this one is very very smooth however
90090	this is obviously more expensive than a
91770	microfiber mousepad I don't know if I
93990	actually sold on this being exactly two
96409	yeah two millimeters okay they're
98610	rounding a little bit because the
99720	aluminum one is thinner than the
101250	microfiber one there's your natural
102960	rubber bottom which means it's not going
104670	anywhere and in terms of the overall
106590	grip Enis actually that's not that it's
109979	a little bit smoother than than I'd like
112170	I'm using a completely worn out qck at
114869	home and actually like it better worn
116369	out than I did new so I suspect once I
118979	broke in one like this I would have no
120600	problem with it at all the the other
122969	option available to you if you guys are
124890	are interested in it is this Argus 9 I
127560	which is basically I mean they should
130350	just call it thus Argos over 9000 so if
133140	you haven't seen my unboxing on this one
134670	already it's pretty much this except
137160	thicker and like you know huger so I
142260	think that pretty much covers it we've
143460	covered me onix's lineup of minnie mouse
146700	pads including the 900 the 320 and
149730	they're aluminum mouse pad all of which
152220	are well depending on whether you want
155430	an enormous mouse pad a smaller cloth
158280	one or a smaller lumen um one I think
159930	this is the one I'm leaning towards
162230	shouldn't pretty much do it for you
164100	thank you for checking out my unboxing a
165690	first look at the Saugus 320 from me
167370	onyx don't forget to subscribe to Linus
169170	tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
170459	other computer videos and don't forget
172110	perfect option for our mouse for any of
174060	these is the newest 5000 this is the
175680	laser version they've also got the 3200
177600	I've used them quite a bit the OP the
179780	optics the ergonomics are a fair bit
182700	like something like an Akari or a car
184590	laser which are discontinued mice
186180	unfortunate at this point so if you want
188040	something that has that economic shape
189900	this is your option and highly
192690	recommended my wife actually uses a
194160	nails 3200 very satisfied with it
