30	the Logitech G 911 truly care about
4740	competing against other wireless mice
6660	and chooses to pick a fight with the big
8880	boys the wired mice it might even get a
11490	little offended if you say for a
13469	wireless mouse when describing it so how
16800	does it fare stay tuned to find out
27109	Tunnel bear is the easy to use VPN
29460	service that lets you use the web as if
31230	you're in 20 different countries learn
32969	more and try to bear for free at the
34860	link in the video description let's
37110	start with the sensor the G 900 features
39329	the picsArt pmw 3366
42570	this is a big deal even the sticklers
44940	over on the esteemed overclock net forum
47190	voted in this poll that they would
49320	mostly prefer the 33 66 even beating out
52170	the 33 10 Edsel Yago our resident
54780	counter-strike guys stated that the 33
56789	66 felt true not affected in any way by
59579	the wireless and when he took flick
61710	shots he didn't feel like he was aiming
63690	over or under that's a good thing
65729	something to worry about when making a
67439	wireless mouse is the amount of power
69390	that you can deliver to the sensor from
71760	the battery this power must be split
74159	also to things like the wireless
75930	transmitter which you don't normally
77280	have to power not enough power to the
79439	sensor poor performance not enough power
81689	to the wireless transmitter poor
83820	performance just in a different way with
86070	input lag and whatnot this as far as
88740	I've been told is because the 33 66 was
91619	designed from the ground up as a
93270	wireless sensor and has just been fully
96180	realized now that doesn't mean that it's
98909	worse for Wired in any way at all that
101549	is not what I'm saying
102810	it just means that it's great for both
104610	and not limited to one speaking of the
107369	wireless transmitter the highly
108750	optimized 2.4 gigahertz connection in
111149	tandem with some design decisions in
113310	terms of where the transmitter is
114750	located where the battery is located in
117210	relation to where the transmitter is
118860	located and the various materials used
120810	throughout the shell and other
122340	components through throughout the entire
124439	build result in a very fast and
126630	supremely stable connection if you don't
129000	believe me that's actually a good thing
130860	doubt all claims but coming soon we have
133440	a
133620	tour of their design facility where they
135690	helped me benchmark the wireless
137129	transmitter against other competing
138900	wireless mice using their advanced
141599	equipment it's pretty cool for now their
144810	results will be on screen and you'll
146670	just have to deal with that let's move
148409	on to the click the left and right mouse
150360	buttons are based on a mechanical pivot
152519	design and also feature a spring tension
155250	system that ensure that you don't have
156629	to bend any plastic in order to just
158790	press the button which you shouldn't
160379	have to do and they also ensure that the
162450	response of the button returning home is
164670	quite fast
165840	the included Omron switches are also
167879	raised off of the main PCB onto their
170430	own and put at a slight angle so the
172950	button is pressing directly onto the
174720	switch and doesn't have to go through
176069	any other processes in order to actually
177989	press the switch there are some
180030	complaints here mainly from EDS all the
182370	buttons do have a quite noticeable
184049	horizontal shift and lift slightly if
186629	you pull up from under them I didn't
188280	notice the latter of these issues but
189989	Ed's will did because of the way that he
191819	holds his mouse his fingers actually
193829	reach slightly over the buttons and he
196379	uses the ledge there in order to
198329	actually lift the mouse a fairly
200190	interesting way of holding it so take
202500	that as you will for me I clawed which
204720	is fairly standard and I can feel the
206430	horizontal shift every single time I
208319	move it left to right not great but I do
210480	like the clicks overall and they feel
212250	satisfying and responsive physically
214889	it's designed in a way that it looks
216480	sufficiently different and futuristic to
218910	represent its design mentality but also
221280	holds enough of its Logitech
223199	characteristics that you'd probably be
225239	able to identify it as a Logitech mouse
227849	even if it was completely d badged it's
230519	weight is pretty damn good at 107 grams
233099	compared to the SteelSeries rival at 128
235680	grams and the G 303 at 87 that's
238919	comparing it to wired mice for a cable
241739	it has a micro USB connection and an
243660	included six foot braided USB cable that
246480	feels quite nice for when you need it to
248489	charge the mouse and maybe even play
250139	with at the same time or to extend the
252720	receiver closer to your mouse using the
254699	small included adapter the mouse is
257099	ambidextrous with swappable magnetic
259769	forward and back buttons and symmetrical
262890	design it features a hyper fast scroll
265169	wheel but with a little bit of
266970	wait shed by using a spoked design
269760	instead of a solid design this further
271800	contributes to the lightweight overall
273630	construction of the mouse the scroll
275550	wheel also features tilt inputs and is
277770	able to be switched between click
279420	scrolling and free scrolling with the
281310	button featured right behind it behind
283380	that button are dpi up and down buttons
285720	and indicator LEDs to keep you from
287730	guessing the bottom of the most features
289500	six individual feet placements and an
291870	on/off switch and another button that is
293940	used to switch between onboard memory
295770	profiles which brings us conveniently to
298740	the Logitech Gaming software the
300540	software allows you to configure onboard
302280	memory profiles which are helpful if you
304650	use computers that are not your own
306300	profile configurations to bind various
308940	buttons to various things configure your
311580	dpi set your report rate and tell the
313980	mouse what forward and back button
315540	configuration you currently have due to
317220	the magnet setup then you have lighting
319260	control where you can set lighting modes
320880	based on profiles which features solid
323730	color color cycling and breathing modes
326520	for all the various RGB colors that you
329010	could want then you come to the battery
330870	settings which are my favorite
332490	personally it can tell you approximately
334050	how much gaming time you have left and
336570	can change that estimation based on your
338910	lighting preferences this resulted in me
341400	quickly turning off all of the lights
343350	that were on the mouse and going for
345360	maximum possible time but I'm not really
348390	the target audience for RGB anyways so
351419	oh well also a estimate that they have
354810	is 32 hours of usable Mouse currently
358290	moving time per full charge which is
361350	pretty sweet after that you have surface
363479	tuning for the various most pad types
365400	that you may be using a key press map
367650	which is probably a lot more applicable
369630	on a keyboard that a mouse but is cool
371970	nonetheless when all is said and done I
374340	can confidently say that this is the
375960	best wireless mouse that I have ever
377790	personally used and that's kind of
379860	saying a lot because I used to be a
382140	constant user of the Logitech g7 the one
385169	that had like those swappable battery
386400	packs which I still actually kind of
388470	missed because then you literally never
389850	have to have it plugged in but I
391020	understand that would add weight
392310	constraints and people want lighter mice
393990	whatever don't worry about it I ditched
396180	that mouse which was my favorite because
398400	of wanting to be a better gamer
400710	there was too much input lag and all
402330	this kind of crap so I went for a wired
404430	mouse but I have always missed the
406650	freedom what I appreciate about this
408840	mouse is that it's wireless transmitter
412110	delay is very low it's extremely fast
414900	Mouse even beating out some wired mice
417300	in terms of input which you can see in
419310	the video that's coming soon when I
420810	benchmark it using their specialized
422280	equipment the click input time is super
424830	fast the sensor is great it's it's I
428040	don't know I like it a lot
429990	mass drop is starting April strong with
432270	their best of mass drop sale if you
434130	don't know who or what mass drop is it's
436620	actually relatively simple mass drop is
438540	a group by system so essentially how
440850	that works is they set a different tiers
443580	of pricing and depending on how many
445080	people buy something or agree to buy
448020	something at a certain time that price
450090	will go down to a maximum level which is
452640	kind of Awesome it's the group by model
454560	but in a much easier package by mass
457470	drop the sale features many products
459510	including their Royal glam 60% wood
461790	keyboard keyboard case in their mech
463920	Keys section for $89.99 or essentially

497880	yeah check it out let me know what you
500640	think in the comments down below also if
503220	you liked the video like it if you
504660	dislike the video dislike it if you're
506310	like wireless mice suck anyways even
508560	though you have evidence coming in a
510510	video soon that it's pretty dope that's
512760	fine you can do that subscribe if you
515340	liked the channel you want to see more
517049	stuff don't forget to use our amazon
518429	affiliate code if you buy things like
519929	this mouse or a competing wired mouse
522510	because you still want that you want to
525240	have like cable ties
526830	bungees and whatnot anyways don't forget
529380	to become a contributor on the forum or
530760	even just a member on the forum buy a
532560	t-shirt which is more interesting than
534360	this one because I was just filming a
535950	fast as possible episode and have a good
538830	day
539250	also if you want to see another video
540600	click up here to watch ed Zola's final
542940	Mouse review because that's very
544680	applicable if you're looking for
