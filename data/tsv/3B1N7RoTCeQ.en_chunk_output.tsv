0	this is the microsoft arc it's not out
3120	yet but we do have a sample here to show
5700	you today this is a wireless style that
9630	works that's their little slogan for it
11519	wireless pc and mac keyboard and their
15210	their thing is ok yeah that it's style
17279	that works so it's a stylish small
19560	little keyboard that's meant to be I
21390	would imagine well here's what I would
22859	use it for ok I'm not going to tell you
24539	what it's for cuz I don't know what they
26130	intended for but I would use this from
27990	the coach to control my media center
29490	because it's exactly the kind of size
31320	that you can comfortably put it in your
33000	lap but still be able to comfortably
34770	tight actually we'll find out if we can
36329	comfortably type once I actually get it
38160	out of the box but ok here we go why
40530	don't we see what what Microsoft has to
42629	say about it meet the art keyboard with
44879	beautiful curves and a compact design
46829	it's at home wherever you are ok so in
50100	my case on the couch excellent you can
52289	show it off clean lines and an
53789	eye-catching shape compliment your style
55710	here there anywhere something about
58469	using it anywhere and be free also
61440	something about using it anywhere they
63030	have a little picture of the Nano
64760	transceiver for wireless freedom ok so
67680	let's find the seals and I do not have
72869	anything even remotely resembling a
76470	knife on me ah ok here hold on actually
81150	just a sec I have a fork and I will just
84630	use that to pierce the sticker and then
87960	hopefully the whole sticker will come
90060	away from for me and then we'll go from
92189	there or i could just peel the sticker
94049	bear with me here just going to peel the
96420	sticker up because my fork has lasagna
98880	on it and i think that that would be not
102420	quite sanitary especially because like
106189	well you know old lasagna isn't really a
109710	very sanitary thing to put on stuff
111659	that's my wisdom for the day
115100	okay so here we are it is covered in a
120030	little cloth chief that is to protect it
122760	from scratches I'm assuming and also to
124409	make the presentation of this is
126360	actually excellent look at this so you
128130	open up your box you get a little sheath
130949	pocket envelope thing here made of like
133319	a nice glossy material then you get oh
135360	this is nice so this is would be a CD
137400	and probably your users guide start here
141620	helpfully labeled even so you right here
145080	so this must be a quick start guide so
147150	they show you how to put in the
148260	batteries put in the wireless
149670	transceiver and then press the buttons
152910	in order to link it up oh cool oh that's
155670	a neat system so basically to turn the
157680	keyboard okay to turn the keyboard on or
159480	off press and hold function and escape
161100	until the battery light changes and then
163910	that's it huh neato okay then you've got
170760	a Microsoft product guide here which
173340	probably did some warranty information
174750	as well okay to triple-a batteries not a
178110	big fan of triple-a batteries but when
180120	you're trying to make a device as
181260	compact as possible sometimes it's
183720	unavoidable that's just it they're sort
186239	of them more as expensive as double A's
188790	and you don't get more battery life out
190320	of them etcetera etc they're not really
192150	my favorite thing but let's get this arc
196019	keyboard out of here who that is nice
197970	actually so you can see it has a slight
200100	curve to it hence the name arc and on
202470	the bottom is a cleverly designed little
204690	compartment for the double or triple A
206400	batteries to know I'm all screwed up for
208440	the triple A batteries and then right
210600	here is the little nano transceiver is
213150	that I love it selden by a magnet look
216329	at that so you never have to worry about
220010	yeah it coming up as long as you know
223410	you don't have a and curious toddler
226230	that comes along and eats it anyway
228989	that's really convenient and then the
230730	top of the keyboard itself so I'm gonna
232260	apologize in advance for the crotch shot
234630	here I'm just gonna go ahead and put
236100	this on my lap and actually that's not
238829	bad you can comfortably reach all the
241260	buttons it is a very standard layout so
244739	you can see that you've got long shift
246030	keys on both sides you've got a
247670	in Turkey so it doesn't have any of the
249800	weird bilingual keys that cut off your
251450	shift or the the strangely located / key
255200	that would cut your backspace down to
257029	the point where I mean if you have small
258738	hands reaching a backspace beyond about
261108	here is completely unreasonable so yeah
264320	I I personally hate the short backspace
266330	key you've got all of your function keys
268900	no you do not oh this is interesting
271190	okay in order to save space what they've
273650	done with the layout is a they've only
275240	got one Windows key so there's no
276800	windows key on the right-hand side
278360	that's a function key oh and this
279680	appears to be a mouse that is something
281960	I didn't know that oh no these are your
283490	arrows okay so here are all the things
285350	that they've managed to make more
286729	compact they've removed the Windows key
288350	put in a function key they've turned the
290570	control the right control into the arrow
293150	keys which is a one d-pad button okay
296660	then up here they've actually got f1 to
300110	f6 and then you use the function key in
303320	order to access f7 to f12 great that
306680	works for me and then we've got all of
308810	our home end page up page down and print
311270	screen all in four buttons right here
313100	and then they've even included media
315140	buttons so you've got mute louder and
316850	quieter and then delete an insert but no
320300	no play stop pause that's a little bit
322789	disappointing given what I personally
325039	would be using something like this for
326660	but I mean really if you have a media
328190	center you should probably on one of
329419	these already anyway it's like the most
331520	useful fifteen dollars or whatever it
334490	costs that I've ever spent on a hardware
336200	component in fact I own three anyway
338210	thank you for checking on my unboxing
339650	and first look at the ark I still think
342050	the coolest feature is the magnetic
343580	transceiver that's so cool thank you
346550	again for checking out my unboxing of
348470	the Microsoft dark
