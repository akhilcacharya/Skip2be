0	a few months ago I checked out the lap
2159	dog and turret Corsairs and razors
5190	respectively solutions to the supremely
8150	first world problem of not being able to
11130	have an optimal keyboard mouse gaming
13290	experience on the big-screen TV from the
15450	couch tragic I know anyway
18869	the conclusion of that video was that my
21210	ideal solution probably lies somewhere
23460	in between the usability and ergonomic
27119	compromises of the small sexy but
30720	cramped turret and the lap dog whose
35190	size makes it more like having a Great
36989	Dane stretched across my thighs than any
39600	miniature canine that I've ever
41250	encountered and I guess rocket was
44190	watching that video going but tech
46140	lioness that's basically our product
48379	because they reached out almost
50160	immediately after that one went live
52230	asking me to take a look at the Sylva Mk
55410	so let's see then if it solves the
57690	problems that I've had with other lap
60030	board solutions
70180	cooller masters master case maker five
72920	features they're freeform modular system
75649	allowing you to customize adjust and
77720	upgrade make it yours at the link in the
80539	video description we'll begin with the
83210	physical tour the bottom of the Silva
85369	has for removable cushions they're
87530	pretty thin but they work well enough so
89810	I don't think I would try to 3d print
91670	replacements for them but being able to
93710	clean them is still a bonus also down
96289	here is a single proprietary breakaway
98689	USB connection with a four meter lead
101060	and a couple of USB ports for other
103159	peripherals mouse and a headset come to
105890	mind flipping the unit over about 40% of
109429	the top is taken up by a 275 by 240
112520	millimeter hard plastic composite
114170	mousepad another 40% is taken up by the
117110	84 key TTC Brown mechanical keyboard and
121009	the last 20% or so is taken up by what
125599	might look to razor in Corsair like
128239	wasted space but what ended up being the
131500	difference maker for me an ample wrist
134870	rest that let me use the silva MK
137239	comfortably for up to three hours at a
140000	time
140390	compare that to 10 to 30 minutes on the
143299	other two and okay yes I know you're not
147829	supposed to rest your wrists while you
150590	type on a keyboard but do you honestly
152530	type like this I mean okay let's say you
155930	do do you game like that
157760	get real while on the surface the Silva
161180	is quite similar to other lap boards and
163609	to Corsairs offering in particular for
166190	an ergonomic product the devil is in the
169069	details and the wrist rest is just the
171680	tip of the iceberg for me the next big
174170	one is the inclusion of a 10 keyless
176810	rather than a full width keyboard I mean
180620	sure you don't have a number pad for tax
183470	accountant simulator or whatever but it
185840	definitely solves more problems than it
188239	creates one unless you're the Incredible
191480	Hulk
191870	it brings your hands closer together for
194510	a more natural posture - it makes typing
197840	much more comfortable and more accurate
200870	since the homerun
201860	is somewhat directly in front of you
204140	three it not only fits on my couch so I
207530	don't have to sit on the crack between
208970	the cushions but it allows a lady friend
211310	to sit on the couch with me while I game
213350	without looking like she has some kind
215150	of a restraining order and for when your
218060	lady friend wants to use the couch for
219590	something other than gaming it's smaller
221900	dimensions make it easier to stow away
223790	and there are more little details Roque
226970	adopted for two plugs on the PC side
229400	rather than a wall powered hub this does
232370	lower the combined power draw limit for
234830	all the connected devices versus the lap
236810	dog but along with that breakaway cable
239990	it makes setup and teardown faster and
242150	easier improving wife appeal the wrist
245150	rest and mousepad are theoretically
247130	replaceable which is cool but I haven't
248990	seen anything actually available yet and
250730	the rail system along the top promises
253610	3d printable accessories like cell phone
255920	holders and the included wire management
257988	system is really clever
259670	it holds the cable as well as Corsair
262250	system but does it without tools so you
264920	won't be tearing your hair out looking
266510	for an Allen wrench if a buddy needs to
268700	borrow your extra mouse the keyboard
271310	also continuing with things that are
273050	good feel surprisingly good and key to
275870	key consistency was surprisingly strong
278810	considering that they're using a Cherry
280730	MX brown clone from a company that I
282830	actually hadn't even heard of before ttc
285560	I'm not personally sold on the tactile
287780	bump on the W key but it's a minor issue
290330	considering that the layout is otherwise
292700	very good considering how little space
294980	they had to work with the arrows are
297260	correctly spaced and easy to land mark -
299960	thanks to their edge position the media
302210	keys are a must for couch use and I
304580	think that every keyboard should require
306650	a modifier to turn on the caps lock
308770	thumbs up there so then if it wasn't
312410	clear already I like this product and I
314960	think it's the best in the category so
317030	far but that doesn't make it perfect
319100	Mouse drift when you take your hand off
321800	of it is still a pretty annoying issue
324169	though I don't know how they would
326150	resolve this without creating a special
328250	Mouse with some grip on the bottom like
330200	Razer did but personally if given the
332900	choice I would prefer to be able to use
335330	my
335660	mouse with it so I don't have a solution
337400	and there's nothing that rocket can do
339650	to fix the bigger issues with couch
341630	gaming like poor UI scaling and games
344540	that weren't designed to be played from
346610	10 plus feet away but if you're willing
350000	to deal with those things and you're
351740	willing to pay for it
353030	I think the Silva should be 20 to 30
355250	dollars cheaper than a lap dog and 10
357560	kilos keyboard not more expensive thanks
360050	to lower switch costs and cheaper
361700	materials once they offset the
363410	development cost of a custom keyboard
364640	for it the Silva is the best couch
367910	gaming experience yet ting is the mobile
372320	carrier that is focused on customer
373670	service and customer satisfaction first
376160	you never have to speak to a robot you
378200	get put through directly to a person
379940	which is worth its weight in gold but
382190	you pay only for what you use so none of
384170	that gold bit
385130	the average ting bill is only $23 per
387800	month per device if you're stuck in a
390470	contract and switched to ting they will
392720	cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to
395510	$75 they are now lowering mobile data
398420	rates across the board data is now just
