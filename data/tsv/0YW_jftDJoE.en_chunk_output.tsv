0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to
2159	you by the symbiote demo car from group
3899	Renault we'll have that linked in the
5700	video description so we're here in the
9090	asus rog suite where they've got a ton
11849	of amazing display technology on display
15690	first up is their 144 hertz 4k HDR
19470	gaming monitor that we actually saw
22320	demoed like a year ago the PG 2 7uq but
27539	the key difference is that they are
29130	actually going to be shipping this thing
30660	really soon so that's a large 27-inch
33660	g-sync display 144 hertz 4k pretty much
37739	can't go wrong unless of course you're
39600	into ultra wide gaming in which case
41219	might be more into the PG 35 VQ so
45149	that's a 34 40 by 1440 35 inch g-sync
50239	200 Hertz display so that is double the
53820	refresh rate of the predator x34 one of
56850	my personal favorite gaming displays
60050	also here is a Seuss's flavor oven
62969	videos BFG TV display what are they
67530	calling it yeah yeah BFG D or big format
72210	gaming display I don't think they have a
74130	model name for it yet but in a nutshell
76020	it's a 65 inch monitor effectively
80280	because it doesn't have a TV tuner but
82500	it does have a lot of features that are
83939	appealing to gamers so it uses a VA
85799	panel with a three thousand to 1
87299	contrast ratio it runs out a hundred and
89610	twenty Hertz 4k resolution with HDR and
93000	it has a built-in Nvidia shield so you
96150	can play Android games you can stream
98130	Netflix Amazon Prime
99720	etc but most importantly they're
102270	boasting ultra-low latency so if you're
104759	a couch gamer that looks like it's going
107070	to be the solution sometime later this
109799	year the most visually interesting one
113130	though is probably this guy now on the
115890	surface this looks pretty boring it's
119490	just like a couple of rubber pieces at
122159	the top and bottom and then it's a strip
124770	of PMMA which is a plastic material
126950	similar to acrylic but what's special
130199	about it
131510	is the Fresnel style lenses that are cut
135290	into it so traditionally the way to
137989	achieve bending of light would be to
140480	have like a big bubble lens but instead
142430	this just has a bunch of slits cut into
145069	it all along kind of similar to the
147319	rings that you see inside of an HTC vive
149959	and what it does is if you put it on top
153049	of the bezels of Zeus's PG 2 v 8 q
156769	gaming monitor it makes them essentially
159799	disappear by stretching the edge of this
162349	screen and the edge of this one creating
165319	a bezel effect now it's not perfect you
168709	do lose a little bit of light so they
170959	are a little bit dimmer but I will say
173150	that if you're into sim racing the
175129	experience is significantly more
177200	immersive they're optimized for a
179269	hundred and thirty degree angles and
180889	they're working on getting it working
182389	with the PG 35 V Q and pricing is
185239	expected to be able they don't know but
186920	they're saying under $100 which like I
190370	would hope so but like that seems pretty
193670	reasonable if you're into surround
194930	gaming so there you go I took apart
198199	their demo anyway this video was brought
202400	to you guys by the symbiote demo car
204079	from group Renault we checked it out
205819	quite recently it's their level 4
208250	autonomous car that I actually got to
210410	drive and I use the term drive with a
213500	serious asterisk on it because we
216019	managed to take it out on the freeway
218620	with my hands completely off the wheel
221299	the seat tilted back and then at its
223459	most extreme with a VR headset on that
227449	was actually simulating what it would be
230269	like if I was in a completely different
232250	environment whatsoever with the car
234379	sensors themselves tied into the VR
238099	headset so you guys are gonna want to
240349	check out that video to see the latest
242239	in autonomous driving innovations we're
244250	gonna have it linked in the video
245629	description so thanks for watching guys
