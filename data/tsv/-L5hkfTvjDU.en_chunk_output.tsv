7660	this is the XFX a war pad with edgeless
12320	support system and I'm going to go as
15320	far as to say that this is the most
17300	obvious thing that nobody ever came up
19820	with before blaze a warpath with the XFX
24200	war Pad giving everyone you know what
26989	I'm just gonna I'm gonna read this up
27919	see guys giving every bit of the
29810	advantage the XFX warp pad provides the
32870	perfect gaming surface that isn't rough
34880	around the edges designed to eliminate
37040	friction and discomfort while amassing
39140	those hours of gaming the XFX warp pad
41870	provides an edge 'less support system
44480	that provides comfort for your continual
47030	gameplay come on no okay game on without
51410	rubbing your forearm on the rough corner
54230	of your desk and glide to victory so
57110	that last sentence is probably the only
59600	part of that that has any relevance
60860	whatsoever but very relevant it happens
65750	to be so the warp pad is basically a
68420	plastic clamp right here with a soft
72710	nice thick very comfortable feeling
75259	cloth gaming mouse pad wrapped around it
78740	so what you do is you take your clamp
83319	put it on the end you know I'm going to
85340	do it on this side so you can actually
86509	see what I'm doing and there's some more
88999	of the pucks we're gonna be unboxing
91039	okay so warp pad cleanup someone like
94729	that whoops
96319	sorry shouldn't hit that so hard and so
98090	now instead okay so here here here I'm
101420	gonna pretend this is my other mouse pad
103280	which sits at the edge of my desk like
105259	this right so instead of having my arm
107479	on the edge of the desk when I'm moving
109759	it around now my arm is on a curved
112700	surface and I am more comfortable that's
117469	it that's the whole thing it's like a
118939	fairly simple concept but climb songs
122450	are pretty much any desk so you can see
124039	the minimum thickness is kind of about
125659	like that I would say where it's gonna
127369	grip on with any force you got rubber
129348	grippy things on this side and then
131450	you've also this parts plastic but it's
133550	pretty it's a pretty grippy plastic so
135500	you shouldn't have too much trouble in
137000	terms of it staying attached you can see
139070	there's a little nook
140150	so that you don't jam it on too far it's
142489	only meant for the edge of the table to
144230	be right about here in terms of the size
146329	of the work pad here I'll just hold it
147860	up to myself so you can see
149060	approximately how big it is
150349	I'd say it's got plenty of length and it
153110	should be wide enough for 90 95 percent
156799	of gamers not too many people use got
158629	very very low sensitivity style okay it
162530	has a warranty of one year and I think
167420	that's pretty much it that was it that
169819	was the unboxing that was the product
171829	showcase and that was even the SAP guide
173870	so thank you for checking out this first
