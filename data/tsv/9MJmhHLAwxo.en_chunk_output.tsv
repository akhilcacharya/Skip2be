60	yes a Tron Gaming Mouse this is from
3600	Razer so this isn't gonna be some cheesy
6000	thing that you know just throwing the
8099	Tron branding at something in order to
9900	sell a few Razer makes quality gaming
12420	stuff so we can expect this to be a
15049	really cool and be like really cool in
18960	terms of functionality as well so this
21720	is designed by Razer good stop for
23850	gamers by gamers it has like a Tron
26699	style style to it let's have a look at
29609	what it has to say for itself unique
31590	Tron light and sound features really
34399	sound effects straight from the movie
37079	let the mouse react to your actions on
39180	the game grid with authentic light
41010	alerts okay cool cool 5600 DPI Razer
46079	precision 3.5 deleseur sensor so that
48840	uses a quality Razer sensor it has an
51629	ambidextrous design something razors
53730	really been all about for a lot of years
56520	they've released a lot of ambidextrous
58379	mice alright we've got light trail
60570	precision precision fluo trace oh okay
65309	that's French awesome okay so the actual
68030	technical specifications light and sound
70590	effects that startup and shutdown
72049	lighting alerts ambidextrous signs seven
75060	hyper response buttons so we'll have a
76830	look at those in a minute
77930	1000 Hertz ultra poling so that's one
80340	millisecond response and abraded
81869	seven-foot USB cable see what it has to
84600	say for itself on the back same thing
87290	was I guess there's only so much you can
89310	say about a mouse so why don't we get it
90750	open and have a look at it and I'll give
93030	you guys sort of what my impressions of
95430	this particular gaming product I mean if
101130	there actually is there a Tron game that
103590	this is launching along with or is it
105000	just mostly to do with the Tron Legacy
106470	movie I actually don't know I'm not even
109890	sure who I'm asking because cameraman
111509	won't talk so alright Razer is so good
114630	at packaging love the way they do their
116340	packaging they've got kind of a glossy
118409	dots and hexagons thing going on here
121409	with a matte black finish any package
123960	with matte black on it is always awesome
125969	pretty much oh yeah you got like the
128250	Tron thing going on on the side
129929	the box as well so you pull that off
131810	come on these guys are like packaging
134760	masters look at this I can't figure out
137609	how to get it out but oh there we go
139379	look at that so that's pretty cool it's
141930	like a plastic cover of like a smoked
145469	it's a smoked plexi cover thing that
148139	goes on top of it's got your Disney Tron
150540	Legacy oh you can't die just die - no
153420	camera net can you tell he shrugs ok
156840	well hopefully I didn't Tron Legacy
158810	hopefully you can actually see that now
160709	there you go that's what it looks like
161760	all right welcome to the cult of razor
165209	I do feel welcomed by that little saying
168359	there okay let's pull this up - we have
170400	in terms of accessories so I'm
171659	accustomed to seeing these this is
173579	probably going to contain a guide to
176939	razors other products as well as an
178620	instruction manual and a couple of
180750	stickers just a wild swing in the dark
189650	there's the stickers light trail
193469	precision congratulations there's no
196260	turning down okay
198449	Tron gating most kickstart guide so
201389	probably includes things like plug the
203310	USB thing into the other USB thing Tron
206220	Gaming Mouse master guide okay how to
211139	configure the software all that good
213150	stuff you're probably gonna want to
214319	stick with the master guide on this one
215849	I'm thinking on the fly sensitivity
217829	adjustments lighting a lot of gaming
219299	mouse features for like a branded
221400	product love that love it when guys do
225479	this kind of thing properly I mean if
232859	someone released the Pirates of the
234090	Caribbean Mouse or something like that I
235979	bet you'd be surprised if it was good
237689	quality so I mean forgive me for also
240449	being surprised to see like a Tron Mouse
242430	that's really like done well they took
245669	the right company to partner up with in
247439	Razer that's for sure
251180	so the most is quite small that's the
253770	first thing I noticed about it as I take
255360	it out of the out of the packaging there
257519	and that is pretty typical for raisers
259829	gaming mice they tend to prefer like a
262230	claw grip and a small overall shape so
266190	even with my small hands it's not
268650	oversized by any stretch of the
270330	imagination okay so we've got our scroll
273120	wheel here left and right mouse buttons
276660	on this side and then on both sides we
278820	have what I would normally call I love
283530	the finish on this thing look at that
284940	that's cool can you see that okay yeah
287250	you can that's good so you've got back
290490	and forward buttons on both sides of the
293070	mouse so a lot of the time you see
294530	ambidextrous and that's in finger quotes
296880	mice but they only have thumb buttons on
300000	the one side so this one whether you're
301740	holding it in your left or your right
303180	hand you will have full access to both
305610	sets of thumb buttons so that's a pretty
308100	cool feature for the left-handed gamers
310020	out there on the bottom you find their
312270	laser sensor as well as what I like to
314640	call slippy pads we've got a Disney logo
317310	invisible laser radiation do not view
319680	directly with optical instruments okay
321840	that's good stuff to know and then on
323790	the back we find just sort of more
325710	glossy finish more overall cool look to
327750	the mouse you know what we should do
328919	though here pause that first I can bring
330210	you plug it in okay so I'm about to plug
333090	it in this is pretty cool guys get set
335340	for this okay area
342470	is that sweet or what so you've got
346289	glowing sides to the mousewheel and then
348900	you've also got these two glowing bars
351120	here it's a great aesthetic on this
