2190	[Music]
5779	with its factory tuning in data center
8700	DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
11519	amazing choice for gamers and
13200	performance enthusiasts now gigabyte
15690	never really caught my attention with
17430	their peripherals in the past and that's
18990	the reason we haven't covered them much
20369	but this one right here is a little bit
22619	different this is the a via uranium
25019	wireless gaming mouse with ghost macro
27660	station and there are some things about
29429	it that are moderately interesting so
31529	the mouse itself has a 6500 DPI twin eye
34950	gaming laser sensor it can handle a
36930	thousand Hertz polling rate the maximum
38309	that you can do with USB 2 it can handle
40800	50 hours of continuous battery life with
42989	its two double-a batteries and you can
45059	easily swap them out in an emergency or
46920	whatever else the case may be but you
48570	don't even have to do that in an
49620	emergency because it's got a nice
50460	lightweight cord here that you can go
52559	ahead and run to the mouse and you can
53640	actually use it as a wired mouse while
55170	it charges none of these things are
57210	really groundbreaking but the
58710	groundbreaking thing is the ghost macro
61800	station right here that actually has a
63449	full-on OLED display that you can use to
66570	navigate the onboard menus and make a
69750	ton of changes to the mouse itself
72030	without even firing up the software but
74430	first let's take a bit of a visual tour
76500	of the mouse itself so at the front
78390	we've got the charging port that plugs
80280	into that nice lightweight cable I
81869	talked about before on the right hand
83610	side we find not a whole lot of anything
84960	other than a slightly textured but still
87420	a little bit more slippery than I'd like
88799	plastic finish at the back we find its
91409	butt so to speak okay and then on the
94700	left hand side we've got 4gb buttons -
97829	which are bound to forward and back by
99840	default two of which are completely
100860	unbound but any of which you can bind to
103409	whatever you could possibly want on the
105840	bottom we find a couple of slippy pads
107640	four to be precise there are some extra
109439	ones in the Box should you so require as
111240	well as that 6500 DPI 29 laser sensor
114899	we've also got a connect button which
116610	you probably won't even need to use
117960	unless something disastrous happens an
119579	on/off switch and those two nickel metal
121799	hydride rechargeable batteries that are
123659	included with the mouse a very nice
125189	touch on the top we find a scroll wheel
127320	that also supports functionality
129179	something I'm not a huge fan of because
130679	my lazy Mouse posture causes me
132810	accidentally hit it all the time but
134069	lots of people really like it as well as
136230	a rocker switch right here that you can
138599	use for on-the-fly dpi adjustments or
140310	whatever you want a wheel controller
142380	lock that you can use to control the
145050	wheel lock that changes it from being a
148050	mouse wheel to being navigation for this
150540	right here and finally a profile
152910	switching button what I have to say
154980	about the ergonomics are a couple of
156300	things on the side and these ones to the
158700	left of your index finger they're all
160349	surprisingly easy to reach I
161849	particularly like the layout of g4 it's
164910	a very large button and you can either
166470	press it with the tip of your thumb or
167910	just roll onto it with the base of your
169769	thumb pretty much anyone should be able
171299	to access it too however the buttons
174030	under the palm do continue to baffle me
176100	these ones make a little bit more sense
177840	because it's just a profile switcher and
179459	then like a navigation lock here so
180930	presumably you're not gaming while
182010	you're like configuring your mouse or
184440	whatever else so it's better than usual
186599	but I still don't particularly like them
188340	and then on the right hand side the
190049	thing that bothered me here was that the
191880	mouse is just too heavy to claw grip and
195930	then unfortunately even with my small
198989	hands my pinky hangs off the side of the
201090	mouse if I try to Palm it so I really
203190	just had a hard time gripping the mouse
205620	in a way that was that comfortable and
207989	it's unfortunate that it has that
210209	particular drawback because there are
212040	some other things about it that are
213420	really cool many of which pertain to the
216660	ghost macro station itself so moving on
220980	to that it has an extremely bright
223230	easy-to-read OLED display that can have
225329	a ghost logo on it or your own creation
228720	whether it's a bitmap or even hand-drawn
231209	on with the mouse itself something that
232950	I spent more of the time you know while
235650	I was working on this review doing than
237840	I probably should have
238829	it's got onboard memory for macros and
241319	gigabyte claims and it's like a
243269	patent-pending technology for flawless
244980	performance speaking of performance I
247139	had absolutely no complaints about it I
249060	didn't notice any lag or any jumping
251040	even on a high resolution 2560 by 1440
253590	monitor it's got a live editing mode
256410	this is cool no software required all
258660	you have to do is press that wheel lock
261690	button and then you can use the mouse
263520	wheel as a deep
264850	add to navigate forward back up and down
268090	to the menus then you click to confirm
269710	your changes and you can change all
271120	kinds of stuff like dpi values you can
273490	edit profile switch profile well you can
275470	do that through the mouse but you can
276550	could switch profiles if you wanted to
277900	you can assign basic remap functionality
280510	key mapping functionality so you can
282730	bind keyboard functions to your mouse
284980	and you can even assign macros and all
287470	that kind of stuff so software is
289390	available and includes more
291280	functionality such as more granular DPI
294400	control and a pretty robust macro editor
296560	as well as the aforementioned drawing
298510	utility for the screen favored but if
301690	you you don't actually need to use the
303880	software to have really good control the
305680	mouse all the time if you don't want to
308110	I did mention before the nice
309790	lightweight charging cord I can't
311620	emphasize this enough that's a really
313510	good feature to have for a mouse that's
314980	supposed to be Wireless most of the time
316750	and then finally the little Avia logo on
319720	the bottom has five different colors
321340	which indicate which profile you are
323530	operating in this is kind of cool as
325870	much as I might have complained about
327430	the ergonomics of the mouse for myself
329440	on their website they actually have a
331330	hand comfort guide and do recommend a
333460	hand size so I'm usually I'd call Luke
336970	down be like yeah here's what his hand
338320	looks not like on it here's a my hand
339700	looks like on it you know what just head
340960	over to their website see if it's a if
342520	it's a good fit for you and on their
345040	website also what I notice is there's a
346900	lot of marketing around the 4k readiness
349450	of this mouse something that I thought
351850	was a little bit weird but it's actually
353560	a very interesting point when I finally
356170	upgraded from my MX duo I only did it
359290	because I went from my CRT monitor which
361960	I ran at 1280 by 1024 or 960 or whatever
366070	it was to maintain a proper aspect ratio
367720	I went from that to a 1920 by 1200
370930	monitor and I was like oh the DPI is not
373420	high enough so that is an argument for
375880	higher dpi mice however this one isn't
377710	particularly more 4k ready than other
379720	high DPI mice and I just want to make
381610	sure that I also included in the box is
384040	a cleaning cloth the extra mouse feet
386170	that I mentioned before on a via you
388600	know Club B nav a club membership card
391180	there's notes as well as a user's guide
393910	and then the rechargeable batteries that
395229	I have in the mouse already guys thank
