140	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2879	the G 19's this is the first refresh
5940	we've seen for a flagship keyboard from
9240	Logitech since the original G 19 which
11880	added a full-color LCD to the already
15000	awesome features of the G 15 unless you
19109	count the g7 10 plus which is a
20760	mechanical gaming keyboard so the G 19
22680	is not mechanical but it does have their
25170	game panel LCD technology as well as
27570	their new advanced surface materials so
30630	with their new G Series Logitech's sort
32820	of tagline is science wins and the idea
36930	is that by strategically applying better
39660	quality materials and advanced materials
42210	to the products they can make them look
43680	better over time and feel better to use
46260	so inside you find not a whole lot
48450	there's a little Quick Start Guide setup
51210	guide there's a wrist rest and an AC
53610	adapter because it has a built-in
55410	monitor basically it has a built in
57420	screen on it you actually do need to
59550	power this keyboard from the wall in
61230	addition to the USB power but the
63780	advantage to this is that the built-in
66210	USB port on the keyboard itself are not
69180	passive so they don't rely on the power
71790	provided from your computer which means
73710	they are powered ports and you can run
75869	more power-hungry devices off of them
78479	such as things like I don't know USB
80790	speakers or whatever else where a lot of
83130	the time with regular hubs built into
86040	keyboards you do not have that
87930	functionality so on the bottom of the
90479	keyboard
90900	you've got more Logitech C calling their
93030	cable management so you can see here
95189	you're able to route your you know I
97350	don't know whether it's your probably
98400	your headphone cable or whatever else
100140	you want to run through here either
101549	through this side through this edge
103439	through this edge up here down here
105299	wherever you want it to go in fact you
107250	can have things come out wherever you
109170	want down here which is kind of nice
110759	because how many times have you guys
112710	been sitting playing a game and you got
114060	your headset cable over top of your hand
116189	it's just I don't know it's just
117270	annoying right so there you go there's
119430	my little rant about that you can adjust
121560	the angle of the keyboard just by
123090	pulling up these feet here I wouldn't
124740	have minded seeing these with rubber
126930	tops on the ends of them however they
129330	feel pretty sturdy so I don't think even
131700	in a fit of nerd
132890	age they'd be at risk of breaking which
135140	is the only complaint I had about the
137060	g15 Gen one was the the breakable wrist
140630	rest but if logitech's whole thing has
142250	advanced materials I don't think we're
143600	too worried about that anymore
144709	we've got rubber feet here so you don't
146810	generally have to worry about the
148010	keyboard going anywhere so there you go
150980	speaking of advanced materials this does
153500	feel different from what I'm used to on
155690	a wrist rest so rather than being a
158420	plastic piece with a coating it feels
162470	more like it's a more rugged piece of
165230	plastic so the idea is that it's
166580	supposed to be hydrophobic which makes
168560	it sort of cool to the touch and so that
170570	it's not going to get all greasy and
172070	disgusting looking and then the same
173989	thing on the keyboard itself on the back
176209	or on the faceplate is what they're
178489	calling it that's supposed to be a
179959	fingerprint resistant coating so even
181850	though it's glossy Oh
183830	check that out I don't know how close in
185900	you can get but even if I like try to
188330	leave a fingerprint on it it actually
190130	works so that would be my one complaint
192830	about the g7 10-plus is that the the
195769	glossy faceplate yeah is not that
198110	fingerprint resistant whereas on this
199459	one I really don't see that being an
200930	issue that's very cool
201799	all right so moving on to the features
204970	we've got here is our full-color LCD
208400	display which we can be controlled
210709	either through the software or through
212450	the menu and navigation buttons here
214100	we've also got a game button which will
215840	disable your context menu as well as
217549	your Windows key so that you don't have
219410	to worry about accidentally pressing
220549	them all of these macro buttons can be
222500	recorded on the fly so there's 12 of
224150	them with three different layers so
225440	that's up to 36 different macro
227690	functions and then again you can record
229280	them on the fly so that's pretty fly
232420	sorry the keyboard layout is very
235610	standard long shifts long backspace long
238370	enter so nothing that I'd consider to be
240320	a cardinal sin that would bother me the
242720	WASD Keys are color-coded in a different
245239	color and the backlighting of the
247250	keyboard overall is customizable which
249620	is very cool so you can change the color
251660	to whatever you want that's again done
252980	through the Logitech software over here
254810	on the right side we find the layout is
256430	again very standard so you've got more
258560	gaming color coding for the arrow keys
260660	themselves although I've very rarely
261890	seen folks game with these keys speaking
265070	of gaining key
265790	the keyboard has five key rollover
267710	meaning that no matter what five keys
270620	you press so if you take your entire
272840	hand and kind of go like this they will
274850	all be registered correctly without any
276590	glitchy behavior number pad is pretty
280640	normal the number pad you can like do a
283070	turn key with it and then over here
285050	we've got a volume wheel this is one of
286850	my favorite implementations of volume
288590	control many less expensive keyboards
291230	will implement it as sort of like a
292670	function key with like you know press
295130	press press press press for volume
296240	control
296810	I love the wheel implementation because
298940	it's very natural to use you've also got
300650	a mute button as well as play stop back
302630	and forward and then your LED brightness
304850	can be controlled here now I think any
307070	kind of video of the G 19's is going to
310100	be incomplete without actually taking
312170	the thing and plugging it into a
313010	computer so I'd like to do that but
314810	beforehand I'm just going to let our
317900	camera operator who goes by the thuggish
321080	name of b-roll go look at it while I
325730	figure out if there's anything that I
327110	actually missed already advanced surface
329930	materials game desktop mode five gear
332270	rollover dedicated media control
333560	intelligent cable management and a three
335300	year warranty there I haven't covered
336890	that yet we'll be back in a moment so
339980	here we are with the G 19's set up in
342380	it's sort of natural environment which
344360	is of course right next to a g7 ten plus
347000	now I want you to get in nice and close
349550	to the g7 ten plus and check out these
351920	greasy marks around the arrow keys here
354350	there's pretty much nothing you can do
356240	about that on the g7 10 plus whereas can
359060	you see that at all yep okay whereas
361480	with the G 19's no matter what I do to
364850	it other than this spot right here this
367040	will this will still get dirty but these
368690	spots right here due to the coating on
370610	it you can see that it doesn't end up
372290	looking gross because of what they've
374720	done here so that I thought that was
375980	really cool that was sort of their point
379070	with this keyboard but there you go so
380990	okay so this button it turns out
382460	actually controls the LCD here and then
385490	let's go ahead and a so the backlighting
388310	is it's a white backlight on here right
390050	now but I've got the Logitech Gaming
392120	software going right here so I mean
393919	Logitech really does have the most
395360	refined software to go with there
397500	peripherals so you can see it with the
399240	three logitech things that I have
400950	built-in I can go okay well I want to
405000	select which things I want so I can have
407460	a YouTube video player for the LCD here
409380	I can have an LCD webcam Bureau that's
411090	kind of cool so you could like webcam
412800	with your mom while you're actually
414420	gaming and you could just have her here
416220	sort of tucked away application button
420750	will either list the running applet so
422940	here let's try the application button
424230	which is this guy right here okay so
427440	that controls the applets that are
429510	running on the LCD screen here itself so
431970	we can go ahead and I don't know we'll
433140	go to the the video player so we'll go
434820	to top-rated how to be beautiful from
437460	PewDiePie
438150	oh no that can only be a bad thing okay
441030	no flash player not installed cancel
443700	cancel ah go back go back okay so this
447480	is just to browse the YouTube videos
449720	well either way we don't want to watch
451860	PewDiePie as a video about how to be
454140	beautiful so let's go ahead and check
456450	out the software so there's also
457470	lighting controls that you can change so
460110	let's go ahead and kill the house lights
461790	and I'll show you guys that we can
463680	change the LEDs to pretty much whatever
465750	color we want Diesel's hitting the
469530	lights for me just using the software
471030	control panel here so we can go ahead
472830	and go like that so all of a sudden
474840	we've got a blue / green backlight we
477690	can go like this and we end up with a
479130	very deep blue very customizable you can
481740	control the brightness as well so here's
483720	what it looks like full red here's the
485820	brightness control so it has looks like
488870	Wow a lot of different brightness steps
492210	I've seen keyboards brag about 10
494580	different steps of brightness but this
496140	is pretty much linear control you can
498600	also quickly select you can have oh you
500610	can have different backlight colors per
502050	profile so your profiles are up here so
504720	you can see that it's already set up
505830	that way so I'm switching between those
507540	is changing the colors and then of
509520	course you can set up all the usual
511020	stuff that you can do in Logitech
512219	software like setting up profiles per
514740	game and it really is a very complete
517740	list that they have compared to what
519210	other guys are doing as well as
520380	programming all the different keys and
521940	all the different layers per key right
523770	here onboard memory is controlled here
527430	so that's how you can save profiles
529080	directly to the keyboard itself
531240	and I think that pretty much wraps it up
