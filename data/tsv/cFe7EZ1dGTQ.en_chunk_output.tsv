0	the easy way to do this video would be
2220	to explain that the sensei wireless is
4319	basically the sensei with like an
6330	upgraded sensor that goes up to 8200 CPI
8670	natively and 50 CPI increments and up to
10889	16,000 400 TPI with the SteelSeries
13170	Engine 3 software it's and fancy
14610	interpolation although I doubt any of
16500	that would be necessary since you can
17730	own 1440p monitor anything that high
19590	will be beyond being able to control but
22710	they also removed a wire so I guess
25380	we'll need a full video for this with
33960	its factory tuning and data center DNA
36300	and Intel 730 series SSD is an amazing
39270	choice for gamers and performance
41129	enthusiasts so let's open up with a
43649	physical tour of the mouse my immediate
45719	impression was one of relief that
47789	SteelSeries has ditched the glossy
49920	plastic of the sensei and gone back to a
52289	soft touch finished like the zai in the
54390	iqari series bravo steel series hard
56969	plastic is sucky and I really like this
59070	implementation now a tour of the buttons
61289	they are all completely remappable with
63719	a pretty comprehensive list of
65220	individual commands or macros that can
67740	be set up with no delay a recorded delay
69390	or a predetermined delay and starting on
71850	the top we've got your standard left and
73710	right click with a middle click scroll
75150	wheel that has a very satisfying
76439	resistance as you scroll and a great
78540	rubber texture some people will be
80520	turned off by the fact that that scroll
82170	wheel does not include tilt but
83820	personally I find till a little bit hard
85500	to use without accidentally clicking it
87090	anyway so I don't miss it and then
88829	finally the last button on top is a CPI
90840	toggle that you can use in a sniper mode
92400	if you want or reprogram it to whatever
94259	else if you want anyway on the sides the
97079	mouse is ambidextrous so there are two
98880	buttons on each side for your pinky or
101310	your thumb depending on whether you're a
102930	righty or a southpaw and then finally on
105390	the bottom you've got the sensor
106560	charging contacts for the internal
107970	battery a power switch a connect button
109380	that I never had to use and finally a
111210	cable lock for when you want to switch
113490	to Wired mode a nice touch in terms of
117090	customizability the mouse has three
119189	different lighting zones each of which
120570	can be used to indicate battery status
122490	with green yellow and red color codes or
125100	be configured to glow any color you want
127200	with either a steady glow or a breathing
129360	effect the zones are on the sides of the
131400	scroll wheel the SteelSeries logo at the
133590	back
133980	and finally around the outside of the
136980	base station where the mouse goes on top
139019	of it speaking at the base station I
140580	actually really like the implementation
142680	here there's only so much you can do to
145170	make a mouse feel premium without making
148140	it heavy
149310	so SteelSeries have thrown that
151319	premiumness into the base station it's a
153480	flat charging dock that has a really
155880	high end you know nice heft to its
158220	construction with a thick aluminum top
159989	plate and then a great rubberized grip
161970	II bottom so it's not going to go
163260	anywhere it's flat so the mouse is very
165840	easy to put in place and have it be
168330	charging and the braided cable that
170400	plugs into it looks and feels nice and
172590	not only that but it acts as an
174150	auxiliary cord for the mouse as well now
177120	I would have preferred an additional
180720	cable that goes from the base station to
183120	the mouse so that you don't have to
184860	unplug and then replug the mouse in
187500	while switching and wait for it to be
188849	readit ected but maybe we'll get a
190530	feature like that in revision 2
192090	somewhere down the line back on the
194610	subject of the weight of the mouse
195930	though the sensei Wireless is on the
198090	heavy side at about a hundred and
199440	seventeen grams and considering that
201840	compared to other you know competitive
204329	gaming mice it needs a battery then I
206459	guess that weight seems pretty
207870	reasonable I mean it's almost exactly
209519	the same as the logitech g502 without
211829	any added weights which is a wired mouse
213510	and only about five grams more than the
215430	old sensei but as an old-school akari
218730	laser user I might have liked something
221010	a bit lighter with an optional weight
223200	system if they could swing it again I
225150	understand the constraints given that it
226859	is Wireless and that's about it for
229889	hardware so let's move on to the
231299	software SteelSeries engine has evolved
233069	a lot and supports an unlimited number
234989	of profiles now that you can trigger
236549	with application or game launches with
238200	the usual suspect adjustments such as
240660	lift distance angle snapping polling
242670	rate and acceleration control in there
244380	as well that's all old stuff though the
246660	big new feature that's being introduced
248310	with the sensei wireless but actually
249780	works with other devices as well is
251430	SteelSeries cloud it basically just
253200	syncs your profiles across devices
255329	whenever you sign into SteelSeries
256889	engine 3 in much the same way that
258690	competing solutions do with a big part
260608	of the pitch being that you aren't being
262380	forced to use it if you do decide to use
265229	it the sign up process takes a few
266580	seconds and they just
267550	ask for a name email address and
269169	password you can give them your birthday
271060	and gender if you want but if you don't
272020	feel like it you just press skip neat
273690	final thoughts time since it weighs
276789	about the same until the best of my
279099	ability to perceive it performs exactly
280930	the same as an equivalent Wired Gaming
283569	Mouse there are only a couple of things
285280	to really discuss in this conclusion
286750	first is the convenience of being able
289990	to use it from the couch aside whether I
291909	think it's worth it to deal with the
293740	hassle of recharging versus the hassle
296229	of cord drag to start with the 16 hour
299199	battery life is not very impressive well
301990	it's enough for any but the most
303310	hardcore gaming sessions and a flat easy
307060	to align aesthetically pleasing charger
309849	is a heck of a lot better than a finicky
311889	one like the one that came with my first
313780	wireless mouse in the Logitech MX duo
315870	hardcore gamers will have to charge
318460	their mouse every day or two or keep an
320349	eye on the colored battery indicator to
321940	avoid needing to switch to Wired mode
323440	from time to time something that would
325180	bother me less if it wasn't for the
326919	whole readit ection thing the second is
329440	the controversial continued use of laser
333009	sensors that most massive dpi or CPI
336370	ratings but are known to have
338409	acceleration even if you turn it off
340449	compared to less expensive optical
343000	sensors like the Pixar 3090 and 3310
345430	that do not I understand that it puts
348009	SteelSeries in an awkward position since
349990	they'd be saving only a couple of bucks
352090	on the sensor so they'd be trying to
353979	market a hundred and fifty dollar
355449	wireless mouse that doesn't have
356909	top-of-the-line specs in every category
359229	against their competitors and I realize
361719	that a big part of the problem is the
363190	consumers who are mindlessly shopping by
365680	bigger numbers or whatever about some
368259	pro player I think these cool uses but I
371289	would like to see SteelSeries use the
373900	most appropriate hardware rather than
375819	what sounds better
376659	I wouldn't ask this of just anyone but I
378940	think SteelSeries leaders that they are
381370	in the gaming peripheral space have a
382840	responsibility to invest in educating
385300	gamers about the real world gaming
387759	experience that a perfect sensor
389560	delivers versus one with amped up CPI
392529	but maybe most people will think I'm
395949	just being a crusader over nothing here
397750	I mean if you're using a laser mouse
399460	already and it's not
400510	bothering you then this one won't bother
402310	you either so if you like everything
404320	else about it the overall performance of
406570	the sensei Wireless can't be faulted
408190	enjoy your new gaming mouse if you've
