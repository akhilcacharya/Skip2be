60	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2669	the funk ns3 so their slogan is
5640	functionality perfected so you're
7259	probably not going to find 8200 dpi
9570	sensors and you know 57 buttons and
13259	whatever else but the idea behind this
14969	mouse was to create something that was
17990	usable so check this up packaging is
22439	very clean so let's do the back first so
24990	you've got him optimal in range button
28500	placements from our accurate gameplay so
30029	the idea is that there's not a ton of
31500	buttons but you could reach them all
32759	built to last them only the best
34380	components available to keep your comfy
35850	grip allows you to keep focused on the
37920	screen so it's a palm type mouse
40040	customizable LED lighting system with
42239	profile indication okay so there's RGB
44579	lighting which is basically just there
46260	and there switch instantly to another
47940	dpi by holding down the instant aim
49770	button so it's got an aim button for a
51660	sniper button or whatever sort of a lot
53670	of different guys have called that
55190	alright
56370	him it all started back in 1999 in sunny
59340	California a bunch of passionate gamers
61230	and friends got fed up with computer
62910	gear not cutting it like anyone serious
64799	about his business these guys decided it
66420	was time to take action
67409	they were visionaries free thinkers and
68790	entrepreneurs and thank God Steve Jobs
71159	came along and invented the modern
72600	gaming mouse in sunny California in 1999
75200	actually that's not really what happened
77610	there but the point is that there were
79830	some guys they founded funk and they
82080	wanted to create stuff that was good
83610	enough for them to use it so funk was
86159	kind of m.i.a for a little bit there but
88770	it has been resurrected and this is
91650	pretty much the first product that's
93540	come out of the rejuvenated company so
98729	let's go ahead and open this bad boy up
100259	you can open it up from either side I
101820	chose the right because that's how I
103560	roll I make decisions and I just go for
105750	it spec wise what have they got to say
108689	for themselves
109409	Omron switches so that's in line with
111119	funk saying that they're using only the
112770	highest quality materials on run
114240	switches are very very well regarded but
117930	let's just this is funny check us out
119670	they actually call out the exact
121439	processor they're using a vago UGS 9500
124710	okay so our sorry sensor and then the
127290	processor is a WT 65 73 onboard memory
130848	512 kilobytes resolution
133500	9250 670 dpi that is a huge range and
136750	that goes all the way down very very low
138330	1,200 frames per second tracking speed
140530	five point one meters per second I think
141819	there's pretty much everything in here
143470	the only thing that I've seen that is
145150	not here so you can have up to thousand
147040	hours polling rate is that that thing
150340	that logitech's doing now where they
151750	actually rate the feet on the bottom of
153310	the mice for a particular distance that
156849	they can travel 250 kilometers on their
159220	latest a GS series mice so let's go
162730	ahead and check out the actual mouse
164470	itself so it's much wider than what you
167680	might be used to if you've seen a few
169360	sort of modern gaming mice because a lot
172209	of the mice out there it seems like
174069	manufacturers are hedging their bets a
175989	little bit and saying okay well if we
178060	build something smaller than some people
182170	with small hands we'll be able to palm
183700	it and people with big hands will be
185560	able to claw it whereas funk has gone
187870	okay no we're going to build something
189160	bigger so that people with bigger hands
191170	can palm it and people with smaller
192940	hands can palm it slightly less so what
195340	you'll notice is that I have small hands
197170	and while my hand does fit comfortably
199450	on the MS 3 you can see that I'm not
201250	nearly to the end of the buttons here or
204010	to the rests for the ring finger and the
207340	pinky finger and you can see here on the
209709	other side I'm also not able to reach
212049	the sniper button necessarily so the MS
214540	3 is optimized for people with bigger
216400	hands such as slick who's on his way
218440	over here right now to show us what his
220599	larger hands will look like on the MS 3
223389	thank you slick for stepping in and
225549	doing what I can't do so ah you know
228489	what the mics on so feel free to to talk
230739	I still kind of claw it actually but I
233980	can palm it a lot easier than those
236200	place okay so here let's do a quick size
238359	comparison sort of slicks hand versus
240639	mine so baseball glove lady hand so
245560	somewhere in between is probably where
247629	you're going to find the perfect balance
249400	with the ns3 now let's go ahead and
252010	cover all the buttons that are on here
253449	so we've got four buttons that are
255609	accessible with the thumb for me
257500	personally I'd be able to do one two
259389	three of them this one's a bit stiffer
261760	than these two you can actually hear
265630	there's a distinctly different clicks
267220	to them and then this one is more of a
269410	spring-loaded sort of type of feel of
271150	button just like this one right here two
273460	buttons on the top all of these can be
276300	reprogrammed from within the funk
278530	software as well as a non-tilting but
281950	pressable scroll wheel and an additional
284380	button over here on the right of your
286750	ring finger now I personally prefer this
289000	positioning for a button that's going to
291430	be intended to be pressed by moving off
293290	either my left to right click because
295300	I've seen one's position here a lot of
297010	the time and I personally left-click a
298420	lot more than I right click so I would
300340	rather move this off to the side then
302470	move this off to the side with that said
304300	my hands are slightly too small to reach
306880	that button on the end so guys if your
309700	hands are a little bit on the bigger
310780	side you have probably found your new
313270	mouse the bottom is covered in a glossy
315640	finish that also has slippy pads right
318070	here here here here and here and you can
320500	see the laser sensor right here through
322900	the bottom of the mouse itself the
324669	braided cable is 2 meters long and has a
327580	nice little sort of black and orange
330100	finish to it so hopefully you guys can
331810	get a good look at that and then it does
333580	have the gold plated USB connector
335169	although it should be noted that that
336430	doesn't actually do anything for the
337990	performance it's mostly just for show I
340570	mean with that said it's not like it
342040	costs a ton and funks charging you an
343630	extra $25 because they put a gold-plated
345700	connector on it so I wouldn't worry too
347530	much about it from that perspective but
348910	yeah it doesn't actually affect the
350320	performance too much the important thing
352090	well not at all is to have gold plated
354580	inside here not the outside of the
357190	connector where nothing actually happens
358870	except I believe it's a ground but
361630	that's about it so thank you for
363940	checking out my unboxing and first look
365710	at the funk ms3 don't forget to
367180	subscribe - tech tips from more
368440	unboxings reviews and other computer
369880	videos and oh yeah the last thing I
371979	should probably mention about it is it
373030	has a really nice soft touch feel over
375100	the entire Mouse with the exception of
376690	the bottom and the buttons on the top
378280	that feels really good here that should
382419	give you guys some idea of what the
383560	texture is like and actually looks
384910	really good as well thanks guys so yeah
388120	a couple things I missed the 512 K
390100	memory holds up to 3 different profiles
392050	and it's a driverless mouse so you can
393850	just plug it in and it works the way you
395950	intend it to honestly the minute I
398289	switched to my Akari laser
400330	prior to that I'd had a non driverless
402009	mouse I gave up on my student driver
404500	list every mouse should have onboard
405849	memory these days and the last thing is
408159	it can record up to 20 actions with a
410830	macro so there you go
412150	using the editor shut up crow so we just
419110	finished filming this and diesel the
420639	intern apparently wants the smell snow
422979	to swap out on his workstation so there
425289	you go
