30	back in March of 2017 algata released
2820	the stream deck an utterly unique 15 key
5670	keypad with screens on each key designed
8519	for live-streaming it's caught
10050	integration with OBS twitch Twitter
12389	windows algata
13950	on products and in August 2017 they
16859	added xsplit allowing for us to finally
19500	use the stream deck for our weekly
21210	podcast the wine show but I rarely
24390	stream so why is my Twitter feed full of
27390	requests to review this thing I'll tell
29699	you why because they know I don't care
32340	what anything was designed to do I care
35730	about what it can do and so as the king
38879	of macros I'll be looking at this
40950	product from two angles its intended use
43410	and how I use it
47400	[Music]
53070	Tunnel bear makes really simple privacy
55600	apps so people can enjoy a more open
57400	Internet to try tunnel bear free go to
59440	tunnel bear comm /l tt opening up the
62350	stream Dex software for the first time
64030	you'll be greeted by a bunch of actions
65890	on the right just drag them onto the
67900	buttons on the left try them out in real
69729	life and they all pretty much work
71620	exactly as you might expect you can
73780	control your twitch chat post
75370	pre-written messages on Twitter change
77500	scenes sources and mics in OBS and
79930	xsplit take screenshots record your
82390	screen and even record the last X
84790	minutes retroactively Lee if you also
87160	have an elgato capture card suite and
89740	there's a whole lot more but you might
91900	be thinking wait teryn can't we already
94090	do all that stuff using keyboard
95950	shortcuts well no not all of it for one
99100	thing
99580	keyboard shortcuts aren't always easy to
101229	remember and depending on your game they
103630	can end up conflicting with other
105009	commands furthermore because of the
107259	magic of API integrations it can even do
109840	things like toggling slow mode in twitch
112509	chat without you having to manually alt
115030	tab to the chat window and position your
117429	cursor and then alt tab back to where
120100	you were so the stream deck just makes
122470	it a lot easier to execute these
124390	commands when you're live-streaming a
126460	game or whatever else and I was also
128889	pretty impressed by the ease of the
130660	setup and configuration process but
133180	let's go deeper
134200	what if 15 actions isn't enough for you
136510	fear not
137740	you can put actions in folders to fit up
140709	to 210 actions onto a single stream deck
143860	wait did I say 210 I mean unlimited a
147940	recent update allows you to nest folders
150100	inside of other folders dog anyway
153640	what's the stream deck like to use while
155770	streaming not sure what to tell you
157750	without sounding repetitive assuming
159670	you've set everything up correctly it
161140	works exactly as you'd expect also the
164260	automatic dimming of inactive scenes and
166750	sources makes it really easy to tell
168790	what's going on just by glancing at the
170680	stream deck it just works so for serious
174160	streamers the value is pretty clear and
176380	that's been thoroughly covered by people
178900	who are a lot more into that scene with
181180	that said it wouldn't be a terran video
183129	without a list of complaints and such
185310	questions so here we go the current GUI
187709	doesn't make it obvious that you can
189090	right click here to get more options the
191250	web-based image creator is cool but it
193200	requires you to save an image onto your
195030	computer before you can put it onto the
196739	stream deck which adds an extra step the
198840	integrated cord is too short
200670	the concave key caps can cause
202170	reflections making the screens hard to
204090	read there's significant parallax on the
206519	keys which combined with the stands
208440	limited adjustability means that finding
210810	a good viewing angle can be quite
212370	difficult the stand flops around when
214890	you pick it up and it also doesn't
216360	really work in portrait mode which is
218310	also not supported in the software one
220709	of my units suffered from image
222209	retention which Elgato insists is rare
224880	having never been a hardware issue but I
227610	still wish there was an automatic sleep
229380	mode I wish we had options for font size
231870	color and position and simple background
234420	colors on the keys I wish I could
236640	dynamically change a keys image and
238680	function based upon say an ini file
241980	somewhere as controlled by a script of
244110	my own making I wish that multiple
246180	stream decks per computer were supported
248310	and I wish that gifts were supported
250350	even though it would mostly just be used
252390	for fun but despite all this I still
255090	really like the stream deck and I've
256798	been using it daily at work for several
258870	months now but not for twitch streaming
261238	I use it for video editing and folder
264030	navigation you may have seen my DIY 87
267330	macro keyboard video a while ago there
269580	have been several developments since
271770	then and I have more macro keys on my
274320	desk than ever before so the stream deck
277050	fits in perfectly its windows
279240	integration means that you can assign
280830	websites hotkeys and even the direct
283289	opening of programs scripts or files an
286280	extremely powerful feature in the right
288720	hands and these are the right hands wink
292410	so after painstakingly restructuring all
295560	of my autohotkey scripts to work in such
298020	a way that individual functions with
300090	parameters could be launched directly
302070	from single keys on the stream deck I
304650	was able to consolidate my peripherals
306900	from this to this and all of the code
310650	for that is on my github link below by
312780	the way I only did it that way because I
314370	literally ran out of key combinations
316349	but you can probably just use the
318630	key command and have that trigger a
320250	script that's a lot more simple now if a
323070	hundred and fifty dollars sounds too
324660	expensive and you don't think you need
327000	all these features you certainly could
329430	create a poor man's stream deck by
332790	binding some keyboard shortcuts onto a
334770	decent numpad like this one and you
337200	could use auto hotkey for application
339570	directing and/or detection
341640	you could also add Lua macros or
343980	interception to make it independent from
346080	the normal numpad and then you could
348990	print out little images onto envelopes
351570	stamps cut them out and paste them onto
354060	the keys you would end up with something
356100	that looks like this and for only $17
359160	but it's a real pain to get all of that
362040	working so while it is more expensive I
365010	definitely consider the stream deck
366990	worthwhile for productivity freaks you
369630	guys know who you are and serious
371760	streamers alike I still wish it
374220	supported gifts though but you know what
376710	else doesn't support gifts the masked
379290	drop exclusive sennheiser HD 6 XX
381960	headphones currently available for only
384600	two hundred dollars with free shipping
386010	to the USA these are based on the
388290	Sennheiser HD 650s which are still
390300	widely considered to be the best
391710	headphones under $1000 buy the
393390	audiophile community they sound smooth
395640	and laid-back with balanced mid-range
397530	and a natural sounding bass sorry I mean
400110	bass there have been no adjustments to
402270	the sound signature from the HD 650 to
404280	the HD 6x X the visual aesthetic has
407160	been updated to a deep midnight blue
408800	with black name plates they've got soft
411960	ear pads with elliptical ear cups that
413790	follow the ear and a detachable 6 foot
416190	cable so go check them out on mass drop
418200	at the link below thanks for watching
420030	give the video a like dislike get
422670	subscribed get bailed or don't whatever
425310	you can buy the stream deck on Amazon if
427650	you want also check out our merch store
429540	and community forum you have so many
