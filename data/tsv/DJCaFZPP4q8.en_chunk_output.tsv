60	well it's been a little while since I've
2100	had a look at a zombie gear product but
4080	today I have these our gear swift
6270	it is a genuine gaming surface and I'm
9090	going to zoom in on that so you can see
10620	exactly how genuine it is I don't know
13590	if you can actually read that that's
15150	good even closer zowie gear swift
17070	genuine gaming surface so if you are a
19230	genuine gamer this is probably your
21390	surface all right why don't we go around
23160	to the back of the box where you will
24840	discover more about it it is made of a
28859	complex plastic compound so as you may
31710	or may not have gathered already this is
33840	a plastic mousepad okay the next thing
36690	about it of note is the fact that it is
40340	textured so it combines speed precision
43050	and control there's a fast mousepad
44579	hence the name Swift okay it has a
46800	rubber base so it doesn't move you can
49140	refresh it with water so you can clean
51149	it with water and rounded edges for a
53610	higher level of comfort so it's not
55050	gonna like cut your wrists while you're
56699	moving your mouse around and it is
58559	tested and approved for all types of
60449	mice and I was actually I did as a gear
63420	on boxing win a while back and I was
65850	criticized for not knowing who this guy
67650	is I said that he looked like some
70619	random guy he's a dude yeah the
73049	backwards cap or something along those
74340	lines and this is apparently a disome at
77460	spawn Mohammed and he wants to use his
79590	gaming experience to develop products
81180	for all the different types of gamers he
82500	has tested it with optical and laser
84689	mice and finds it to be up to his
87000	meticulous standards so I apologize for
89369	not knowing who that was before now I
91259	know he's a professional gamer alright
94049	so why don't I get this seal broken and
96840	we'll get this thing out of the box
98759	because that's what this is it is an
100829	unboxing this is the box and this is it
104420	undecide alright so then we have a piece
107790	of paper covering the back of the
109380	mousepad
109829	alright and this is actually a lot nicer
112799	looking in person enough than it was
116090	through a box so that's why I'm boxing
119490	is so important because you can actually
120990	see if any no I have actually got a
123180	mouse kicking around here
124490	where is it oh yeah okay I've actually
126649	got a um here's a
128270	SteelSeries what is this this is a 5l
131569	and then I've got a lot to catch g7 so
133910	you can see for our size comparison the
136730	Swift is a little bit taller than a 5l
140330	but also not quite as wide okay so you
143239	can see the five ball sticks up behind
144560	but the Swift is a little bit taller and
146450	let's have a look at the at the rubber
149349	material on the bottom so the final uses
152720	SteelSeries trademarked uh like random
155120	splashes of rubber on the back which is
156830	quite effective and the Swift uses oh
159799	this is this is kind of clever too
161239	they've got their their logo kind of all
164450	over the place and it's in little thin
167180	thin bits of rubberized in this so you
170420	see once I put this down you see once I
174440	put this down there is like no way it's
176780	going to move terribly important Wow
179510	even it's like stuck to the table a
181370	little bit you can refresh with water as
184220	they mentioned a couple times on the box
186500	alright so I'm going to do this and that
192079	should give you some idea that it is
193609	slippery my g7 feet are in fairly
196549	horrible conditions so okay you know
200150	what just for the heck of it because I
202100	don't really know how to compare a mouse
204109	in an unboxing or a mousepad I should
206480	say there's the five element I can't
209000	tell if there's a difference but I can
211130	tell you right now that based on just
212870	this this quick test I don't know what
215359	the tracking would be like but the 5l is
216829	a slightly slower mousepad and I mean
219560	that makes sense given that is actually
221120	a a plastic coated cloth surface whereas
224090	this is a pure plastic surface it's
226489	quite rigid okay so it's not all that
229400	flexible which is probably a good thing
232040	because I know it might my desk at work
233810	it drives me crazy uh there's actually
236269	like it's it's got a plastic table it's
238700	like just a work table that I sort of
240310	snagged at some point I remember how it
242840	happened and it's not quite even so if I
245209	use anything that's not a very hard
247010	mousepad I actually use an SP at work
248950	then it as I move my mouse across it
252319	goes
253090	it's not not very nice anyway thank you
255970	for checking out my unboxing of the Zoe
258339	Swift blue gaming mouse pad endorsed by
262919	spawn the gamer and I'm looking for my
266110	remote and this is not happening for me
267790	here so I'll just pretend
