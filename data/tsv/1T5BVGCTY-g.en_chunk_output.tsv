0	Razors making some pretty bold claims
3060	about their black widow ultimate 2014
5670	when you consider that on the surface it
8010	appears to be entirely unchanged from
11849	their last generation flagship is there
14549	really innovation left in mechanical
16560	keyboards I guess we'll find out with
26730	its factory tuning and data center DNA
29070	and Intel 730 series SSD is an amazing
32040	choice for gamers and performance
33899	enthusiasts first up is the packaging
36780	which razors reviewers guide informs me
39000	is the way to tell the new Black Widow
41010	ultimate from the old one and that it's
43170	great because of the cleaner lines and
45000	new artwork but none of that really
47039	matters to me because razor missed one
48899	small nearly insignificant detail
51300	it doesn't say 2014 edition anywhere on
55289	it I sure wish whatever product naming
57570	school razor and Apple's iPad team went
60059	to would go away razor I've told you
63030	guys this already but come on I don't
65220	care if you ran out of snake spiders and
67080	mythical creatures different products
69299	need to have different names or at least
71580	numbers that clearly indicate the
73619	revision or generation of the product to
75720	your customers anyway with that out of
78270	the way let's get into the important
79830	differences razor has done and under the
82290	hood update that turns the Black Widow
83790	ultimate into a completely different
86100	beast
86820	gone are the Cherry MX blue and brown
89670	switches we're used to finding on their
91770	clicky and stealth versions and they've
94020	been replaced by what Razer is calling
96060	Razer mechanical switches in green and
99180	orange variants respectively so your
101909	first reaction to this is probably what
104100	the devil is a Razer mechanical switch
105840	and honestly I said the same thing the
108600	answer is both simple and complicated
110970	the simple version for Razer is that
112890	they recognize that the key switch
114509	designs on the market were optimized for
117299	a great typing experience and while they
119880	happened to be superior for gaming to
122070	membrane key switches especially if you
124259	pre sorted them or bin them from the
126030	factory like razors been doing gaming
128280	isn't what they were designed for that
130770	is why they set out to create the first
133180	which is made from the ground up for
135189	gaming the complicated version is that
138370	in addition to what I just said
139900	Cherry MX switches are expensive and
142590	constantly in short supply and cherries
145780	patent on their MX keys which is very
147700	recently expired
149079	so now elements of that design can be
151390	used by other companies without any
153489	legal ramifications and RAZR can move
156099	from having their key switches made at
158230	Cherry corporations factories in Germany
160299	to less expensive manufacturers in China
162579	such as kale or even build their own
165190	facility if they wanted to now to be
168099	clear I'm not saying that razors new key
170409	switches are a Chinese cherry clone
172840	because while the design bears many
174970	similarities to Cherry MX it is
176889	different and the changes are positive
179019	ones
179500	first up the actuation point the exact
182650	position where the downward keystroke is
184930	registered by the computer is Specht
187120	point three millimeters higher this has
189819	the obvious effect of making your key
192189	presses register sooner when you press
194290	down and it also moves the actuation
196450	point itself three millimeters closer to
199599	the reset point or the position when you
202150	let go where the key is ready to be
204190	activated again both of these things are
206440	designed to improve the keyboards
208180	responsiveness which is definitely good
210280	another effect of this is applicable to
213430	razors clicky green key switch not to be
216310	confused with Cherry MX greens totally
218470	different and that is that it moves the
221079	actuation point closer to where the
223329	tactile bump is felt by the user meaning
227440	it's easier to feel when you've
229750	successfully pressed the key without
231579	needing to bottom it out or press the
234400	key all the way down to be sure this has
237190	perhaps less relevance for typists but
240069	for gamers it makes double tapping or
242019	any other quick repetitive actions
243609	easier to do by feel next up their
247659	design calls for more gold on the
249819	contacts which razer determined allows
252129	an increase in the rated durability on
254139	each key from 50 million keystrokes to
256750	60 million keystrokes and finally they
259839	are improving quality by employing their
262089	own QA staff on the factory floor to
264940	achieve a
266270	eight four millimeter variants in
267889	pre-travel distance versus Cherry's
269750	point six millimeter variants this
272030	should improve the consistency and
273319	feeling from one keyboard to another and
275389	even across all the keys on a single
278120	keyboard not being a leet hacks or gamer
280849	like the eSports players who Razer has
282860	had testing the keyboard since last year
284990	I didn't notice the raised actuation
287569	point much but I also really didn't find
290690	anything to complain about the green
292819	Razer key switch keyboard here
294409	definitely felt different from my ducky
297110	shine 3 with cherry MX blues but it
299780	didn't feel much different and in fact
301819	if I didn't know I was using different
304310	switches I would have guessed it was
306199	just batch to batch variants between
308210	blues rather than a completely different
310669	manufacturer but I really like Cherry MX
313610	blues so if they feel like blues to us
316190	regular folks but they have added
317870	benefits for more demanding users then
319880	that's great
320539	now Cherry's pitch for their switches is
323870	unparalleled quality due to German
326300	manufacturing but if Razer solution to
329240	combat notoriously inconsistent Chinese
331550	build quality is to submit their own
333789	specifications and put their own staff
336289	on the floor for quality control then I
338479	think ultimately the question gamers
341300	need to ask themselves is this are you
344389	buying a keyboard or a key switch do you
347210	really need to know where the bread came
349940	from you know at Subway
351860	if the sandwich artisan delivers a
354650	delicious and nutritious sandwich to you
356690	do you need to know where Razer is
358849	sourcing each individual component of
361430	their keyboard or do you trust Razer to
363620	deliver you an exceptional product as
365060	long as they're overseeing the
366349	manufacturing leave your comments under
368479	the video and let me know your thoughts
371120	speaking of exceptional products I spent
373490	so much time talking about the key
374930	switches that I haven't actually given
376639	too much information about the keyboard
378169	itself it's got fully programmable keys
380539	and five additional gaming keys with
382880	support for on-the-fly macro recording
384740	individual / key backlighting with 13
387800	levels of brightness all the way from
389810	off to a phenomenally vibrant beautiful
392779	green it's got media keys with the
395029	function key to control them on the
396770	right so it takes up less prize
398990	Gaming real estate on the left side of
400670	the keyboard ten key rollover so you're
402830	not going to have to worry about
403670	ghosting and both USB and audio
406760	pass-through ports over here on the
408890	right-hand side the build quality of the
410870	keyboard is solid as we've come to
412730	expect and the matte black finish is
414730	fantastic a huge improvement over some
416990	of their previous designs that used
418400	glossy plastic if I had to point out
420710	something I don't like about the design
422600	all I really came up with is that
424970	there's no wrist rest included but that
427040	is becoming a more common thing in
429920	general and I guess I don't like this at
432560	cymbal very much
433790	seriously razor but like what is that
435320	but anyway all things considered those
438350	are really minor complaints and if this
440690	product is an indication of the kind of
442490	more affordable mechanical keyboards
444680	that will be available for gamers with
446690	these switches which are not exclusive
449090	to Razer in any way they're saying well
450980	yeah sure whoever can use them then I
453320	think the future is very exciting
