30	so one of the jokes that cameraman and I
3410	often joke about and that he actually
5730	joked about before we started this video
8160	is the selling point of more technology
11580	because I went to buy some badminton
13139	shoes once and he was with me and I
15900	asked the guy what's the difference
17190	between this one and this one for $10
19109	more on the guy said all this one more
20490	technology and I went well what other
22109	technologies that he had he's like oh no
23430	a smart technology I'm like okay well
25260	I'll take the other one since clearly
26369	there's no difference between these
27840	shoes so cameraman pointed out before I
30630	started to hate you unbox this before
32279	and I'm like no no this is a more
33960	different one he says what does it have
35880	more technology inside I said actually
37380	no it does because unlike the regular
40320	Razer Naga the Razer Naga epic elite MMO
43739	gaming mouse features wireless
45510	technology which is more technology by
47550	the way as well as interchangeable grip
50489	technology which is well not really
53370	technology it was more of an accessory
55079	so let's start getting this thing unbox
57090	so that we can have a look at the
58350	product itself this is actually an open
62070	box product at NCIX so I won't be
63960	breaking any seals today but you should
65610	pretty much get the point so the first
67619	thing we find inside is the Razer Naga
69570	epic which you can clearly see does not
71850	have a cord attached more on that in a
74250	bit
74430	next we actually see the base station
77549	which has some nice weight to it so it
79259	shouldn't move around unnecessarily if
81060	you don't want it to okay taking out
85650	that piece Razer is always so good at
87479	packaging so what we've brought in here
89579	is their usual three inches thick of
93240	documentation congratulations there's no
95520	turning back your a Razer owner now
97079	Razer Naga epic grid trainer these are
100680	good this is that here you go so little
103619	tabs that you can put on the MMO buttons
106049	on the side to help remember which is
108750	which so you can feel where the buttons
111570	are Quick Start Guide master guide OOP
114659	yes
115640	manual princi-pal so that would be
117869	another master guide product catalog and
119909	some Razer stickers next we find a box
124729	inside the box we find some foam
127489	actually inside the box we find a lot of
129598	good stuff so this is our cord
132700	just like the Mamba the Naga epic allows
136209	you through the use of this connector
138730	right here just like that
140129	to switch it into a courted Mouse should
143860	you so desire at any given time maybe
145750	your battery dies maybe you want it to
148620	charge while you're using it whatever
150910	the case may be you can switch to corded
153010	if you want at any time we also have a
155680	battery pack nice beefy looking thing
157660	I'm actually not quite sure how to
159040	install that but I'm not going to worry
160900	too much about it at this time
164560	yeah I'm really not going to worry too
166360	much about it at this time okay we also
168340	have the other two grips so according to
171400	razor
171849	there are the three grips there is one
174010	the palm grip which I guess is this one
178239	they're not actually labeled so that's a
180040	little challenging oh no they go this
181269	way okay so here we go so there's this
183940	so let's let's try it let's try and
185650	approximate which is which so I'm going
187090	to go ahead and say that this is
188349	probably the claw grip okay this has got
191410	to be the classic grip and the one that
193180	comes on it is the palm grip so the palm
195040	grip is a little bit wider okay so that
197709	means that you can cut it better with
199420	your hand we take that off and we put on
202420	the classic grip that's going to be the
204910	one that the regular Naga ships with so
207790	it's a little bit less you can't spread
211239	out your hand quite as much but still
213040	quite comfortable it's more of a three
215079	fingers on the mice and one one kind of
217359	dead space okay and then finally you've
220120	got the claw grip which goes on just
222730	like that okay and the claw grip is
224829	intended to be used with only these two
227139	fingers actuate abut ins your ring
229600	finger or your pinky finger gripping the
231280	mouse on this side and then your thumb
233440	gripping the mouse on this side
234549	personally I don't feel the Naga is best
236380	suited for claw grip because you need
238329	control of your thumb for these buttons
240010	so it's better to be holding on to the
242349	mouse over here oh sorry claw grip no no
244660	claw grip you do still have your palm on
246130	it forgot that's fingertip grip that I
247870	was thinking of so you can still control
249700	the buttons here you hold the mouse here
251739	here here you stabilize with your palm
253359	and you hold it also with your ring
255400	finger or pinky finger finally I did
257889	happen to find where the battery pack
261010	goes when I opened it up so you put it
263200	in there
263840	in this way a little eject button well I
266480	think that's the eject button just like
268940	that and you can take it out should you
271100	so desire so it is a user replaceable
272510	battery just like the regular Naga you
275090	have 12 yes 12 buttons on the side of
279080	the mouse which can be used to you know
281690	use potions or cast spells or whatever
284120	it is that you want to do okay you've
286070	also got your two standard mouse buttons
288020	your mouse wheel two more buttons here
290389	and on the bottom you can actually
292010	change the mode of these buttons on the
293389	side you can switch them to either bind
294979	to the number pad or to bind to the
297320	number keys at the top of the keyboard
298520	you can turn the mouse on and off it
300260	also has a pairing button which matches
302360	the pairing button on the base don't
304760	forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
307070	oh actually hold on note here's one more
308450	thing so you can also do this if you
310940	want to charge the mouse on the base
312139	station you plug this in here put it on
314000	the base station boom now it charges
315440	that way or you can plug it directly
317120	into the mouse you have both of those
318350	options don't forget to subscribe to
