0	this portion of our CES coverage is
1979	brought to you by LastPass check out the
3720	link in the video description to learn
5100	more and start securing your passwords
7020	today so we're here in the ZTE booth
9840	where we are checking out the normal
11670	ists Mart phone of all time it's got a
13500	1080p sixteen by nine resolution 5.2
16859	inch display it's got a quad-core
19140	Qualcomm processor four gigs of RAM it's
21869	got 64 gigs of storage it's got microSD
24689	expansion and oh wait what the actual
28380	crap just happened it opens up because
31529	it actually has a second screen so both
35340	of these are Gorilla Glass topped and
37469	when you combine them you get a whopping
39180	six point seven inch display and there
42540	are actually a number of different ways
44340	you can use it so either as one gigantic
48300	screen so go ahead and open up whoa
50340	there's the like the big news literally
53160	the big news you click this second home
56010	button down here you can change the mode
57690	to Mirror if say for example you had a
60739	James next to you and you were all like
62910	hi I'd like to read the same article as
65129	you at the same time after I closed this
67710	ad from Wired Thank You Wired thanks
69900	James so on the Left we've got our like
72150	normal home button so we could go ahead
73890	and be like oh I don't know my calendar
75479	and then over here we get an app drawer
77880	so we can say how about how about Chrome
80659	boom totally independent and for our
83850	last trick here you can just turn the
86400	second screen off to conserve battery
87810	it's got about a 3200 is a 31 eighty
91290	milliamp hour battery and as for the
93750	rest of the specs it's got bottom firing
95579	speakers USP type C a headphone jack
98490	it's got a single camera because the
100680	idea is that it's on this screen and you
102960	could like I don't know clone the
105119	screens and you can take pictures this
106500	way or you could not you could take
107700	pictures this way you don't really need
109079	a second camera the fingerprint sensor
111659	is actually on the side since organ
113939	amelie that's something that you'll be
115439	able to reach all the time with a device
117390	like this and speaking of which I
119520	actually really found that the
121619	ergonomics were not nearly as bad as I
124439	expected the
125720	has a like quite a satisfying click to
128840	it and when you're holding it in large
131090	screen mode which I really see
132470	realistically being the one that I would
134210	use the most it's actually got a bit of
136490	a lip at the back so you can hold it
138590	one-handed now with that said I do see
140420	the occasional spill being more likely
143630	with a phone like this than one that
145100	you're accustomed to holding the same
146660	wheel the timing for that zit te
148430	actually has a first-party case that
150140	they are providing for free once you
152150	activate it and I think you have to sign
153500	up or something like that you also get
154760	an extra two years of warranty on
156020	topical one so this case right here is
158300	just a little bit of kind of bumper
159560	protection around the outside it
160820	actually looks pretty sleek and doesn't
162890	add a ton of extra bulk to the phone
164720	either so right now it's exclusive to
166910	AT&amp;T in the US but when they launched
169700	worldwide and they are planning to
171260	launch in other countries it will be
173030	getting a availability where you are and
175340	be an upgrade to Android Oreo so its
177860	shipping with nougat right now so thanks

187970	of our business management and has been

192470	like this the last thing you need to be
194989	dealing with when you are in a hurry
196489	trying to produce 40-plus videos in a
198650	week is not having a login for an
201260	account and having to either go through
203180	the password reset rigmarole or call
205670	someone to try and get a password get
207170	them to text it to you that's totally
208370	insecure by the way unsecure not secure
211010	okay it's not insecure it's a different
212570	kind of non secure the point is LastPass
