0	this is a product I'm actually quite
1650	excited to have a look at this is the
3629	vision tech candy board it's a wireless
5580	mini keyboard with a built-in touchpad
8550	so one of the things that they're saying
10590	is so cool about this is that the fact
12599	that is the fact that the touchpad is
14750	capable of being used in both a
16770	horizontal or a vertical position and
18750	also that the quality of the touchpad is
21029	right up there with the ones that you'd
22320	find on a laptop versus some of the
24420	other kind of lame touchpad integrated
27960	keyboard units that just use a really
30269	low quality touchpad like it's basically
31650	as if it's not even really meant to be
33840	used it has a built-in laser pointer so
36480	I guess you could use it for pointing at
38250	stuff it has a USB connector with no
40110	drivers needed and it has a little
41910	compartment to store the USB dongle
43649	there is a USB input for charging the
46500	unit and it works with Windows ps3
48600	xbox360 Mac and Linux so basically
52140	everything you could want
53879	I lost my unboxing knife when I
56370	accidentally tried to take my keychain
58670	onto the plane with me when I went to
61020	mark him and not really thinking about
63719	it before taking my keys I left my knife
68070	on the keys and obviously that got
70380	confiscated by airport security funnily
73770	enough not until the return ride so the
75750	Vancouver Airport did not find the knife
78080	whereas the Toronto Airport did so
81570	that's the candy board it is tiny like I
83580	have small hands and already it's like
85409	you can see it's like got palm palm
87540	sized keyboard okay let's just have a
89880	look at what accessories are included if
91560	any and then we'll move on to there so
93390	we have a USB cable for charging the
95850	device then we have the user's manual
100290	turn off this device in the hospital
102810	attention to two tuna create this device
104939	while driving okay that's good these are
107880	good safety precautions as they're
109170	giving us here all right well here's a
110909	little map of the keyboard let's go
113399	ahead and take it out so it's got the
115470	little laser caution on it it's because
117540	it does have an included laser pointer
119399	so that's the first thing I want to try
121290	let's flip the switch to on and then try
124799	the laser pointer ah I'd have a laser
126930	pointer you okay so you can oh here here
130318	here's an idea
132160	what's that they love chasing the laser
139240	pointer that's rocket and here's Rumble
142380	okay anyway I digress the candy board
145660	then so here's the touchpad the touchpad
147850	is big enough to be comfortably used
149740	with the thumb and that's exactly the
151990	position that it's there for although
154570	with a finger you might get a little bit
156220	more range out of it because the thumb
157990	you see I can't actually move my thumb
159370	too much on it and let's have a look at
161410	the keyboard itself actually I didn't
163300	want to talk about the layout of it so
165400	here so here's the touchpad there's the
167560	laser pointer there's the direction keys
170440	okay so that's handy to have and then
173440	there's a left mouse button a right
175240	mouse button so in case you want to
177100	operate the touchpad like this that
178840	would work quite well for you so I guess
181030	the touchpad can also be used this way
182830	although I don't know if there's a
184510	toggle for that or if it just knows
187020	which way it's being used okay so
190390	function keys
192540	okay function and alt is oh there's your
194890	start key so if you hold function and
196690	press that one that's your start key
197890	here's your Windows key like what oh no
200950	this is the ninety degree flip aha
202390	there's the start key the windows key
203860	okay so that's how you flip the touchpad
205690	to operate it this way okay that's cool
209160	power switch here's your RF
211090	communication indicator as well as your
212590	battery indicator and there's your shift
215740	or function not sure which one it is
217570	indicator so you have a caps lock key
219940	tab escape shift you've got basically a
221709	full keyboard on here see how easily you
223900	can actually type on it so if I want to
225610	go to WWN CI XCOM I mean that's really
231400	what this is for is just like entering a
233620	web address for your media PC like
235540	you're not gonna use it a ton but I'd
238870	say that you know it's tough because
242040	this thumb very comfortably reaches all
245410	of the left-hand keys whereas this thumb
247810	because of my smaller hands actually
250090	only probably reaches comfortably to
251860	about the K or even just the L so if it
254500	was shorter you might be able to reach
256298	them all but then you'd be compromising
258190	because you wouldn't have the
259488	touchpad anymore so the device is quite
261769	thin let's have a look at where the USB
263569	key wireless receiver is stored it's
266569	quite large actually unexpectedly large
269060	but it's not Bluetooth I don't know if
272660	that matters it's a 2.4 gigahertz
274310	wireless dongle there it is put that
278120	back in and then other than that I guess
280430	there's not too much else to say
282020	there is the candy board from vision
284090	tech one of the other cool things about
285830	it is it's quite a lot cheaper than most
287270	of the other touchpad keyboard combo
290030	units and it really does at the size of
291949	a remote because that's really the size
293419	that we're looking at here at the size
295280	of a remote it has great functionality
297139	and the price is pretty reasonable so
298759	I'd say it's pretty cool pretty cool
301039	indeed see if we can find a CAD Hey Hey
308979	and that laser pointer is a great little
311840	feature
