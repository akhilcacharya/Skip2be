0	thanks to math drop for sponsoring this
1800	video here at CES 2018 check out the JBL
4440	LS r 30x powered speakers available now
7109	for a hundred bucks below launch price
8910	at the link below this is the Lenovo
11580	IdeaPad 720s now normally when I walk
15389	into a booth and I go oh it's a thin in
17369	light I go well that one is definitely
20390	running in shell but for the first time
26210	ever I'm looking at an all AMD solution
30269	and something that I would legitimately
32279	call a thin and light notebook so it's
36390	got pretty much everything you would
38309	expect you got a couple of USB sees a
40770	USB 3 type-a more USB 3 type-a and
43860	something I don't necessarily expect
45510	anymore it's got a headphone jack it's
47430	got a 1080p display it's matte it
49710	appears to be IPS but not like the
52800	world's most exceptional IPS or anything
54660	like that
55500	it's got actually pretty decent feeling
57719	keyboard trackpad and rise in 7 inside
62100	so it's actually running a quad-core 8
64860	thread processor and not only that but
67860	it's running Vega graphics - so what's
70860	in here is a vague at 10 now that's not
73560	to say that the quad-core risin 7 with
77159	Vega 10 in here is going to necessarily
79400	outperform the quad-core Verizon 5 with
83310	Vega 8 graphics over here because AMD is
86189	making these CPUs highly configurable so
89549	this one is set to around 15 watts which
92159	means that while you will enjoy a 2.2
94380	gigahertz base you might not be able to
96600	reach the 3.8 gigahertz Boost all the
99000	time and unfortunately at this time we
101579	can't tell you anything about how the
103890	Vega graphics are gonna perform because
105810	we were not allowed to install games on
108930	it what we do know though is that AMD is
111360	saying that we can expect performance up
113670	to twice Intel integrated graphics is
116820	funny the lighting turned blue right as
118320	I said that for the rest of the specs
119969	this guys running eight gigs of 24
121799	hundred megahertz ddr4 it's got a 256
124560	gig SSD and I believe it is actually
127049	going on sale in some parts of the world
129030	either right now or very very shortly
133000	oh man if I am AMD and their partners I
136930	am super stoked to have a solution that
139570	can legitimately compete in this space
141490	because for basically forever the
144580	Ultrabook has been so dominated by Intel
148330	that they even got to invent the name
150160	for the category which I can't call this
153790	an ultrabook because it's not because
154959	that's like TM it's just really thin and
157720	light so back to mass drop then the LS
160480	are 30x speakers are designed to deliver
162190	strong base smooth highs and evenness
164560	throughout the frequency response with
166420	some pretty cool features so you can use
168190	the low and high frequency trim switches
170500	to fine tune the amount of bass and
172300	treble to compensate for the room you're
174010	in and they feature XLR and TRS inputs
176680	so you can connect your speakers to many
178720	different sources you can check them out
180340	at the link to mass drop in the video
182320	description so thanks for watching guys
184810	if you disliked this video then you
187120	clearly don't like having options as a
189340	consumer because this is a very
192190	important step but if you liked it hit
194140	like get subscribed and make sure you
196120	don't miss any of the rest of our CES
