60	it's 2016 and wireless controllers have
2580	been a thing for a long time on tonsils
4529	I use a wireless Xbox controller for a
7140	bunch of games but what about mice why
10440	aren't we all using wireless mice for
12420	gaming on PC I could just say it's
15780	because between TV input lag and
18210	cinematic frame rates console players
20670	can't tell the difference anyway but
23279	while that's actually part of the answer
25680	the rest of it is actually less
27900	offensive to console gamers and possibly
30779	more interesting stay tuned
42650	be quiet silent wings three use a
45570	smooth-running six pull order to remain
47910	silent and better cool your PC check
50550	them out at the link below
52290	back to our original question for a
54090	moment if manufacturers have been
56190	pushing wireless technology down our
58020	throats for over 10 years now
60510	why haven't cordless mice ever really
62910	taken off outside of the office one
65489	since they're Wireless they're gonna
67620	need batteries and that means they can't
69630	be all that light a couple of popular
72390	gaming mice among competitive gamers
74400	like the final Mouse the Logitech G pro
77240	they're like seventy and eighty four
79800	grams respectively but the G 900 and G
82500	403 Wireless are both 107 grams that's
85680	20% heavier than the G 403 wired version
88700	with that said the bodies of other
91110	respectable gaming mice like the Razer
93270	DeathAdder and SteelSeries rival are
95460	actually about the same so wireless mice
98540	aren't in a different weight class
100979	altogether except for the Mamba that is
104729	a whale at 125 grams 2 batteries don't
109830	just add weight they also add
112730	inconvenience like wired mice never need
116340	to be charged and while office grade
118170	wireless mice can last months on a pair
120720	of disposable batteries wireless gaming
123330	mice because of their higher performance
125520	hardware and higher polling rates need
127800	to be charged several times a week
129889	that's kind of inconvenient I I never do
133650	it though some of them have handy docks
136320	which is a bit more convenient than
138060	plugging in a USB connector but it's it
141420	takes up valuable desk space that I can
143549	populate with action figures or Pop
146100	Tarts and on the subject of valuable
149250	three wireless mice are much more
152880	expensive like while you can get good
156150	wired gaming mice for like 20 to 30
158400	dollars if you don't get fancy things
161160	like RGB lighting the g4 o3 wireless
164430	sits at $99 with higher-end models like
167700	the G 900 and razer mamba they're gonna
170670	cost you around 150 bucks
175160	and what do you get for your money a
177680	better gaming experience Johnno
181670	what you get is problem number four more
185240	input lag at least that used to be the
189530	case like okay so far it sounds like
193040	this entire video is going to be one
195080	long hate session on wireless mice
196940	because I'm somes kind of pretentious
200180	Gaming Mouse purist but I've actually
202910	been using the G 403 Wireless and this
205670	was not an easy decision but unlike my
208640	previous attempts to go wireless like
210320	with the Razer Ouroboros this time I am
213290	NOT going back so let's talk about why
216010	while I don't have the scientific
218990	apparatus to validate their claims
220850	Logitech says their Wireless performance
223130	is on par or better than wired mice and
226780	does this look like a face that would
229370	lie to you no but really I haven't seen
232760	or felt anything to make me doubt that I
234830	don't know this a delay in movement or
236930	clicks and I haven't had it disconnect
239390	wired mice I'll actually have this to
241820	connect because I'll accidentally pull
243260	out the cable and this thing this this
245750	works even in my apartment with like
248240	signals bouncing around everywhere from
250160	neighbors and outside of like a crowded
252740	LAN party that's probably the worst case
255440	scenario for wireless products in
256910	general so with no performance issues
259760	not having to deal with a cable after so
262400	many years of using a mouse bungee or
264320	we're taping it to my desk or wrapping
267230	it around the lamp
268250	it's just awesome I love lightweight
272510	mice but I feel like trading some weight
275630	for a more full range of motion to make
277580	flick shots without knocking over it's
281690	finally worth it and while this doesn't
284780	solve all of my wireless complaints like
287540	I forget to charge my mouse constantly
290210	because I'm a bit of a scatterbrain I
292510	haven't had it died on me yet because a
295040	full charge lasts about twenty-five
297080	hours of constant use and I can't play
300580	constantly for twenty-five hours and
302720	when it gets low it tells you to plug in
304910	I just forget but it still works
308230	okay but I don't expect you to take my
310330	word for it entirely like I'm I'm not a
312940	filthy casual like Linus or whatever but
317170	there's a reason why people including
319750	myself look to the pros and wonder what
322690	are they using to win tournaments and
325320	you know who just want to turn them in
327850	using the g43 Wireless cloud nines
330820	automatic
331870	they beat SK in the ESL pro league
333910	finals and he was if you ignore the
336970	salty salty Brazilian SK fans he was the
340240	real MVP of the tournament new Mouse big
343120	victory coincidence maybe but I think
348400	the only reasonable conclusion is that
350500	Wireless is the future okay so when all
354070	that said not all Wireless is created
356470	equal so for the time being the answer
360280	is a bit more complicated you may have
362950	noticed that this video started out as
365140	Wired vs. Wireless and ended up mostly
367960	being about Blodgett XP 403 and G 900
371470	the reason for that is that I just can't
374800	recommend the other solutions the G 900s
378760	price might be off-putting and you might
381100	not like the ambidextrous shape and
382900	design the g4 3 Wireless is a cheaper
386080	more mainstream option but it still
389140	comes at a price and weight premium over
391630	the wired version I still think they're
393910	worth it but some people don't two
396730	options can't really kill off Wired
398440	gaming mice but they're proof that the
400780	technology is here and it's ready are
