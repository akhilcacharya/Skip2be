0	a data XP gv2 memory kits are optimized
8670	for the latest Intel gaming platforms
10440	check the link in the video description
11550	for more details I don't even know what
14190	Gandy's means to me it sounds kind of
16560	like it adjective like Oman that was so
18840	Gandhi as oh yeah or something anyway
22020	this is the Zeus from Gambia this is the
24330	eSports Edition it is a laser gaming
26340	mouse that is capable of 8200 dpi just
31650	like most of the other gaming mice these
33420	days so that particular feature doesn't
35370	set it apart but I'm hoping that what
37680	we'll find when we open up this mouse
39510	right here is other things to set it
42030	apart like those little things that they
43680	thought of that someone else didn't like
46020	we saw with their keyboard not that long
48809	ago where it's kind of like oh okay
51390	there is still innovation in the gaming
54390	peripheral scene and there is still room
56340	for improvements to be made so let's
58890	start with what's inside they've got
60239	reasonably nice packaging here so the
62129	you know cable sits in there and the
63660	other stuff sits somewhere else they've
65369	got the mouse itself inside as well as
68479	documentation that talks about the gam
71070	DS Olympics or something so has
73470	harnessed to Zeus's most powerful weapon
75930	into something but anyway ok next we've
79170	got it looks like a cleaning cloth or
82350	whatever this is what is this accessory
86640	storage pouch ok so the weight tuning
89579	piece right here which you can adjust
91680	sort of where the weights it can go
93509	inside the accessory pouch as well as
96329	extra Teflon feet ok
99450	and some Gambia stickers which you could
102810	apply to your things if you so desired
105270	more Teflon feet and finally an
107820	instruction manual and this is kind of
109740	unique so most of the main points about
111360	the mouse are actually inside here so it
113520	supports up to a 1000 Hertz polling rate
116909	which is pretty standard it has a 32-bit
118979	cortex microprocessor inside it so guys
121979	just to put that in perspective you
123899	might think oh well it's a mouse I mean
125790	what kind of processing power doesn't
127049	need and you'd kind of be right but
128758	there are things that a mouse will need
130889	to do so for example if you're running a
132630	flex extremely long macro it might be
134850	beneficial have a better processor if
136410	you are trying to track over a
138930	particularly difficult surface a better
141510	processor might benefit your mouse and
143400	so that just little things like that but
145800	I mean it's still probably a little bit
148050	overkill to be completely realistic
149490	about it so let's get into the mouse
152850	itself so the first thing you'll notice
155610	about the mouse is it actually has quite
157320	tasteful lighting effects you can cycle
159180	through profiles and you can actually
160500	see which profile you're on visibly with
163170	an LED indicator under the mouse wheel
165420	up here there you go we've got some Reds
167550	more inge some blues and lots of
169740	different color so you can configure
170970	those within the HERA software which is
173340	I mean this is like this is like the
175140	funniest thing I think I've seen on a
176700	product in a little while here so check
178200	this out guys so one of the buttons on
180000	the mouse is configured this one right
181530	here to launch the downloader page so
184560	check this out click basically it's a
186900	macro that goes start run and types and
189780	get nice calm I love it so because the
192000	mouse has onboard memory it has 512 K
194400	onboard memory you can actually set up
196830	things the way you like it and then you
198540	can just use them that way on any
200580	computer so they've of course done this
202080	at the factory so that it's set up that
203880	way it's got nine programmable buttons
206100	so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 middle-click 9 and
210450	then the left and right buttons
212400	themselves and that pretty much does it
215250	for the top it has a nice soft touch
216780	field that isn't sort of too soft it
219270	still has a tiny bit of texture but it's
221550	a little bit slippery as well which i
224040	think is going to be good for durability
225540	in the long term unlike something like
227310	the logitech g9 which i have an old old
229530	g9 and it basically just peeled away and
231450	logitech's basically come out and said
232920	all of our new mice yeah they don't peel
234270	anymore so anyway this doesn't look like
236130	it's going to have any peeling issues
237510	and now we can move on to the bottom
239250	where we see more lighting effects these
241230	ones look really really cool so it's
243660	like a red under glow looks outstanding
245670	speaking of things that look outstanding
247260	check this out so these right here are
249390	some of the finest organ homage US teen
253740	on a product at all so you can actually
256649	adjust the width of the mouse in three
259858	different places here here so this piece
263700	right here you can actually see there
264960	are gaps in the mouse
266080	okay so here as well as here can be
269319	adjusted either in or out with three
271900	separate wheels on the bottom of the
273340	mouse and I can tell you guys that it is
275259	very dramatic the difference between the
278139	mouse fully sort of clamped together and
280960	fully extended so good on Gambia's for
284409	coming up with yet another innovative
286090	sort of implementation of something that
288729	is an idea that's been done before the
290889	whole adjustable ergonomics speaking of
293020	adjustable things you can pop out the
294460	back here just like that and it flips
296530	out five little weight compartments so
298539	there's a little thing right here so you
299710	can start taking them out but I didn't
301090	have too much trouble taking it out
302710	anyway just kind of pull up on them like
304900	that so they're four and a half gram
306219	weights each you go little four and a
308500	half gram thing right there and you can
310330	adjust them however you want the overall
311949	finish to the mouse is very very nice I
314560	mean there's just little little touches
316330	like the braided cable I do appreciate
317830	braided cables just because they're a
320229	little bit more cat proof a little like
321879	shiny Gambia's logo here on the top so
324430	with all that said what do you get for
325930	this Mouse you get something that's very
327550	adjustable I want to give you guys sort
329319	of a quick look at the ergonomics I'd
331090	say for anyone with medium sized hands
332979	this is going to be quite a comfortable
334599	Paul Mouse because you can see my hands
336639	are a little bit on the small side so
337900	I'm going to have trouble reaching that
339009	last button right there but the other
340690	three I can roll my thumb along no
342669	problem no difficulty there these can
344919	all be easily reached but if you have
346750	medium-sized hands this is going to be a
348219	really nice paul mouse and if you were
349839	to widen it fully and you had quite
352060	large hands you could probably claw it a
353620	little bit as well it should be noted
355360	that in spite of the adjustability here
356830	these are quite strong so there's not
359080	much flex to them even I believe it's
362199	this one right here the bottom one that
363940	is fully extended I can go ahead and I
365889	can squeeze that pretty hard and you're
368620	really not going to see you're not going
370599	to see any give to it so good on them
372190	for getting that right on their first
373659	attempt as well that combined with the
375639	fact that it has a full set of
376779	replaceable feet is pretty nice to see
379719	too so thank you for checking out my
