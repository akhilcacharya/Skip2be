0	this video is brought to you by our
1770	trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
5460	to my unboxing and first look at the
7440	Corsair Vengeance M 65 it uses the same
10590	overall shell as the m60 which they
13349	released quite a while ago as one of
15450	their first forays into the peripheral
18210	world so the m60 and the M 90 were
20760	Corsairs first gaming mice and they've
22890	basically taken what was already good
24810	about the existing models and improved
27029	on them in a couple of subtle ways so
29010	well actually the first way they've
30599	improved on really isn't that subtle at
32130	all and it's now available in three
34110	colors as opposed to one so we've
35610	actually got all three of them here
36750	today the one I'll be unboxing is a
38160	military green whereas it's also
40110	available in the traditional black as
41760	well as kind of like a sweet
43610	stormtrooper white and it looks like
45360	what Corsair is going for here is no
47489	matter what Corsair case you have you
49829	can pretty much get yourself a vengeance
51739	m65 to match it Packaging is pretty
54629	straightforward so it's just got a
56010	plastic shell within a cardboard
58109	exterior there you go it's just a molded
60660	shaped thing pull out the mouse and
62430	that's pretty much all it's included in
64110	here so there's a little bit of
65339	documentation that's going to tell you
67380	about your two-year warranty as well as
70500	how to go to Corsair comm and download
74070	the latest drivers which is like yay
75780	don't bother including a disc what's the
77610	point and let's have a look at the mouse
80880	itself so I'm probably gonna get slick
83369	to come and join you here in a minute no
84840	not yet not yet sorry I'm just giving
86700	you prior warning I know usually I say
88500	that and I mean like immediately yeah
90329	okay so we've got a braided cable that
92640	terminates in a USB so there you go it's
95159	labeled so you know it's a mouse you
96990	know it's corsair assuming you can see
98520	both sides of it at the same time nice
100290	high-quality braiding so you can't see
101939	any of the cords through there it's a
105420	boat and it's about an entire Lynas
108600	wingspan in length so that's practically
111420	it's probably a 6 foot cord based on how
113549	how long that is compared to my arms and
116219	let's have a look at the ergonomics if
118229	you haven't already seen an m60 then
120570	this will be new if not considered a
123090	refresher so down here we've got three
125280	adjustable weight zones so you can
126719	customize not only the overall weight of
129209	the mouse but you can actually customize
131129	also the way
133800	distribution of the mouse so I'm going
135360	to run and grab a screwdriver here I'm
136800	just going to go across one of the
138960	cameras with a crotch shot hopefully
140460	they don't switch to that one well we're
142170	in the editing process so inside each of
145560	these ones you can decide okay I want it
147330	more heavy at the back or I want it more
149430	heavy at the front so each of them has a
151710	little weight inside of it that you can
153510	either remove or keep in there all right
157050	we've also got poly tetra fluoro
161010	ethylene I think is what the actual name
163530	for it is but Teflon slippy pads all
166110	over the bottom of the mouse I love
167520	seeing nice big slippy pads I don't
170670	think anyone but me calls them slippy
172020	pads but whatever because they it just
174360	means they're going to be less likely to
176070	wear out over time it doesn't actually
177390	affect how slippery the mouse is on your
180270	mousing surface it just affects how long
182310	it takes for them to wear out so there's
183630	actually five of those on the bottom as
185070	well as check this out so there's a
186870	solid aluminum house in embody two the
190590	mouse that makes it extremely rigid in
192540	the hand and actually also contributes a
194430	little bit of weight to it as well
195750	another big improvement they've made
197340	over the m60 is that the laser has been
199770	replaced with an Avago a DNS 9800 sensor
203610	so that's capable of up to 8200 dpi
205890	which let's face it guys is only really
208770	going to be useful for you if you're
210989	running like a surround monitor setup or
213150	very high resolution monitor because
214980	other than that you're probably going to
216900	turn that sensor down and yeah you
221160	probably won't use it to it to its full
222870	potential but it does have other cool
224160	features as well so you can adjust
225660	things like your lift distance you can
227580	adjust angle snapping you can do surface
230430	testing with it it actually can can
233430	adapt to different surfaces quite easily
235980	so I mean yeah there's still advantages
237930	to having a high-end laser it's not
239370	necessarily all about dpi it just
241739	happens that a high-end laser tends to
244020	have high DPI because people want more
247320	better numbers and all that good stuff
249360	so now let's get into the actual
250680	ergonomics of it it is pretty much an
253500	optimal shape for someone with smaller
255959	to mid-size hands to palm grip however I
258779	think someone with larger hands who I'm
260459	going to have just kind of leaned over
262019	here and there you go thanks slick we'd
264180	probably be more comfortable with a claw
265950	grip on a mouse like this
267600	whereas a palm grip is going to be a bit
269460	of a challenge for him because he's got
271770	baseball mid sized ham so this gives you
273480	some perspective of everything from
275400	petit hands to large ones you've got
277410	back and forward buttons in there I
279030	would consider optimal locations a
281070	little bit offset from where your thumb
283110	would normally actually rest on this lip
285450	right here but still within easy
287550	reaching distance and you're not going
289410	to lose control of the mouse or be
290760	unable to lift it if you want to
292770	activate those buttons if anything if I
295110	had to complain about something with
296400	respect to the positioning of the
297510	buttons here its with my small hands if
299190	I'm not claw gripping I might have a
301200	little bit of trouble reaching the aim
302700	button here which is a dpi changer so if
306930	you're zooming in to snipe or whatever
308820	else you want to adjust your DPI on the
310290	fly you just press that button and
312000	you're ready to go so moving up to the
314100	top of the mouse we've got our dpi
316020	adjustment buttons as well as indicator
317880	LEDs and a solid metal scroll wheel that
319890	actually feels quite nice it has a fair
322410	bit of heft to it so the Corsairs also
325440	updated their software they've got a
326700	second generation control panel that
328350	they've added now the early software for
330780	the m60 and the m9 D was not very strong
332880	but it's actually improved a lot over
334920	the last little while so if you have an
336960	m60 or an m9 t that you've shelved it
339420	might be time to bring it back out and
340860	give it another crack because the
342660	overall build quality of the mouse is
344160	solid and as long as the software is up
346260	to snuff then it does give a very good
347610	gaming experience so thank you for
349500	checking out my unboxing on first look
351360	at the Vengeance m65 from Corsair don't
