10230	for more details welcome to my unboxing
12750	and first look at the G 700 s from
15509	Logitech the key difference between
17760	their 7 Series mice so the G 7 the G 700
21480	and now the G 700 S is the fact that
24210	they are all wireless but gaming grade
26789	the G seven was really the first Mouse
29130	that was marketed as a gaming grade
30990	wireless mouse and the difference
32399	between gaming capable wireless mice and
35340	non gaming capable ones is all about the
37680	latency so creating a wireless
39960	connection that is low latency enough
42329	the gamers aren't going to notice any
44340	input lag from the mouse is key to being
48329	able to well being able to be responsive
50610	enough particularly for FPS gamers in
53340	order to really with a straight face
54660	call it gaming grade now Logitech has
57870	recently upgraded a few well pretty much
60660	their entire G series of products with
63420	this S suffix at the end of it so the S
66659	is for I don't know for supreme
70290	performance of surface or something like
73020	that and what they've really done is
74130	they've upgraded the materials that
75630	they're using on the products themselves
77630	covering them in a hydrophobic coating
80119	upgrading things like the grippy sides
82700	upgrading everything about them to make
84750	them last longer and feel better on the
87119	user's hands so they shouldn't get all
89100	sort of greasy and sweaty and nasty and
91500	they should be easier to grip and I
93030	shouldn't peel back in fact my only
95100	complaint about one of my favorite my
97140	sever the G 9 was the fact that my grip
99450	peeled other than that it was
101150	near-perfect
102509	so let's see what else Logitech has to
104220	say for themselves about this 200 all
106530	the way up to 8200 dpi giving you the
108630	ultimate in flexibility so that's 12
111329	mega pixels per second and image
112799	processing and the maximum speed of up
114990	to 4 meters per second so 4 contacts
118590	that's tested on popular gaming mousepad
120390	surfaces so for context guys I'd be like
122689	if I was moving my mouse this fast like
126390	probably faster like no one actually
128008	well ok maybe someone actually moves
130169	like that over a very short distance but
132000	should be able to handle it let's go
134340	back up back to the box over here
136130	sixteen bits per axis up to a thousand
138900	reports per second that's great for a
140460	wireless mouse there's only a few that
141960	are capable of that and durability of 20
144180	million clicks for the buttons and 250
146190	kilometers for the feet although
147750	unfortunately they don't say what
149670	surface that is on so apparently the
152100	buttons are fingerprint-resistant it's
154410	where you can recharge and handle data
156660	over single connection it has five
158280	onboard memory profiles which you can
159750	switch between with this button 13
161520	programmable buttons and you can adjust
163290	your DPI on-the-fly now one of the
166350	coolest Logitech features that they
168780	really introduced so here let's go
170430	through what's in here but I'll talk
172680	about the scroll wheel in a minute so
174150	you've got an extension cord for the
175560	wireless receiver and it does not use
177660	the same unified wireless receiver that
180239	their other products are capable of
181860	connecting to this is a special one and
183709	it is just for your gaming mouse because
186900	the data rates required are higher than
189270	on their consumer grade products so
191340	there you go this extension cable is
192900	about I don't know but a little less
195959	than a Linus arm spin so it must be
197640	around 5 feet long and then you can run
200100	that to somewhere where you're going to
201150	have good reception there are flat
202590	bottom pieces here so you can stick it
204390	to something to do whatever else you
205320	want with it we've also got a cable that
207390	can be used to charge the mouse or run
210000	in Wired mode so this one right here is
212640	not braided or anything like that in
214200	fact out of all the mice I've seen so
216150	far from their new GS series the G 500s
219810	is the only one that's had a braided
221010	cable it doesn't really affect
222570	performance but it's one of those
224190	premium feeling things that I wouldn't
226110	have minded seeing if they could include
228150	it so you can see how it plugs in right
229530	here so you can plug it in to charge
231320	unplug it to not charge and it'll look
233640	just like a wired mouse when you are not
235500	operating it in that fashion let's have
237930	a look at what else they've got included
239310	here looks like a set up guide plug the
241680	thing into the thing and all likely had
243090	warranty information it does have a
244500	three year warranty it should be noted
246480	that Logitech's warranty is absolutely
248340	legendary and I've personally
249470	experienced it in the past many times
252030	they don't even require you to ship the
253380	product back to them at all so here's
255450	the battery oh I'd love to see that if
257548	you guys have been watching my videos
258660	for any kind of period of time you'll
260760	know I love sanyo eneloop so I guess
263780	their planet Panasonic whatever well
265670	this one still has the Sanyo branding on
267080	it I love any loops they're the best
269440	rechargeable batteries they're awesome
271580	and the cool thing about enna loops is
273500	it means your G 700s is going to arrive
275690	ready to play you don't have to charge
277310	it before you use it because they hold a
279260	charge incredibly well there's an on/off
281600	switch at the bottom so you can turn it
283010	off when you're in transit and they have
284810	enormous non-slip enormous slippy pads
288590	on the bottom of the mouse this doesn't
290720	affect how much friction the mouse has
292610	with the surface below it because it's
293990	not how friction works but what it does
295820	do is it effectively makes the mouse
297620	more durable because there's little hair
299870	there there's more surface to rub off
301880	over time so that's I guess how they're
304220	getting that 250 kilometer durability on
307220	the mouse itself so let's go ahead and
309500	let's get this get this mouse going over
312560	here so we've got a right-handed shape
314600	which we've come to expect from logitech
317390	gaming mice they don't have a
318740	left-handed Mouse I kind of wish they do
320570	one and I know that many left-handed
322190	gamers do but it's a very ergonomic
325070	shape now you can see here this is
326750	designed for palm the shape here it fits
329060	right into your palm and you can quite
331310	comfortably especially if you have
332540	slightly larger hands than me I have
333890	quite small hands so you can see there's
335780	a fair bit of space left at the end of
337310	the buttons and my index finger sits in
340880	such a way that I'm kind of between
342260	these two so if you had medium sized
344780	hands you'd sit right here where you can
347210	very easily press this one this one or
349340	this one so those are the g8g 9 and g10
351800	buttons these are fully programmable
353180	buttons and your hand would also sit a
356870	little bit more forward on the mouse and
358070	you know be a little bit more
359750	comfortable so I wouldn't necessarily
360710	recommend this for people with super
363020	small hands like I have on the side of
365150	the most you've got four more G buttons
367130	as well as the battery indicator at a
368960	very very nice coating finish here we've
371390	seen this already on some of the other
372830	GS series mice and it's equally
375470	impressive here however I haven't used
377660	them for long enough to get my hands
379130	sweaty to the point where I've observed
381169	the difference in the hydrophobic
382789	coating now back to the scroll wheel
384440	this is such an awesome Logitech feature
386720	I I love it
388729	so normally it's a clicky scroll wheel
390530	here I'm going to hold it up to a mic up
392090	here so you guys guys can hear
395180	but that clique can you hear that all
397130	right awesome now check this out by
399230	pressing this gear button this
400700	disengaged button here free spin so if
405260	you don't use your mouse only for gaming
407390	and you also use it for work or maybe
408950	you want to bind something to like a
410420	bajillion scroll wheel flick so you can
412760	just flick the mouse you can browse
414260	through excel sheets web pages whatever
416120	else very very quickly you just go flick
418310	stop when you see the thing you want to
419990	see and it's absolutely awesome
421940	I believe this button right yep this
423620	button right here is cycling through the
425060	DPI profiles so we got one two three
427580	four five different dpi profiles just by
431030	clicking on that button up at the top
432380	but you can rebind the g buttons to
435200	whatever you want so the total number of
437060	buttons is count them up with me one two
439910	three one on the click right there by
443300	sort accounts because it only does this
445100	so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 buttons let's
450470	see if that's what they say on the box
452030	because maybe I missed one but you know
454400	what they don't seem to say it all so
456980	thank you for checking out my own may
459110	say 13 what will be back I figured it
462410	out this mouse balls so hard it has a
464060	tilting scroll wheel forgot about that
465800	so 4 on the side which I can reach
467540	easily even with my smaller hands 3 over
470660	here on the left which I can reach 2 of
472490	easily and there's a third one that I
473840	could reach but it'd be a little bit
474980	tough so at 7 total 8 9 10 11 12 13
479890	thank you for checking out my unboxing
482030	and first look at the G 700 s from
484190	Logitech don't forget to subscribe for
