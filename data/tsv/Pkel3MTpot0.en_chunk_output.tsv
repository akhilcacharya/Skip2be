30	freshbooks is the number one cloud
1890	accounting software custom-built for the
3629	way that you want to work for your
5130	unrestricted free 30-day trial go to
7859	FreshBooks comm slash line of CES and
10200	speaking of custom-built for the way you
12420	want to work we're back at Silverstone
14099	checking out the top five crazy things
16440	that we found at their booth that are
17430	actually really useful and we're gonna
19230	start off with the MSO nine and the MSO
21570	nine mini these are MDOT 2 SATA
24630	enclosures but not just that they also
27060	have a USB 3.1 type-a connector on the
29550	edge so to make it yourself you just
31289	remove the four screws on the back
32790	that's on the side with the switch on it
34530	for your USB type a connector open it up
37140	flip it over and then inside the
38850	standard MSO nine you can fit at 22:40
41820	to a twenty two sixty or a 20 to 80
44370	sized MDOT to SATA drive and in the
47370	smaller MSO nine mini you can fit a
49770	twenty to forty two then just close it
51899	back up and you have your own awesome
53219	super fast ten gigabit per second flash
55920	drive that you can then convert later on
57960	to be a system drive or whatever else
59789	you want moving on we've got probably my
61920	favorite thing here and it's the third
63750	time that's been released and it's still
65129	probably my favorite thing here just
66299	because it's so kind of hilariously
68280	awesome and that's their remote starter
70500	kit for your PC this time it has a
72420	speaker mounted to it so when you press
74280	the power button or reset button from
76049	across the room you have to hear that
77759	your computer turned on it doesn't seem
79470	like immediately you might need that
81180	functionality but when you can't see the
82680	computer necessarily it's actually
84299	pretty freaking cool when you plug it
85920	into your motherboard for the power
87540	switch and reset switch headers it also
89880	has break offs I don't know an Escalade
92670	what to call them pass throughs that you
94259	can plug your standard power button and
96119	reset button on your case into so don't
98040	lose any of that functionality either I
99810	think this is actually pretty damn cool
101610	and it plugs in through the PCIe 1x slot
103799	on your motherboard next up we've just
106140	got an expansion card that you can mount
108030	an nvme m2 SSD into which is really cool
112320	because it's so small if you notice
114630	there's no even mounting bracket to go
116460	on the outside of the case it's also
117899	really short if you have a tiny little
120000	builds that you need to make and you do
122189	have an available 16x slot you can drop
125219	this in here get another drive don't
126810	have to worry about clearance on top of
128220	it and don't have to worry about
129300	mounting it on the back pretty cool then
131730	we have there tpo 2 m2
133590	link it for MDOT two SSDs I know a lot
135390	of this stuff as MDOT to based this I'm
137400	mainly calling out just because it's
138690	kind of funny they added an actual
140640	physical heat sink into the box because
142500	people were too sketched out with their
144270	previous version that actually worked
145950	better but don't worry that's all
148200	previous stuff is still included in here
149730	if you've been following the news on
151590	MDOT - cooling stuff these heat sinks
153720	that go on the top of them don't
155700	accomplish a ton but people love them
157680	because they look like they'll
158819	accomplish a ton it still has the
160709	thermal pad which can thermally conduct
162989	from the MDOT 2 drives controller mainly
165630	down into a mainboard or whatever it's
167519	actually mounted on which is actually
168959	far more effective so you've got the
170790	peace of mind over the piece of metal
172170	that goes on top and you've got the
173459	effectiveness of a thermal pad that goes
175140	on the bottom and then just in case your
177150	love for em to just absolutely cannot be
179519	satiated we have another way to mount
182730	them all the way from 20 to 40 to 220 to
185220	110 those really long m2 drives this
188610	will convert them to SATA so you can
191130	have 4 SATA plugs only takes one SATA
193410	power which is actually pretty cool as
194819	well and you can have way more m2 in
196860	your system just in case you've
198329	populated all the m2 on your board and
200670	you've populated all the PCIe lanes you
203609	can possibly plug m2 into you've done
205829	everything else and you still want more
207299	drives you can have four of them mounted
209340	into a three and a half inch drive bay
210780	and speaking of MDOT - and other things
212459	that we just can't get enough of sponsor
214650	spots thank you - fresh books for
216120	sponsoring this video you can use
217620	they're easy tools to create invoices in
220290	less than 30 seconds you can even view
222480	if people have seen your invoices or not
224430	so you can check in with them and make
225840	sure that they're actually going to pay
227069	you which is a pretty important process
228720	of running a business you can focus on
230970	things like doing your job and pushing
233190	forward in your company instead of just
234690	doing paperwork which can be frustrating
236370	and annoying and speaking of less
238109	paperwork you can also accept credit
239549	cards through their online platform
241109	which is helpful as well if you want to
242880	check it out for your free unrestricted
