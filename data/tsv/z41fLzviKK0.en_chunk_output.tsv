960	[Music]
6410	well you guys asked for it and this is
8910	the big brother to the k60 the coarser
13139	vengeance k9t keyboard now I made a
16139	mistake I would say a fairly fairly
19350	large mistake when I was doing my
21510	unboxing of the k60 and I said at the
25199	time although I corrected it by the end
27150	of the video I said at the time that I
30240	thought the k60 had blue backlighting I
33930	was wrong because I thought both the k60
37680	in the k9t had blue backlighting and my
40350	only experience with these keyboards at
42840	all up to that time had been with the
45750	k9t so now when I talk about the wicked
49110	awesome individually backlit keys I
53399	would be correct because the k9t is a
56969	gorgeous looking keyboard in the dark
59910	with it's beautifully individually
63030	backlit keys so something else to bear
66240	in mind about the backlight is that it
67860	does shine through these laser etched
69570	numbers which are not printed that's
72960	right they are etched so that means that
75240	no matter what no matter how many times
77250	you press on any key on this keyboard it
79799	will always stay well illuminated and
82850	distinctly numbered or lettered
84780	according to how the manufacturer
87180	intended okay so let's get the keyboard
90570	oh you got a warranty guide here which
92490	is gonna tell us some little something
93990	about our probably two-year warranty I
96270	believe
97650	[Music]
100450	yeah okay you know what I think the
104180	packaging for course they're usually oh
105620	there we go its two-year warranty okay
107330	so two year warranty we've got a Quick
108920	Start Guide which probably pretty much
110390	hit oh that's great
111980	full-color illustration of plug the
115250	things into the thing also download the
118460	software for managing your macro
121100	profiles and whatnots from Corsair comm
123530	slash vengeance k9t alright so that's
126800	all pretty self-explanatory what else we
128449	got in here we have any rest rest rest
130490	rest can make or break a keyboard and
134380	one of the ways they make a keyboard is
136880	by being shaped and well and supporting
139640	your wrist in a in a fashion that is uh
141860	you know good
143900	and one of my favorite wrist rests of
146120	all time is actually on the SteelSeries
148070	7g which is also a mechanical keyboard
150110	like this one more on mechanical in a
152060	bit and the way that they can usually
154459	break a keyboard it is by breaking and
158540	that often comes down to the mechanism
161300	employed by the manufacturer to attach
163610	the rest rest to the keyboard which is
165470	usually just you know a couple of little
168410	metal tabs although these ones seem to
170690	be fairly well built I can put a lot of
172610	pressure on them they're not going
173660	anywhere
174019	so Corsair has sort of seen that
177230	probably in action I mean there guys are
179660	I've met a lot of the force their team
181820	and their total enthusiasts so they've
183620	probably encountered wrist rest breakage
186530	in the past actually my own g15 has has
189830	a broken wrist rest which is one of the
192230	reasons that it's no longer in service
194330	so what they did is it went okay let's
196820	one up the rest of the industry and
198590	let's put check this out thumb screws
202030	which you can also screw in with a
204110	Phillips head screwdriver which might
205280	actually be easier based on my
206660	experience with my fingers here thumb
209120	screws in the sides to make sure also
212209	all look at this look at this so it
214220	keeps it from going too far here okay
217269	with the shape of this lip and then
220190	keeps it from coming up too far once
222019	again with this rather than putting all
225140	the pressure on these little plastic
227180	clips which no matter how well you build
229520	them are prone to brain
231739	so way to go of course they're for
234620	seeing what everyone else is doing and
236590	seeing why it was wrong and fixing it
239629	with a you know three cent piece of
241760	metal excellent love it okay well
244790	actually you know what why don't we
245749	finish up on the bottom here before we
247670	go I say look at that accidentally like
249260	went too far and it's fine
250519	we've got a couple of these little hide
252889	adjust tilt the dusty dudes we've got
254930	one two three four five six seven rubber
259339	non-slip grip e feet um some experts
262880	believe that it the use of any keyboard
264590	may cause serious injury so like be
266599	careful and stuff
267710	alright let's flip this back over so I
270229	think we're done with the underside of
272330	the keyboard why don't we go ahead and
274130	I'll show you guys the pass through here
275900	so this beak okay here
278000	so it's labeled with two arrows that
280310	means pass through that's the one that
281599	actually runs the keyboard so it's a
283430	pass through which means that this is a
284900	fully powered and fully speeded USB 2.0
289490	port because there's no actual hub
291919	splitting going on inside the keyboard
294289	so you go ahead you plug your mouse in
295550	there or you plug your mouse directly
296690	into the back you plug a USB key in
298250	there it's all gonna work just fine
300560	so yes mechanical keyboards this is a
302900	mechanical keyboard at least most of the
305870	keys commonly used for typing are
307750	mechanical so the only keys on this
310310	keyboard that are not mechanical are
312349	these ones right here the macro key is
314870	part of the reason that course are opted
316729	to go with a regular well now these days
320000	it's a regular dome switch key for these
322639	guys is because they wanted them on a
324979	different plane than the main keyboard
329060	so see how these are quite a bit lower
331039	down than the rest of the keyboard this
334699	is actually for a very interesting
336020	reason now if you've ever owned a G 50
338960	and I have a D 15 Gen 1 which was kind
341300	of the first keyboard to really do the
342889	whole matrix of programmable keys over
346460	here
346789	you've probably pressed this key instead
349610	of your escape any number of times so
351919	you go for escape you go oh why isn't
353960	escape working so that was why they went
356599	and they put these down lower so that
358370	you can easily tell when you're
360500	operating the keyboard when you reach
361880	the edge of the real
362849	keyboard and the beginning of the macro
364830	keys so that's very cool
366149	you've got three profiles for these so
368099	you've got eighteen keys times three
370319	profiles right there and you can manage
371819	that using the Corsair software
373559	you know actually another thing we
375209	haven't quite finished up with yet is
376709	the wrist rest so it uses like a
378300	rubberized dimpled feel actually feels
381839	very nice it's like Merle it's like a
383490	soft touch type material yeah yeah quite
387629	nice and should be fairly durable just
389459	based on how deep the dimples are so it
391529	should maintain that textured surface
393389	which i think is great for gaming gear
395099	because if you're gonna sit there and
396119	use it for a long time a lot of the time
397589	you can get sweat on it which means that
399479	if it has those recesses then you'll
401069	still maintain that bat slight
403169	grittiness even in the presence of palm
406110	moisture so yeah that's good uh what
410369	else oh yeah yeah yeah mechanical so
412169	mechanical keys ah everything but these
414539	guys the f keys all on the top here and
417749	then this block of keys right here
420360	these are mechanical these are all
422969	mechanical can you hear the difference
428689	okay so the reason course are opted for
431279	partially mechanical is because all of
433349	the typing all of the actual typing
435689	surfaces are going to give you that that
438180	typing feedback that a lot of people do
441089	desire and then the other ones that are
443550	very much less frequently used things
445860	like you know Escape and f9 and page up
448740	and page down are not mechanical the
451289	number pad is the arrow keys are let's
453869	have a look at some of the other
454800	functionality here so we've got our
456539	media keys so there's your volume scroll
458219	wheel this is one of the better
459059	implemented volume scroll wheels I've
460619	seen in the past got that nice this is
462539	not a sticker this is an actual texture
464819	to the to the wheel so it's very nice
467039	mute button stop back pause for word
470699	there are your LED indicators of your
473189	number lock caps lock and scroll lock
475259	you got a Windows disabled key and
477199	backlight control yes this one actually
479610	does have a backlight mechanical keys
482369	let's see if I can take one of these off
484079	fairly easily how about this one
488790	No okay there we go okay so these are
493140	cherry MX red keys the actual
496230	preferences vary dramatically from
499170	person to person
500610	what kind of keys they prefer so really
505680	the solution is probably to try them
507330	very shortly we're actually going to
509070	have Corsair keyboards and pretty much
510990	every NCIX store for you guys to just
512760	sit in front of them and play around
515130	with them a little bit because all
516630	mechanical Keys whether they're Browns
518370	blacks blues reds I think there's even a
521400	clear one but those are a lot less
522720	common do have a slightly different feel
524850	a slightly different sound of course
527130	they are determined that for their
528360	purposes the Reds were the most
529980	desirable for as a balance between
532470	gaming and typing another thing that
534870	you're gonna see here next to the red
536840	mechanical switch right there is
538820	actually one of the things that's I do
540870	like about them though is they're fairly
542430	quiet compared to some of the other
544350	mechanical keys is that is your blue
547110	light and so every single key has one of
550620	those lights and it not only illuminates
552660	the key but also kind of the area around
554130	it on the aluminum backboard that is
557880	part of this keyboard so one of the
559860	things you might notice about it if you
561570	see here is there's actually quite a bit
563310	of space under the keys between the
566910	actual the the rigid backplane and the
569730	keys themselves this makes it a little
571350	bit easier to clean and it also gives it
573960	kind of a unique look I've never seen a
575700	keyboard where they've done this before
577170	because every keyboard does have a
579000	backplane like this sorry I'm still a
582060	little sick that the keys are attached
584970	to but most of them cover it up with
586530	something which often leads to the
588330	accumulation of dust and dirt and
589890	doesn't really serve any other real
592230	purpose a couple times I haven't talked
594180	about yet although I did talk about them
595860	in my k60 overview are the full matrix
599480	artful full key matrix anti-ghosting
602190	which just basically means no matter how
603600	fast you type no matter what
605070	combinations of letters you press you're
606570	not going to accidentally register any
608400	additional additional letters or
611040	anything like that this is more of a
612750	software feature it's built into the
614400	software of the keyboard to make sure
616200	that everything is registered
618130	correctly over USB because USB does on
621370	some keyboards that don't implement
623230	these features USB does have some
625720	limitations another one of the
627040	limitations of USB is that typically you
629020	can only press I believe it's six keys
630610	at a time so 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the last
635740	one will not be registered at all
638070	what Corsair has done is they've given
640450	you up to a 20 keys so that's a 20 key
643180	rollover where you can actually yes
645190	press 5 6 7 8 9 and like you can press
651730	20 keys before it will actually stop
653680	registering keystrokes which is pretty
655600	much the practical limit of actually I'd
658690	say that's above the practical limit of
660130	how many keys most people can press at a
662290	given time I just want to make sure
663850	there's nothing I've missed here you
665230	guys could actually I never even showed
666850	you guys the box really
668020	so there's Corsair to look at it fully
670720	customizable profiles 36 kilobytes of
672760	onboard memory it sounds like a really
674050	old computer hey I bet I bet if you
676600	showed this to sone you're like yeah
677710	it's about 36 km emery on a keyboard
679630	they'd be like oh that's crazy
682480	sorry I digress yeah yeah last thing I
685690	want to do is I do want to put this in
687250	for you guys and I'm gonna turn off the
688600	lights in here so I'm just gonna go
690430	ahead and run this around to the back
693640	end of my test bench here we're gonna
697030	plug that into a USB 3 port just for
698890	giggles so you guys so I can say it's
700840	USB 3 compatible of whoo
702880	ok and then you know hey I'll show you
704650	guys in the light first there you go it
706480	has just a beautiful beautiful backlit
709240	look because not only are the keys
711130	illuminated but you also see a very
712510	distinct glow behind the keys themselves
715540	remember guys here it's pan around and
717400	have a look at the lights we've gotten
718780	here so yeah on the other side so this
722380	is in my my little tech tips filming
724450	room here and that is how much you can
727180	still see the blue so I'm gonna go ahead
729580	and turn these like ah 1 2 3 and you'll
735010	see how much that's gonna stand out in
736660	the dark this is one of the strongest
737980	back lights that I've seen on a gaming
740020	keyboard yet and as I said before one of
742570	the most striking looking because of the
745390	individually backlit keys and the way
747700	that the the back board for the keyboard
750640	itself is a little bit for
751740	other away so it gives it a bit more
753300	room for the glow to spread out just
755820	looks outstanding in the dark so I think
758820	that pretty much covers it I'll turn one
760440	of these back back on just so you can
762270	see me again thank you for checking out
764310	my unboxing and first look at the
766320	Corsair Vengeance k9 t don't forget to
