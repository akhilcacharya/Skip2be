30	today I'll be unboxing my all-time
1770	favorite Mouse this is the SteelSeries I
5339	carry laser it is as I just said my
10230	all-time favorite Mouse and I have used
12269	a lot of mice from the likes of Razer
14759	Microsoft SteelSeries all of the big
17670	gaming companies Logitech and this one
21150	is just the best as far as I can tell
24539	now you might ask me why I'm unboxing
26849	something that is already my favorite
28500	and I haven't told you this yet but I
31109	already have over a year's experience
32969	using this Mouse and the reason is that
35489	mine finally gave up the ghost I've been
37800	using it for a long time and it started
40829	acting a little bit weird started
43079	registering single clicks as as a double
46050	click and so I mean I talked to
48030	SteelSeries about it they said that's a
49620	very unusual occurrence I do believe
51449	them because I've got a fair amount of
53160	other SteelSeries gear in my house and
54960	I've never had any problems with any of
56460	it but yeah anyway my old one was acting
60570	a little finicky so I got a new one
62489	shipped over and I am unboxing it so
65220	inside the box which I haven't managed
68369	to focus the camera on just yet I've
70470	just been kind of talking here inside
72479	the box you will find pretty much the
74189	mouse okay you'll find a plastic cover
77400	for the mouse you will also find a
79979	silica gel throw it away do not eat it
83100	please next you will find some more do
86310	not eat and then you will find out okay
90180	here we go here well we have little
94100	that's kind of neat so you unfold this
97259	and then there's a SteelSeries logo
98670	hidden in the packaging like that it's
102060	like completely hidden away until you
103890	until you open up the little doors and
106500	then behind those doors you will find a
109500	SteelSeries icarly's our driver software
112500	which actually okay i'm about to do
115049	something unusual you can go ahead and
117420	install the drivers from the disk
119340	because I don't believe that SteelSeries
121439	has ever updated this software the
124290	version on there
125030	site is version 1.0 and this is version
127100	1.0 if if it's still if it's still like
130429	that and so I guess it goes to show you
132500	you're right a driver well the first
134569	time you never deal with it again
136700	I have a SteelSeries sticker I also have
140420	a little SteelSeries brochure about
142430	their other products including headsets
145190	keyboards and mousing surfaces and then
148700	I've got a little manual for the iqari
150590	laser shows you how to configure your
153110	mouse which which buttons do what you
155420	can also reconfigure them all talks
157130	about the spec of the mouse as well as
159620	showing you how to do profiles and
162019	macros and button settings sensitivity
165290	settings that's one of the coolest
166370	things about this mouse just like the
168170	zai which has actually come out to sort
170360	of replace the iqari laser I've got as I
173870	over there but it's kind of attached to
175850	a computer so it'll be kind of tricky to
177560	show it to you but just like design the
179569	iqari laser can be controlled in
181250	software to within one CPI now CPI is
185300	you can think of it as kind of like dpi
187580	but it's actually counts per inch rather
189380	than dots per inch so you can make
191239	adjustments unlike most gaming mice
192980	where you can go okay you know 500 700
196880	1200 dpi those are your those are your
198890	levels you can actually take the Akari
200630	laser and you can set it to 623 CPI or
204620	you can set it to 624 CPI of 623 is a
208100	little too low now I personally find
210410	that to be one of the best features of
211970	this mouse and the next best one has got
214070	to be that this driverless that means
216049	that you you actually program your CPI
218630	settings your macros everything you want
220640	into the mouse itself it has onboard
222380	memory and when you plug it into the
224299	computer I'm going to show you there's
226070	actually a little display on the bottom
228410	just like this I just gonna plug that in
231230	so I can show you gold plated USB
233329	connector I should probably mention that
235160	okay so there's a little display on the
237440	bottom I'll zoom in so you can see it if
239239	I could just find my remote that shows
242209	you which profile you're using so you
244160	can set up a bunch of different profiles
245630	save them on your computer and then you
247640	can just easily check the bottom of the
249079	mouse to see which one you're using and
250640	that it just takes all of that profile
252410	information and you do not have to
254120	install any drivers on a
255470	you use the entire laser on and let me
258709	see what else should I talk about
259700	software is really easy to use you've
261829	got a couple of different oh yeah you
263180	can only adjust it for two different dpi
265970	or CPI settings so you press the button
268820	on the top and that light switch is to
270650	higher low and then I honestly I found I
273830	only needed to I needed one for regular
276080	use someone for sniping and then when
278600	you've got that because you can adjust
280130	it to such a fine degree you don't
282380	actually need to tinker with it a whole
283850	lot it has back and forward buttons on
286160	the side I'm doing a lot of zooming here
288020	I apologize for that
289130	has back and forward buttons on this
290900	side for your thumb and I should
293180	probably talk a little bit about the
294680	shape it's a fairly light Mouse but this
296390	is easily the most ergonomic Mouse that
299840	I have ever encountered ever because it
304250	just melts in your hands so to speak I
307580	mean it still works after the melting is
309890	all done but it just melts in your hand
311570	it is perfectly like it feels like an
314030	extension of your body when you're
315470	guiding it over a surface so that's
317660	pretty nice oh yeah it has nice big
319340	non-slip arm rather non-slip it has nice
321830	big slippy feet on the bottom so it's
323990	suitable for use with a hard surface as
325730	well as a soft surface I actually use a
328220	cloth pad with it the SteelSeries qck
331760	plus so it's their large thin cloth pad
335120	since I got this one they've actually
336380	released a thick a couple thick ones the
338360	mass as well as the heavy and I wouldn't
341030	mind trying one of those but it works
342380	exceptionally well the qck series thank
345080	you for checking out my unboxing of the
346850	steel series I carry laser my favorite
350150	mouse I've actually had a lot of people
351650	messaged me asking me about my favorite
353570	mouse this is it
