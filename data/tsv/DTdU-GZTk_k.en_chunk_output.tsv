3870	that you want to work for your free
5879	30-day unrestricted trial go to
7980	FreshBooks com forward slash line of CES
10469	and enter - tech tips and the how did
12750	you hear about us section
13830	we're here at glowforge checking out
16109	their glowforge it's a laser etcher and
19109	cutter that is more set up and designed
21390	for everyone to be able to use instead
23550	of just engineers and the features that
26400	bring it to that point start with their
28500	easy web app where you can upload 3d
30929	grayscale images and raster or vector
33300	formats it can auto detect the material
36120	that you put inside if you use there
38100	proof grade materials if not you can
40230	just tell it what material is inside it
42570	can cut things or engrave things like
44820	plastics and woods and it has lots of
47160	really cool automatically based features
49079	like the one we used here which was able
51510	to cut our logo into a puzzle without us
55079	doing any extra work and the quality of
57239	life improvements just kind of keep on
58980	going it has a camera built into it so
61020	that you can actually see what the laser
63210	engravers see so when you need to set
64920	your object inside you don't have to do
66810	it with a whole bunch of different
67619	measurements and stuff you can just line
68970	it up with a camera and you're good to
70560	go it also is able to auto focus the
72900	camera along a curve so if you're doing
74850	something like engraving the top of a
77070	Macbook it can see the edges and engrave
79860	along the edges autofocusing the laser
81720	so you don't have any mistakes on the
83340	side and you don't have to do anything
84540	way too fancy they use mirrors to
86640	redirect the laser this can sometimes be
88200	an issue because if the mirror is
89490	misaligned
90270	it can cause various problems we would
92430	prefer that they use something like
93750	fiber optics but they put the mirrors
96450	into solid aluminum blocks and once a
98729	bolt is in place those things aren't
100140	moving so it should probably be fine the
102000	delicate components in the head are also
103770	completely sealed off which is great
105540	because that means less maintenance for
107670	you as it won't be able to get gummed up
109259	but if you do need to access it you can
111360	just simply remove it with a few magnets
112890	there's three stepper motors to move
114780	everything around you've got one on each
116460	side to control the y-axis and then one
118799	in the back to control the x-axis the
121110	laser moves along with the head in terms
123540	of the y-axis to keep everything aligned
126600	thing that you might notice is that it's
127950	not the biggest unit ever but that
129508	doesn't completely limit you in terms of
131730	y-axis printing you can actually print
133709	things that go pretty far because it has
136560	a pass-through slot so you can feed
138480	things through the laser engraver while
140640	it's going so it doesn't completely work
143489	right now but theoretically what will
145440	happen is you'll put part of it in it'll
147959	laser engrave what it needs to it'll cut
150180	what it needs to and then when it's
151650	ready you can feed more of it in and
153959	they'll just do the next part and so on
155640	and so forth until you're done but said
157680	pass-through slot does come at an
159690	additional expense if you do want the
161910	basic version that's four thousand
164040	dollars it comes with a 40 watt laser
165600	and that's about it no pass-through slot
168330	no built-in venting if you do want to
171180	vent it out you can send it out through
172590	a window or you can just do it outside
174540	or something like that or you can spend
176970	a thousand dollars and buy that built-in
178860	vent if you want to jump up to the pro
180569	version that's eight thousand dollars it
182549	has that $1,000 vent built-in it has the
185850	pass-through slot and it has a 45 watt
188459	laser so that can do faster cuts well
190890	for the average consumer
192150	definitely including myself this is
194100	really expensive it is cool to see a
196530	more consumer focused laser etcher slash
198720	cutter now you don't just have to be an
200340	engineer or have one at your school or
202109	something like that you can do this at
203400	home if you can afford it
205260	speak your be able to afford things be
207150	able to afford more things by using
208620	fresh books and running your business
209910	through it you can create invoices in
211470	less than 30 seconds you can get paid up
213450	to four days faster you can see when
215730	your clients have seen your invoice so
217200	if you're running a company that makes
219000	really cool purses or draft signs with a
221430	laser enter slash cutter you would be
223500	able to get your invoices created really
225329	quickly be able to see if your customers
227130	cannot have actually seen your invoices
228810	and you can go on from there if you want
