350	so today we're going to be having a look
3060	at the the G 9 and the g 9 X now I
6330	grabbed both of these from inventory
8330	thinking there might be some difference
10500	between them now as far as differences
13620	go you can see that they both have PC
17100	USB connection they both have laser
19470	tracking they both have nine buttons
21119	they both have a tilt wheel they both
23130	have full speed USB adjustable
24660	sensitivity weight tuning hyper-fast
26460	scroll and onboard memory they both
28289	literally have exactly the same bullet
30029	points down here the difference as far
32790	as I can tell is that this has a
35190	next-generation gaming laser featuring
38540	5600 dpi whereas the old g9 uses an
43260	older laser with 3200 dpi so we're not
46649	even going to bother unboxing the g9
48450	because it's exactly the same thing as
50879	the g9 X except for the one small change
54690	so let me see yeah
57570	thirty two hundred and fifty seven
59609	hundred dpi for the new one okay so
61530	let's open up the g9 X here and get this
63930	unboxing show on the road now the g9
66290	original is actually my second favorite
69299	mouse ever I use one at work and if
71159	you've seen some of my videos you'll see
72720	it on my desk there the one complaint I
74790	have about it is that the middle of them
76229	the scroll wheel is metal and it often
78360	shocks me when I sit down at my desk but
80250	what can you do the ergonomics are great
82530	it's kind of a hybrid between a claw
84420	grip and a palm grip and I find it very
86670	very comfortable it tracks incredibly
88409	well on a variety of surfaces and I
91200	guess that's about as much gushing as I
93060	really need to do I don't know if you
95670	were able to read that while the
96869	cameraman was looking at it but there's
98729	a durable low friction corded braid
100950	there's a corded braid braided cord
103280	in-game sensitivity if you have profile
105659	okay so these buttons right here you're
107130	allowed to switch between four different
108450	levels of dpi or sensitivity the back
111180	and forward buttons are invaluable when
113340	you're browsing the internet and they're
114930	here or here then it comes with two
116729	different grips so you can either use
118409	the wider grip or the narrower grip
120180	depending on the size of your hands
121530	which is a great feature you can have
123810	adjustable weight in the mouse I use
125520	mine fully loaded up but not everyone
127409	likes a heavy mouth so you can lighten
128878	it up that way that's pretty much it
131910	yeah okay so why don't we get
133890	Oh dry grip technology this is stupid
136050	again if you've seen the one in my blog
137959	video is the one that's on my desk you
140220	can see that the grip is totally coming
141870	off the mouse and the reason for that is
144720	because they use like this weird like
146550	rubberized grip tee material that sort
148860	of peels after a while and looks like
150570	your mouse has leprosy so that I guess
153570	would be my one complaint about this
156270	mouse and I mean that's a fairly minor
157860	thing in the grand scheme of you know
160739	the world but that is my complaint about
163200	the g9 mouse and the g9x seems to be
165780	more of the same except better so why
168390	don't we start with the accessory
169650	package here let's get this opened up
171239	first of all it comes with a user's
174810	guide okay so that wow the user's guide
177570	is actually really thick for a mouse it
179459	seems to have about 300 different
180810	languages no for sorry English Spanish
183780	French and Portuguese of all things then
186239	you've got the same information that we
188580	found on the box how do you plug in a
190170	USB port how to change the
192180	interchangeable grips how to turn on oh
194160	I'll have to show you this after the
196019	micro gear precision scroll wheel so you
197880	can actually press a button on the
199709	bottom of the mouse and then you can
201269	either scroll without clicks and you can
204480	just flick it and it'll go for a really
205980	long time like if you have hundreds of
207390	lines in an Excel spreadsheet or you can
209640	set it click it again on the bottom of
211170	the mouse and you can have like clicky
212430	clicky line-by-line scrolling okay tune
215130	for the way you play oh yeah you can
216480	change the color the LEDs on the top of
218100	the most the one on my desk is pink but
219570	you can change it to whatever you want
220860	green blue brown set point 5.2 download
225630	the latest off the Logitech website
227190	they're always updating with new
228600	features and stuff like that so you want
230310	to make sure you're grabbing the latest
231480	copy yeah here they're saying download
234120	the latest g9x software blah blah blah
235739	so that's pretty much what I just said
237060	FCC compliance who cares
239250	USB usage some USB hubs oh they're
242579	saying this is a high powered Mouse so
245130	basically you won't necessarily be able
247079	to use it in an unpowered USB hub now
249600	that brings me to some of the Gigabyte
251130	boards that we've unboxed and have a
253019	look at recently which offer their 3x
255750	USB power feature so that means that if
258089	you had a gigabyte board and you plugged
259858	it into a hub it could easily run a few
262380	of these mice even though you're using
264240	an unpowered hub because there's
266130	much more power coming from the USB port
268350	so as I was talking about with the
270690	general ergonomics of the mouse you can
272250	see it's quite a comfortable grip the
274020	the butt end of the mouse so to speak
276180	sits in your palm but then you actually
278220	grip the rest of the mouse with kind of
279960	a fingertip grip so that's what I meant
281430	by saying it's kind of a hybrid between
283530	the two and it has a little groove here
285210	for these two fingers and then a groove
287100	here for your thumb and the back and
288690	forward buttons are quite comfortable
290070	and easy to reach on the side now at the
292920	bottom of the mouse this is the micro
294510	gear button where you can switch between
297140	okay can you hear that so that's just
301110	spinning and spinning and spinning and
302370	then you can switch between that and
305030	like a more clicky mode okay at the
307620	bottom you can change the profile I'd
309120	never do that I can't imagine why you
310620	would these Teflon feet are great
312300	they've taken forever in a year to wear
314730	out I'm using it on an aluminum mouse
316500	pad so they should be wearing out fast
318060	but they're doing really well I've had
319710	this mouse for yeah like well over a
321660	year okay and then this button right
323700	here there you go is for removing the
326310	interchangeable grips so here I'm gonna
327960	show you the other one as well so this
330000	is the more slim grip I never use this
332760	one mine is in like new condition but
336570	should you desire to use the slimmer one
338370	you just pop it on like that all the
339930	buttons are still exactly where you
341460	expected them but the ergonomics changed
343380	quite a lot so I mean I guess if you're
345480	more fingertip grippy you see it no
347850	longer makes contact with the palm for a
349620	comfortable grip on the mouse so it's a
351960	user preference thing but you have to
353730	take the tops off actually in order to
356580	access the spring-loaded
357900	wait cartridges so there we go and
360090	that's another accessory that I haven't
361500	shown you yet is the little wait box so
364800	you can load it up with up to 28 grams
367680	or any combination of for gram and seven
370110	gram weights you can put up to four in
371550	it at a time and then you just go in
373470	there like that and I think that pretty
375780	much concludes everything I wanted to
377400	say about the g9x laser thank you for
379830	checking out my unboxing and product
381630	overview
