7160	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9830	the elite June L Drouin RPG RL drew and
15199	optimized for RPG depending on how far
17869	into the fine print you want to get
19970	speaking of fine print this mouse has an
22939	absolutely ridiculous amount of fine
24680	print they even explain what the Legion
27080	branding is about him Lita gin is
29720	composed of two words lead and Legion
31970	alright for the uninitiated the word
34550	leet is an internet phrase derived from
36860	the word elite blah-blah-blah often used
39079	something something something all that
40399	stands before them so yeah they're
42140	explaining what leet means which it I I
44899	hope isn't an indicator of who they're
47629	expecting to buy these mice because then
49370	it would be only for noobs should I
51199	explain what noob is a noob is sort of a
53149	play on words of the you know the word
55519	boob and new and you know and rube which
62420	is a word that means that you're done so
64430	Omron microswitches two of those for the
67190	left and right click him extreme
69680	durability and reliability got it
71600	omni tuner fast switch your profiles
74180	okay well show you this once we open it
75469	up DPI micro tune real time on the fly
77899	DPI tuning so this kind of goes with the
79909	profile switching removable palm plates
81829	choose your own texture size and style
84020	and the s pad which is basically a
87320	five-way d-pad so box wise we're gonna
90950	go ahead and switch to the camera that I
92570	meant to be looking at this from and
94509	it's kind of an awesome box so the
97070	packaging opens up like that and this
100490	comes off like that and then this comes
103369	apart like this and the mouse looks
105350	freaking sweet actually oh I'll give it
109009	that
109250	the mouse looks awesome it also has
111469	there you go one of the included plates
115130	so it comes with a couple of different
116299	plates so go ahead and put that on right
118520	there so take this out this is a not a
123079	thing okay let's find out what's in here
125619	Quick Start Guide in the shape of the
128300	mouse itself shows you how to sort of
131360	find the buttons that are on it and how
133010	to find the other more different buttons
134420	so there's your middle button there's
136250	four more buttons around it on the left
138200	side there's your 11 and 12
140720	over on the right side they couldn't
142400	quite figure out which way to put the
143750	text on that probably okay there's your
146450	manual presumably there will be some
150020	more instructions in here other than
151310	what we were able to find on the website
152510	oh good we're gonna need that because
154700	there's not a lot of info out there look
157550	at that they include replacement not
160790	flippy pads that is awesome although I
164180	wouldn't necessarily expect them to wear
166010	out right away and they are covered with
167480	a plastic cover guys so make sure you
169220	don't use the mouse before you've
170330	removed those there we go these look
172250	like pretty standard material for slip
175400	pads come on there we go yeah looks like
178370	about the stuff that you see on any kind
180020	of quality Mouse let's go ahead and pull
181880	that out and diesel can go ahead and
183860	grab some footage of the mouse itself
185960	while I figure out what the hell else is
187940	in this package because I can't think of
190880	too many other things that would be know
192080	okay so there's a couple more couple
194210	more palm plates so there's actually
195710	three included total for included total
198080	okay so you pick get to pick your color
200720	and your size and your texture so that
203180	sort of corresponds to what they said on
205100	the packaging and make sense now in
207620	retrospect so let's go ahead and see how
209120	how hard these are to pop off so you
211160	just kind of pull them off I guess yeah
214070	there you go and then you can go with
216560	what are the so that's okay it just says
218600	I'll drew it on the back so you can go
220730	with sort of a smaller hand shape one so
223370	that I'd say is more like four sort of
226310	very very small hands like kid hands
228290	girl hands and then the bigger one
232360	that's more suitable for someone with my
234800	size hands so there you go there's your
237310	I've got these in the way I've gold
239900	plated USB connector as well as a
241430	braided sleeve very very nice you've
243260	also got velcro strap here for managing
246739	the cable should you so desire alright
248840	so now let's get into what the heck all
251570	of these buttons do so there's your left
253010	to right click there's your scroll wheel
254060	which also has a click very nice scroll
255920	wheel it's very large it goes all the
257510	way through the mouse and actually has a
259160	very very nice grip on it kind of
260870	reminds me of like a car tire the way
262940	that it's the way that it's gripped
264470	there so it's very very cool and then
266570	that's pretty much it except for these
268280	side guys so this is the skill power
270590	action d-pad so
273380	is a 5v5 way d-pad which isn't to say
276770	that it kind of goes in sort of north
278270	east south west quark or anything like
282080	that like it's it's up left right down
284930	left and in so it's actually a pressable
287900	button so what this does is it is fully
290810	programmable and gives you fast access
293090	to skills without the need to memorize
294650	complex button placements this is
295970	actually kind of a smart way to do it
297320	and I like it the d-pad is what I would
300470	do is i brace myself with my ring finger
302120	here and then use the pinky to operate
304610	this one and that gives me the ability
306260	to put enough force on the d-pad without
308950	accidentally clicking the left and right
310940	click so that's how I would actually use
312380	that ergonomics wise and then on the
314420	other side we have the omni tuner so the
316700	omni tuner does is a dial so you can see
318830	it actually spins like this and you can
320930	choose two things you can either change
322520	your profile and so that'll allow you to
324710	change your character profile or
326180	whatever else you could desire on the
328040	fly or you can actually change your dpi
330440	settings which is very very cool and
332660	you'll have corresponding LED lighting
334700	indication that you can configure in the
336740	software so that way you'll know just
339200	looking at the mouse what profile that
341150	you happen to be in now I'm gonna go
343490	ahead and plug the mouse in because it
345050	has dual zone lighting which is a good
347330	thing to actually show there we go power
351260	that on plug that in so I can show you
354440	guys what it looks like once it's lit up
356470	and let's see what else we've got here
359270	okay so it's not lit yet I actually
361640	don't see where the lights go but I
363680	guess we'll figure that oh there we go
364940	oh there we go
366200	right there so red is dpi micro tune
370400	mode Blue is profile selection mode
372530	yellow is button mode and sky blue is
375110	Omni tuner off mode so those are those
377960	are the way that it's set up by default
379760	so there you go you can see that can you
382370	see that you can see that you're getting
384530	the thumbs up and then this guy right
386300	here is is configurable as well so thank
390650	you for checking out my unboxing and
393230	first look at the El drew an RPG from
395990	leat Jin leat delete Jian Li Jian region
400730	oh yeah I never even said what's right
402680	it's a 5000 dpi mouse with an Avago 9500
