30	thank you to a group were known for
989	sponsoring this video at CES 2018 you
2850	can check out there symbiosis concept
4410	car in the description down below we're
6420	talking with the Jenna vation KB 170 l
8580	and one other keyboard play you have to
10110	wait for that this one as you can see
11880	immediately has 66 macro keys at the top
15570	of the keyboard each one of those keys
17340	can take 220 character inputs you do
20789	that by switching a switch just right
22590	here on the back of the keyboard from
24269	program mode to keyboard mode and you
26400	can type all that kind of stuff in to
27810	program those individual keys there's
29880	only one profile for these keys but you
32369	easily switch to another mode by holding
35309	shift just like you would for any other
36780	key on the keyboard to switch to
38690	essentially another set of 66 more macro
42540	keys all of the keys at the top have
45120	these clear top covers on them so you
47190	can print out little cards for each one
49020	of them insert it under the top cover
50610	and then be able to reference what
52379	that's actually for in the future which
54300	is really helpful because well they're
56520	programmable keys so they're what you
58500	set them to not what they're
59640	pre-programmed for so they can't come
60899	with labels on them they are single-shot
63449	abs key caps naturally due to the cap on
65640	top of them and these standard qwerty
67470	keys are double shot key caps and I want
69659	to show you guys something right here
70770	this whole keyboard if I try to grab it
73350	pretty firmly on each side and try to
74970	twist it it essentially doesn't twist at
77580	all and I'm giving it quite a bit of
79110	force I have seen drastically more
81420	keyboard twists intend keyless keyboards
84240	that don't have three rows of macro keys
87000	above it then this one does it's it's
89040	build quite well there's a metal plate
90990	throughout the entire thing so ways to
93270	point to kilograms are four point eight
95250	five pounds that's a lot for a keyboard
96900	good for bashing zombies with or just
98430	staying where it's supposed to be on
100500	your desk they did however take some
102960	precautions and making it as compact as
105000	they could you can see compared to a
106920	standard keyboard there isn't this
108509	divide between the F keys and the normal
110700	core D keys they shrank that down
112380	whether that's a positive or negative
114149	I'm not entirely sure personally I think
116310	my muscle memory would make it so that
117630	when I go to press escape I would end up
119460	pressing this macro key in the corner
120990	but you know making the macro keys at
123990	the very top actually more pressable
125520	it's probably benefit for that so
126960	depends on you in terms of usability the
129389	switches are
130679	IMX blacks there's a USB pass-through
133319	port on the back of the keyboard and
135209	when you're in program mode there is a
137159	little light just next to numb log caps
139230	lock and scroll lock so that you know
140879	that you're in program mode and not
142170	typing though this keyboard was just
144209	announced at the show and will probably
145769	be available through Amazon but just in
147569	case you can get it at DSi - keyboards
149939	comm the backlit version will cost three
152340	hundred and forty dollars and the non
154650	backlit version will cost two eighty to
156810	ninety around there next up we have the
159329	lens in GK 358 which as you can see it's
162689	quite water resistant it's an IP 68
164669	rated keyboard meaning that it can be
167159	submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water
169769	for 30 minutes but they don't know the
172260	maximum depth that it can be submerged
173849	for because it's made for like spills
176310	and stuff not actually gaming underwater
178290	they did say however that it can be
180510	underwater to some degree for a boat up
183209	to a week which is pretty cool it's also
185459	only thirty bucks and features double
187469	shot injected key caps and back letting
190109	the backlighting is for different colors
192150	across the board not RGB LEDs but there
194940	is different lighting modes as well so
197040	if you hold the function key and press
198329	scroll lock it will change what lighting
200400	mode it's in we have experienced a
203159	couple glitches while sitting here but
205109	it seems to be only if you like get
207329	water on it and then lift it up
209010	vertically so the water goes up into the
211019	key caps that there is any problem so if
212549	you spill stuff on your keyboard maybe
214109	don't like pour the water into the top
216959	of the key caps and you'll probably be
218639	fine it does also feature an actually
220500	pretty nice colored metal top but there
223319	is a little bit of flex actually a fair
225689	amount of flex it is a thirty dollar
227129	keyboard so I maybe wouldn't worry about
228599	that too much this is the price range
230790	that you're shopping for
231780	it features an optical switch I have not
234090	personally seen before manufactured by a
236669	Taiwanese company called ever light
238949	other notable features is that there's
241079	RGB lighting along the sides of the
243419	keyboards which is pretty cool it's only
245129	two milliseconds of delay and this metal
247259	plate comes in either black or blue it
249659	will be available on Alibaba or BB r86
253290	comm so cool there's a keyboard that you
256380	can use literally underwater I'm typing
259079	right now and I can see it on the screen
260399	over there pretty sweet if you're more
262079	interested in things outside of the
263400	water whoever I'm gonna bring back our
265110	sponsor group run Ofra sponsoring this
267180	video
267509	lioness went to go check out their
268800	symbiote scar in France not that long
271199	ago and he was able to experience level
273240	4 automation that means he was able to
275190	sit in the driver's seat and not drive
277380	he just used his laptop while he was
279240	sitting there and it drove him down real
280560	roads in France with other cars on it
282360	really cool there's also tons of other
284280	cool tech inside of the car so be sure
285840	to check that out up here or possibly
288030	down in the link below see you guys next
290070	time like this video if you liked it
291479	dislike it if you dislike it get
292710	subscribe all that fun stuff and I
294600	already said I'll see you next time so I
295770	guess I don't really have anything else
298080	to say bye
