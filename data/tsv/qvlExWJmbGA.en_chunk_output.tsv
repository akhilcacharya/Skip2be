5290	[Music]
7760	welcome to my unboxing of the meiotic
10139	snails 8200 this is an all-new Mouse
14070	from neonics that actually takes what
15990	was already good about the nails 3200
18570	and the nails 5000 and kicks it up a
21390	notch so basically we've got what is a
23820	pretty standard overall package here so
26820	you can see a picture of the mouse with
28410	the green me onyx accents here although
30359	it should be noted that those colours
32430	can be changed to any one of sixteen
34380	point eight million color options using
37110	the programmable LEDs that can be
39390	changed within the software and it
41700	should also be noted that the ergonomics
44520	have thankfully not changed versus the
48120	previous nails mice they've also gone
49590	with an extremely small package so it's
51809	basically just the mouse and a couple of
54149	accessories tucked away inside of an
56190	outer box sensor specifications okay so
58469	8200 dpi laser 32 bit 72 megahertz ARM
62699	processor don't think of it in terms of
64830	72 megahertz think of it as 72 millions
68610	of Hertz
70430	sort of one way of looking at it right
72990	so okay let's go ahead and have a close
75210	look at the packaging here so we've got
77100	a little fold out piece here we've got a
79320	little plastic piece here I got to admit
80970	the packaging itself feels a little bit
83040	less deluxe than previous bionics mice
85110	but if the performance is anything - or
87990	if the performance is anything like what
89400	I'm used to then it should be just fine
91740	in fact my wife is a bit of a picky
94140	peripheral user and refuses to use
95820	anything but her nails 3200 or the 5000
98939	that she was using before but I craftily
101220	snuck away when she wasn't looking
103380	anyway so I'm going to get our b-roll
105630	camera to go ahead and have a look at
107310	what we've got here in terms of specs
108750	overall so award-winning ergonomic
110759	design extremely comfortable the overall
113670	shape of the mouse is quite frankly just
116850	awesome so you can see right here
118259	whether you have smaller hands like me
120719	or whether you kind of have bigger hands
122759	and you're going to need to be sitting
124350	back a little bit further the curve of
126390	the mouse is such that you can sort of
128788	sit back on it or choke up on it as much
130649	as you want and it'll be comfortable
132540	from either angle
133440	so I'm just going to go ahead and shift
135600	back over here so you can have a look
137160	from the other side so same thing here
138750	where you've got a curve right here for
140610	your pinkie a curve right here for your
142320	ring finger and then comfortable
144090	placements for your index and your
145950	middle fingers as well as for your thumb
148530	on the other side
151000	so yeah they haven't done away with that
153250	grip friendly rubber coating so it does
155020	use a soft touch feel overall to the
157210	mouse which I personally prefer I think
159400	that was a huge misstep for SteelSeries
161320	when they upgraded the side to the
162880	sensei
163480	now the newer the newer sensei with the
167790	MLG branding on it actually brings back
170680	that soft touch finish and I think that
172300	is a very very important thing three
174490	step in-game dpi adjustments okay this
176320	is pretty standard for gaming mice these
177790	days seven buttons overall so you've got
180850	your back and forward buttons here by
182830	the way they're all programmable you've
184300	got your dpi up and down buttons here
186100	your mouse wheel click as well as your
188650	left and right buttons here that is
190510	pretty much it in terms of glowy spots
192580	the mouse wheel
193510	these dpi indicators here as well as
196030	these buttons and the my onyx logo at
197890	the back will all glow in-game profile
202000	switching okay extensive programmable
203890	macros that's good 6 integrated LEDs in
206410	four colors own so you can actually have
208090	multiple different color zones that's
209530	kind of neat I actually didn't know that
210970	already
211330	color shift function so you can use
213100	solid blinking pulsating or breathing
215050	LED effects you can adjust the polling
217150	rate this is something that has been
219070	more of more of a thing in the more
221709	recent years actually a long time ago
223840	people didn't really talk about it at
224980	all I remember you used to have to do
226150	like a manual override to change your
228790	mouse to a 1000 Hertz polling rate so
231519	that's that's very good I mean a
233110	thousand Hertz is a thousand times a
234700	second which means we're taking the
235930	mouse down with a wired connection to as
238300	little input latency as is humanly
241180	possible or not humanly possible just in
243700	general possible large pH PTFE feet so
247480	these right here are going to be the
250600	slip pads that are going to make it so
252489	that you don't actually have any sort of
255030	unintentional grip up to the surface
257470	that you are putting it down on so
259418	hopefully you can see those pretty well
261160	there there we go
262210	so those should be quite durable like I
264160	said we've had one of their 3200 mice
267070	and deployment for quite a while no
269080	complaints whatsoever they're also quite
270490	thick so large and they have like quite
273790	a quite a thickness to them so they
275110	shouldn't wear down too quickly but if
277660	they do then
278530	sort of
278880	your mileage may vary I suppose can't be
281430	my fault gold plated USB connection this
283740	is less necessary than you might think
285030	and then it's got a two meter cable with
286680	braiding on it so let's go ahead and
287850	have a close look at that so the gold
289740	plating on the outside of the connector
291450	actually does absolutely nothing for the
293760	durability of the mouse it's just for
295830	looks mostly it's more important to have
297960	gold plating on the inside where those
299970	connectors are so gold is useful for
301980	these kinds of connectors because it
303660	doesn't oxidize and it's somewhat mailed
305940	malleable which means it's going to
307200	always make a good connection braided
309240	cable is high-quality it's a braided
311040	cable this is something we're used to
312450	seeing on gaming mice so that's good to
313980	see and we'll be back in a moment with
315750	the mouse lit up so you guys can have a
317010	look at it so basically guys this last
319500	little bit here it's just going to be to
321000	give you some overall glamour shots of
323430	the mouse itself I'm not even going to
325050	let Slick's camera have any of the
326670	action at all so I'm just going to sort
328650	of turn it over show you guys what it
330660	looks like
331440	I mean I have smaller ish hands in fact
333840	so it could even just put down his
334950	camera and come to a more practical
336720	demonstration of what a larger hand will
338940	look like on the mouse itself so here
340590	just kind of give them a bit of a view
343050	there so in fact here here's the mic
345360	what are you what are your impressions
346560	of the shape you've used one like this
347970	before right yeah yeah it can claw it
349950	still so that's really nice but then if
351600	someone had smaller hands they could
352650	palm it very easily
353460	although palming it with this as a hand
354900	is kind of ridiculous okay so there you
357270	go guys smaller hands can eat oh my
359550	goodness look how sweaty his hands are
360960	check this out not gross its disgusting
364280	so smaller hands palm is very easy very
367380	comfortable
368340	you could also clot with smaller hands
370230	but I'd say it's optimized for small
373380	hand palm large hand claw and then sort
376470	of in between I guess you could probably
378090	go either way because I have very small
379800	hands and then slick has very very large
381510	hands so I think that pretty much wraps
384090	it up oh yeah your four different LED
385740	zones are going to be here here here and
387510	here
