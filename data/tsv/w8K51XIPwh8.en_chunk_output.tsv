4830	more and start securing your passwords
6720	today so we're here in the Acer suite
9330	checking out the predator Orion 9000
12900	it's a new high-end desktop from Acer
15509	that basically takes every box that you
19289	could possibly imagine
20670	so from the outside it's got that
22500	aggressive gamer look I mean if you want
25680	you know a windowed side panel it's got
28019	that if you want like a mesh side panel
31140	it's got that too if you need a big
33420	aggressive logo it's got that if you
35430	want carbon fiber looking accents well
38969	it's got that and if you wanted RGB or
42149	if you didn't want RGB well it's got it
45300	either way so spec wise it's equipped
47789	with up to a core I nine extreme edition
51210	18 core processor up to a hundred and
54449	twenty eight gigs of ram up to dual GTX
57840	10 eighties t eyes it's got two m dot
60449	two slots
61320	it's got top Wow I mean what does it not
64049	have it's got dual front 120 millimeter
67080	fans with a single 120 millimeter
69030	exhaust and it's actually liquid cooled
71250	which is something I don't believe I've
73350	seen from an Acer desktop before no I'm
76320	getting the no we haven't done that
77790	before so there's an e io cooler with
79979	dual 120 millimeter fans on a radiator
82200	built up into the top in terms of IO
84840	it's got again pretty much everything
87000	this custom motherboard from Acer is
88890	actually pretty well equipped it's got
90540	four PCIe 16x slots it's got two of
93990	those 20 pin USB 3.1 front panel
97290	connectors and then two more of the
99060	older ones and the whole thing is
100770	powered by a thousand watt power supply
103710	so you can throw in whatever the heck it
105840	is that you want at the front which we
107790	actually managed to not look at yet you
109380	got the predator logo you got this kind
110909	of Tron esque RGB lighting you got a DVD
113549	drive and check that out my friends
116369	headphone holder just in case you didn't
118439	already have one on you know one of your
120240	Acer gaming monitors or whatever the
122040	case may be in terms of pricing we're
124259	looking at $19.99 but it should be noted
126299	that that's going to be significantly
128489	lower spec so that one would have it
130378	seems like eight gigs of RAM it's not
133080	clear whether
133569	would have an n dot to boot drive
135249	although I would say that's probably a
137079	bit of a long shot and that would ship
138700	with a gtx 1070 1070 right cool now the
143349	one thing I haven't told you guys yet is
145299	pretty much the best part so hold on I
147249	got to shut this baby down real quick
148810	here here we go
151139	so you're looking at this thing going
153280	but lightest it's so big how could I
156370	possibly travel to my land parties to
160540	which I would respond in style baby
164430	on the top you'll find handles and on
168189	the back you will find wheels a sir
175750	apparently got tired of shipping
177159	luggages with their computers and they
179530	have resorted to this so huge shout out

204099	needing to be on all the social accounts
205989	or hey you might run into a situation
207189	where all of a sudden maybe some brand
209739	like oh I don't know Huawei hands you a
211840	new phone that you are supposed to go
213549	and use at their event and you don't
