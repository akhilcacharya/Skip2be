30	so today I'll be unboxing the head Mouse
2610	- or the OCZ Nia neural impulse actuator
7379	+ I actually don't know much about this
9840	yet but I am about to hopefully learn a
13410	little something about it now I do know
15540	about the original Nia the original Nia
17970	used your basically your brainwaves
20310	facial expressions eye movements all
22740	that kind of stuff to translate into
25250	game control or just general PC control
28949	camera man also wants me to mention we
30750	have NCIX lanyards coming soon these are
33210	pretty sweet I actually already grabbed
35040	one for myself here so I've switched
37440	over my old lanyard to the new ncx
39780	lanyard so why don't we just have a look
41460	at what's on the back of the box here
42930	and it looks like they say pretty much
45059	what I already said so you can
47430	concentrate that I turn it into keyboard
50340	and mouse controls new levels of gaming
52260	not previously possible they tout it as
54329	a way to heighten the response time for
56520	intense games so you can have a thought
59359	faster than you can have a thought and
61829	then press a button is the theory okay
64799	they say it doesn't take a whole lot of
66840	time I've never actually used the
68760	original Nia or this one yet but I will
72119	take some time to use this thing and see
74159	what I think of it honestly the whole
77490	thing sounded like a gimmick to me and
79409	when they said well we'll send you one I
81450	said okay and I'm gonna approach this
87390	with an open mind because you know what
90360	I've been surprised by stranger things
93090	being better than I thought
94890	in the past so here we are it comes out
97380	of its little sleeve and then it's a
99479	white box which comes open somehow there
102540	we are
102869	oh that's actually a pretty nice
105119	presentation look at that okay so
107490	there's a piece of paper inside please
109049	read okay thank you for participate all
112890	this is probably not for this is
114869	probably not for end-users
116659	pre-release version of these so
119040	something something something updated
121860	biometric scan suite there's a bunch of
124979	new software that's going with
127330	neiha plus rather than the old Nia so
130330	that's pretty good
131080	and then hopefully I'll be able to give
132760	you a lot more details on this once I
136060	have a chance to go through this thing
138220	and actually test it so why don't we
140710	have a look at the included stuff in the
142480	box first we have the Nia unit itself
145080	okay so this has kind of a brushed
147610	aluminum thing it's got some dust on it
149650	but no big deal it has kind of like a
152530	curvy shape to it varied space-age
155590	looking I suppose its uses a USB
158110	interface and that looks like a reset
159670	switch in the back here let's go around
162040	to the front that is the end link so I'm
165040	assuming that's how it plugs into the
166780	headband and then up on the top we've
169090	got our Nia branding again little
170920	brushed aluminum box it's quite heavy
172570	actually so there's gotta be something
174130	inside there there's your ocz branding
177130	on the top there's my serial number the
179860	warranty is void if you remove that or
181660	that alright so there's the Nia unit
184090	itself and here is the headband it's
188470	quite flexible now they say it's one
190209	size fits all but I guess that remains
192700	to be seen and I'm gonna wait to click
194200	that on so we're gonna show you the
195940	other accessories first off this is just
197320	a USB cable and this is the Nia software
200650	pre-release version so it's on just a CD
203080	with a paper printed thing on it so I'm
206050	guessing the retail one will come with a
207670	proper CD oh this is cool this looks
210160	like little tentacles coming out of the
211750	back of your head so it's like this
213430	thing is like an alien or something so
215920	hold on there's gotta be instructions or
217810	something okay okay bear with me because
220300	I'm gonna try and figure out how to wear
222730	the headband if you are a beginner do
225370	this do that
227670	nope nothing they actually do not tell
231400	you how to put it on so it must be
234910	really easy then it must just be a
236470	matter of just putting it on this thing
238209	that's really weird actually it's kind
239830	of a Care let's just like look at the
241570	unit itself so it's got kind of a
243100	rubbery nough stu it okay and it's quite
247209	soft and sort of spongy feeling there's
250239	uh okay there's two oh here here this
253209	may be like pre-release hardware so
255010	might not be the actual fit and finish
256870	of it but basically there's a cord going
258820	in there in fact I can pretty much
259720	guarantee that
260589	not finalized fit and finish but
262690	hopefully it has all the functionality
264430	and then that ends in your little end
266260	link there so that'll come out this way
268750	and then here are the little pads that
271990	make contact with your head so that's
274360	what reads your your brainwaves and
277169	translates that into something that your
279220	computer can understand and then yeah so
281320	why don't we go ahead and put this on so
283540	it has to make direct contact with your
285370	skin
285910	in all likelihood okay you just press
288820	this little button here and you pull the
290229	tentacles out in order to expand the
293080	headband apparently I have a larger head
295450	than anyone at OCC was expecting okay
298600	and it goes on just like that and the
301300	camera man's got a big old smile on his
303550	face he thinks this is funny
304750	yeah well laugh it up maybe you'll be
307360	trying the NIA next cameraman okay thank
310060	you for checking out my unboxing of the
312610	OCZ Nia plus a head mouse or like
317050	headcrab and so head something anyway
