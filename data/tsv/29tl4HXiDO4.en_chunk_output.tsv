60	so what mystery do I have inside here oh
5150	it's another keyboard video light is why
8039	do you keep doing this to us well I
10139	think it's because coolermaster is like
12990	determined to get you to stop using mais
14580	IL 60 and I gotta say having only before
17490	used tofurkey switches the high-end
19980	electrostatic capacitive key switches on
22140	the Nova touch series in Suites at trade
24689	shows and never in the comfort of my own
26730	home doing my own work I thought this
28859	was going to end up being a very
30090	negative video and while they're still
31980	not my favorite thing in the world I
34350	might have judged them too hastily
36630	before Corsair gaming RGB keyboards
46320	feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
48629	switches for sixteen point eight million
50789	color / key backlighting for virtually
52980	unlimited customization click now to
55260	learn more so let's start with a
57090	physical tour first up it's a 10 keyless
59640	which means it's not going to make its
60930	way onto my desk no matter what I'm just
63210	not ready to give up my number pad yet
65040	but the rest of the features are
67080	actually pretty solid we've got support
68729	for any key rollover over USB in Windows
71430	something that may end up being a big
73619	selling point for shoppers built-in
75750	media keys that can be accessed with a
77340	function modifier a windows lock key and
79409	finally repeat rate modification which
81720	lets you change what happens when you
83220	hold down a key 1 X looks like this 2 X
86040	looks like this 4 X looks like this and
87900	8 X looks like this as you can see not
90960	too useful for typing but for executing
93299	commands within human speed in games
95430	hell there you go pretty handy on the
98850	sides in the front we find not a whole
100829	lot of anything on the bottom we find 4
102780	rubber pads and 2 rubber tipped feet
105540	that will angle the keyboard up if you
107729	prefer that orientation then at the back
109619	we find the only visible CM storm
111810	branding it's subtle and the user will
114450	never have to look at it if they prefer
115950	a cleaner overall look on the back we
118680	also find the removable braided cable
121829	that terminates in a micro USB cooler
125790	master WTF guys I let it slide last time
129720	but if you guys are wholesale switching
131340	to micro / mini be
133150	I have one question why anyway finally
142390	on top we find some unexceptional
144730	looking key caps and if you buy a nova
148030	touch you'll likely notice how quickly
149769	the laser etched white back filled
152409	characters fade to a dingy looking brown
154060	that is normal but the key caps in spite
157329	of their sort of unexceptional looking
159099	this especially compared to cooler
160269	masters other stuff where it's all like
161590	LEDs and stuff the key caps are still
164079	actually where things get interesting
165579	because unlike other Topor keyboards
169150	where you're pretty much stuck with
170920	whatever key caps come in the box the
172810	Nova touch tkl uses a custom purple 45
176590	grams slider across the board that has
179829	the standard circular stem and across
183310	Cherry MX compatible stem meaning that
186069	you can use the included key cap puller
188379	to strip the board naked and swap the
191530	included ones with pretty much any key
193659	caps out there that are compatible with
195700	cherry and NEX equipped keyboards pretty
198280	sweet but I think the next question is
200609	with the reputation of Cherry MX
202870	mechanical keyboards why would you even
204310	want a taupe or keyboard most people
206500	haven't even heard of it
207549	great question the typing experience is
210220	very different from cherry and while I
212440	don't really prefer it per se I was able
215769	to adapt to it extremely quickly I think
217569	part of the reason for this is that as
219970	much as I advocate for Cherry MX
221530	mechanical keyboards and I find them
223150	generally more comfortable and faster
224889	than rubber domes the keyboard that I've
227500	actually typed on more than any other is
229569	a Gen 1 Logitech G 15mm brain keyboard
233169	so the topor typing experience because
235840	the keys contain a spring but actually
238750	use a rubber dome for resistance and
240669	tactile feedback is much like that
243099	keyboard but with a nice long travel a
246489	more consistent feel and improved
248650	comfort I still find the tactile bump
250959	right at the top of the key press a
252519	little bit disconcerting
254349	by contrast Cherry's tactile bump is
256358	around the halfway mark very close to
257829	the actuation point which means that if
259959	you normally feel for the tactile bump
261668	and try to avoid bottoming out your
262900	keystrokes with Terry it's easy
264850	and with this one it's much more
266410	difficult but for me I lack finesse and
268480	I usually bottom out every time as I
270730	type anyway so yeah so anyway with all
274210	of that said the bottom line is that I
276160	actually found that for typing within
278440	about 10 minutes I was as fast and as
281020	accurate as my cherry MX keyboard that
282880	I've been using for a couple of years
284110	pretty darn impressive but for me and
286630	your mileage may vary especially here
288760	because this is keyboards gaming was
291550	where this keyboard really Shawn maybe
293290	again it's because over the years I've
295090	spent many more hours gaming on the g15
297610	gen 1 than probably every other keyboard
299890	that I've used combined but coming from
302080	a regular membrane keyboard to the Nova
304240	touch was an absolute treat to game on
307270	you won't get that same lightness of
309370	touch that many gamers who like Cherry
311560	MX reds or blacks will be looking for
314350	where you only have to go half way down
316210	and it's very easy to control but if
318160	you're coming from a membrane and want
320440	something similar without the Machinists
322600	of a cheapo keyboard I think you'll find
324430	yourself very pleasantly surprised by
327010	this little guy so that's where we're at
328780	I guess I missed one thing Coolermaster
330940	includes a bag of a rings so you can
333550	actually shorten the keystroke a bit and
335320	silence a little bit more but I found
337090	that particularly for typing the
339040	keyboard was so quiet anyway to begin
340780	with that I didn't need to use them for
342070	that and because I'm a bit of a
344320	brute-force typist and I like that nice
346150	long travel I left the o-rings off but
349300	all this is very personal and as usual
352320	with any kind of keyboard purchase I'd
355330	really recommend trying it before you
357550	buy it if there's any way that you
359110	possibly can
360370	if you can't then I hope that you found
362830	my first experience with the well the
365350	first really key cat modding friendly
367330	topor keyboard somewhat helpful guys
370150	like this video if you liked it dislike
