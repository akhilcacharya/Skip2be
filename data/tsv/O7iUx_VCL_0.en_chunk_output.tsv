30	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
2280	the Roccat Kone xtd they're calling this
5279	their Mac's customization gaming mouse
7350	now in terms of the actual performance
8610	and hardware specs it's not that
11219	different from something like a cone
13019	plus however the shape of the mouse is
14820	different and the customization is quite
17279	different so the first thing we're going
18570	to do is actually just whip open the box
21000	while we tell you some of the general
22410	specs so it has an 8200 dpi Pro r3 grade
26640	sensor so that's pretty much as high as
28830	it goes these days for gaming mice it's
31439	got 8 buttons however it does feature
33600	Roccat shift+ which allows you to use
35910	one of the buttons as a shift key and
37950	then assign additional functionality to
39870	all of the other buttons it has 576
42300	kilobytes of onboard memory allowing you
44129	to store a butt ton of profiles and
46500	macros and all that stuff that you'd
48210	want to do to have the mouse be as
49559	customizable as you could desire and
51500	unlike the cone what's it called poem
54809	pure I think I called it Plus before
56670	unlike the cone pure it has check this
61680	out these lighting strips now this is
65909	hard to demo without actually plugging
67799	it into something so we could probably
69420	we could probably we'll plug it into
71130	something in a moment but I'll show you
72390	guys the box you can actually set it up
74400	so there's 4 customizable LEDs so that
76799	you have different colors that blend
78750	into each other and these are these are
80930	multicolored LEDs so you can set them to
84119	any color of the rainbow you'd want and
85860	then have the mouse look like whatever
87540	you want now you can have it even change
89579	dynamically on the fly so using raw
91470	cat's software you can say okay well you
93810	know I'm being attacked so the mouse
95640	should glow red instead of a different
98040	color or I'm poisoned it should go green
99810	and not everyone stares at their Mouse
101430	father gaming in fact I think most
102780	people don't but it's still a neat kind
104520	of thing to have let's show you what the
106079	ergonomics look like so this is a
107909	right-handed organ AMA Klee shaped Mouse
110100	it is significantly bigger bigger than
112920	the cone P R so you can see the size
114869	difference right there where the cone P
116610	R is almost a claw Mouse for me this one
119460	there's no way I'd be able to claw grip
121409	it this is more of this is more of a
123540	palm Mouse for me however if we took
125280	someone with larger hands such as my
127710	handy Betty's here filming assistants
130889	lik you can see that that's that's way
132959	better right
133750	I don't think you could palm that though
135430	could you little little bit too small
140200	for baseball glove sized hands to palm
142540	but you can you can easily you can
145810	easily claw that right okay so there you
148660	go has eight buttons compared to the
150550	seven on the on the cone pier so we'll
153070	show you where the buttons are these
154270	these back and forward buttons are
156190	totally a must these days it's got a
158950	profile button here well remember you
161020	can program them to do whatever you want
162430	it's got a left and right sliding scroll
164350	wheel so up down click left right more
167800	profile switching these are probably for
169570	dpi switching by default you can tell
171160	from the labels on them but you can
173920	change them through whatever we want and
175209	then remember guys you can hold down
176950	shift and press any other button on the
181570	mouse and program that to whatever you
183880	actually want it to do now the cone xtd
187900	also has a weight system which is
189700	another thing that the pier doesn't have
191110	so we're going to go ahead and open
192640	those up so you've got four or five gram
194800	weights that you can easily put inside
197200	the mouse using the unlockable thing on
200980	the bottom here let's just go ahead and
202780	okay Oh apparently it's already open
205510	there so you can put as many or as few
207040	as you want I wouldn't have minded
208480	seeing them more towards the center of
210160	the mouse but I guess it's not the end
212140	of the world they stick in there just
213519	fine on their own but you can go ahead
215170	and lock them into place should you so
217269	desire on the bottom we see the 8200 dpi
219910	laser sensor as well as the Teflon
223959	slippy pads I do prefer to see a layout
227110	like what we saw on the cone pier where
229540	the top ones are one large piece rather
232180	than two separated pieces because
233590	sometimes there can be issues with these
235150	these ones coming off I'm not saying
237220	Rockets not using a whoops and adequate
241180	adhesive I'm just saying that I've had
242980	it happen in the past we have other mice
245500	so there you go take that for what it is
247930	and let's go ahead and plug this in ah
251680	there we go I got that locked into place
253090	now so this seems fitting taking some
256180	sort of their ultimate customization
258070	Gaming Mouse and putting it next to the
259630	ultimate single GPU gaming graphics card
262900	and I'm going to go get my cheat sheet
264970	that has any
265610	other notes that I wanted to talk about
267020	on the mouse so oh yeah the most feature
268819	is rocket talk looks like it probably oh
271610	I plugged it into a USB 3 port I don't
273500	know if we have the drivers installed
274520	for that new ok there we go so that
277400	might work so it has rocket talk which
279379	actually allows it to work in
281419	conjunction with other rocket items such
283669	as keyboards that feature rocket talk
285319	giving you kind of like like bonuses to
288889	functionality based on using matching
291110	gear like an MMO inspired kind of thing
293360	it does feature there TDC U which is
296659	basically a configurable like
298490	intelligent way of controlling your lift
300620	distance and making sure that it doesn't
302120	just shift all over the place
303770	unnecessarily when you're trying to lift
306409	the mouse up when you reach the end of
307819	the mousepad and yeah that's good get a
311360	good shot of me like cheating on my
313159	rocket achievements right so there's a
315800	there's an app that tracks your usage of
317960	the mouse and allows you to get
319819	achievements like sultan of scroll if
321860	you scroll a lot and sort of cool stuff
323659	like that and I think that's pretty much
325189	it that lighting effect looks really
329810	good so you can see there's four LEDs
331580	one here here here and here and those
333680	are multicolored LEDs systems so you can
336080	actually have colors blend together in
338180	the middle or you can just do solid
340069	colors the way that we have it
341449	configured right now I want to just
342949	boost up the it's much brighter than it
344750	looks in the camera oh oh that's shutter
347839	speed okay why don't you do its like
352180	there you go boost up the okay that's
355159	more like true to life now it's quite
357589	bright I think that pretty much wraps it
360169	up thank you for checking out this
