6770	welcome to my unboxing of the a zo k
10230	b-17 8rt mini thumb keyboard so as you
14370	guys may or may not know if you've
15839	watched a few my videos I'm kind of a
17880	fan of keyboards and mice and pointing
21270	devices that make life easier with
23430	immediacy because I'm one of these seven
25410	people in the world who actually has one
27800	so actually no there's more than seven
31650	but you know so okay so let's have a
33840	look at this guy
34590	compact form factor designed
36180	specifically for home theater pcs easy
38010	navigation using the built-in optical
39510	trackball now that's cool
40980	eight dedicated multimedia hotkeys
42840	including all the ones you can see here
44489	you can read them if you really care 2.4
46410	gigahertz RF technology provides up to
48149	30 feet and wireless range that's not
49739	bad because I have actually run into
51960	products that I haven't been able to get
53670	to work properly from the couch which is
55079	ridiculous okay so rechargeable
57719	batteries included awesome scissor key
60180	caps architecture makes typing silent
61739	stable uncomfortable scissor keys are
64319	not necessarily the most durable but as
66420	they pointed out they are very quiet so
68369	there's that going for it compatible
69960	with Windows 7 comes with a mini USB
71430	dongle built-in trackball with
72840	left-handed mouse buttons and let's open
75659	this bad boy up oh it's actually smaller
77189	than I thought when I saw the size of
78869	the box I thought I was gonna be like oh
80220	how am I gonna reach the middle keys but
81630	it's actually much much smaller than
84150	that slacker meets the middle keys just
85950	fine cool okay so here we go oh no way
92090	it comes with actual rechargeable nickel
97530	metal hydride batteries look at that
101750	like you know how normally when
104369	something says comes with rechargeable
105869	battery I was even thinking I was like
107759	oh well what about when the battery runs
109170	out what am I gonna do with like some
111000	proprietary internal battery keyboard
112860	I'm not gonna be able to use my computer
113850	no way comes with rechargeable triple
116820	A's BAM I just got damned by Ezio
119490	because they were all like yeah we
121560	thought of that huh cool ok comes with
125009	wow they weren't kidding when they said
126390	I like mini USB receiver they get that
129660	stuck in the port no you kiddin but
132300	okay and then there's your charging
134590	cable so that's pretty cool so you plug
137080	that into a new USB port you plug that
138610	into one of your other USB ports you
140620	throw these guys into the keyboard
142630	itself so let's go ahead and do that now
144780	okay you got your pairing button you got
146860	your on/off button you can turn it off
148390	if you don't want to waste your battery
149880	let's go ahead and see if we can get
154390	that in there yeah okay so there it is
157239	so let's have a look at what we think of
158650	the overall overall build - this guy
160630	so can we type on it with our fingers
163360	not really okay so when they call it a
165400	thumb keyboard they really do mean it
166690	the spacebar
167530	even with my smallish hands so guys bear
169360	in mind my hands are not very big here
170739	Slick's hand for for context see that's
174040	the size of my hand compare just like
175299	that so they're safe okay so remember
177340	that so even with my small hands I can
179650	easily reach the spacebar with both with
181900	both hands okay so my home row keys are
184510	where are they yeah they're here and
186400	here right yeah my home row keys are not
188470	quite centered it's a bit of a pet peeve
190510	for me personally for thumb keyboards I
192190	wish it was a little bit over here but
193810	they're not as far off as the one that
195519	I'm using now which really bugs me
197260	because it's like not even close so it's
198670	like over here like something stupid
200230	like that
202260	okay so home row keys are fairly easy to
204940	reach as well I can reach escape I can
206980	reach backspace very easily enters here
209079	one shift key I wouldn't have minded
211359	seeing two shift keys that would have
212950	been better if there's one over here but
214209	I can see why they made that change
216459	because they had to put in the arrow
218019	keys they had to put them somewhere and
219940	I don't really see what other options
221470	they have because what else is cool
222940	about this is check this out it has
224019	almost everything it's got your caps
225609	lock it's got this haven't no it doesn't
228069	have a number pad but it's got your f8
229780	keys they're all built in with a
230920	function key it's got like dedicated
233650	bracket keys so you can type almost
235389	anything with this thing without any
236709	challenges you've also got a battery
238510	life indicator and something about
241540	rechargeable batteries so I don't know
242950	what that would actually indicate but
244930	then you've got a bunch of media buttons
246280	as well and here are your left and right
248260	click buttons so this is an optical
249730	trackball let's find out how well it
250870	works so yeah that's just let's see how
254410	quickly we can get it going out of the
256298	box ok so plug the thing into the thing
259738	make sure my hold on don't worry at the
261880	computer yet I need to make
263010	I don't have anything inappropriate up
264780	on my speed okay that we're good and
267980	installing device driver USB composite
271620	device RF dongle I'm gonna stand over
274560	here so that I'm kind of under the light
276030	so you guys can see the keyboard
277050	somewhat searching Windows Update I'm
280110	gonna press the pairing thing now to see
281700	if that does anything it's kind of
282780	recessed tough to press actually oh yeah
286640	when in doubt just use a knife okay
292110	so the claims it's ready to use on the
294660	computer side anyway so let's press the
298820	home button
300390	what's the home button gonna do okay
301890	maybe I should actually open something
303360	and try to type let's see if it's
305940	working yet nope not yet okay ooo I
310410	didn't turn it on haha okay let's bring
313260	back the knife see this is the kind of
315420	stuff that goes on off-camera sometimes
317310	so I'm being very brave when I actually
318810	work on things on camera with you people
320700	because as you can clearly see I'm not
323370	actually that good at using computer
325080	stuff there we go
327120	it's working okay so let's take like
332300	hello world Hey
337080	oh did I accidentally hit the out I did
339840	shoot I accidentally hit the eye okay
341340	come back face hello world very usable
345360	so if you just want to Google something
346590	or whatever else then that's qu and
349440	let's oh let's try the trackball okay
351990	hey that's actually not that hard to use
353940	check this out so I'm gonna go and I'm
356100	gonna save this particular document and
358530	I'm gonna put it in my Starcraft 2
360840	folder because that makes a lot of sense
362790	go ahead there this is very very usable
367170	cool okay so that's the idea of thumb
369240	keyboard thank you for checking out my
370800	unboxing your first look and don't
