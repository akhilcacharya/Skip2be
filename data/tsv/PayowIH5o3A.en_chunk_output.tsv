7040	welcome to my unboxing and first look at
9540	what Mad Catz claims is the most
12660	adjustable gaming keyboard ever created
15660	ever this is the u.s. QWERTY layout 1
18090	which makes sense because I'm in North
19410	America
20100	Oh oh it has a built-in Oh LED screen
23250	and the backlight can be changed to
27869	pretty much any color you can imagine so
29519	there's RGB LED lighting behind it
31650	giving you 60 million possible backlight
33989	colors which is very cool something we
35640	really haven't seen that much we've seen
36989	some keyboards where you can change from
38489	between backlight colors but they'll
40050	usually just have a few options now we
41910	finally have a fully backlit gaming
43890	keyboard that can be whatever color you
45180	want so it's customizable it is has
48329	color o LED okay so that's for the
50309	screen right there that kind of shows
51480	cool stuff about what you're adjusting
53430	or whatever else command module setup
56190	reduces the footprint and provides 21
59039	programmable buttons 3 profile modes
61500	media keys and a Windows key lock so you
63660	can actually put the thing together for
65820	to build what is to say basically your
68760	own kind of Belkin Nostromo type thing
70830	if you guys remember that thing ok ok
74790	just another picture of it ah yes so
77400	here's a little bit more information
78479	about what can be displayed on the
80610	screen so the multiple i gaining at the
83840	Woomer gaming app something ok yeah it's
87119	a different language that's cool so
88650	basically it just shows you what's going
90810	on at any given time so your program
92970	launcher right there see battlefield is
94920	the launching indicator mic volume
96960	countdown timer stopwatch clock
98310	brightness and volume can all show up on
100290	there very cool stuff so let's go ahead
101939	and open it up and we'll be back a
102960	moment sorry guys we were trying to open
105210	it we realize there's more information
106229	on the back so the modular components
108000	adapt to your game space and playing
109350	style just like their rat series mice
111000	okay the it has a full RGB backlight
114240	okay we've talked about that 21 program
115740	will knock four keys in three modes okay
117030	we talked about that height adjustable
118920	active palm rest features additional
121140	thumb wheel and button for even more
122969	controls at your fingertips so that is
125850	right there we'll find that after I
127710	panel innovative full-color LED screen
129989	which is there and pass through headset
132319	are passed through for headset and
134719	microphone port so that's a very handy
136790	as well so we'll have a look at that
137870	once we get this video open down so the
147590	whole thing comes out of the box in like
149900	kind of a tower like this the first
152060	layer contains the main part of the
154459	keyboard where you actually do your
155870	typing you know you're writing letters
158659	to Grandma or whatever else so this is
161060	just your letters and your shifts and
163189	your back spaces and you oh that's not
165409	bad they're using a very unique key
166909	technology with this keyboard that
168620	actually it's supposed to feel more like
170989	mechanical even though it is using
173000	membrane key switches and I'd say it is
175159	better there is more tactile feedback
177919	but it's still very quiet with the only
182120	notable exception being the spacebar the
184430	next piece contains your number pad as
189230	well as your delete and insert keys page
191659	up page down your arrow keys and all
193939	that stuff that you may or may not have
195889	any need for and you can decide whether
198470	you even want to attach it to the main
200659	keyboard itself and later next you've
205970	got the module that goes up at the top
208370	that has the O LED display as well as
211489	your media keys and a bunch of
213259	programmable macro keys that you can
214909	switch which mode you're using by using
218389	the buttons that are probably located on
220849	something we haven't seen yet cables
225849	which again will figure out how all that
228560	works in a moment more cables which will
230659	figure out how all that works in a
231769	moment and finally your wrist rest this
241879	piece that allows you to switch between
243290	the various modes so you can go from
246079	pick from one of three profiles for your
248269	macro please your manual Allah oh wow
256728	and allen key to put the whole thing
258199	together as well as the screws you need
259608	and finally two more pieces of what will
264229	be the rest
265130	rest for the main part of the keyboard
269020	now you have the option of putting it
271820	together with screws but if you change
273980	it around all the time I guess you don't
275420	even have to because everything clips
277010	into place so I'm going to show you guys
278750	this configuration before I show you the
280880	more standard configuration so we got it
282770	in two pieces so you got your keyboard
284750	here which just has all your standard
287270	functionality on it so there's nothing
288890	bad exceptional about it except that you
291410	can completely adjust the wrist rest for
293120	the length of your hands so you can see
295100	I'd be quite uncomfortable like this
296690	however I can move it in one step or I
302090	can move it in one more additional step
303980	in order to get closer which is probably
305840	where I would end up then you've got
308540	these huh see these interchangeable
311390	things right here that you can use to
314000	plug it in however you need to so I've
315620	used the cables that I need however you
317810	can see I have an extra left over this
319460	would be for if I assemble it the other
320930	way you can adjust the height of it just
323930	by pulling these down and it has lots of
325790	rubber grippy feet on the bottom making
327800	it so it's not going to slip anywhere
329270	pretty much no matter what you do to it
331930	now this piece so I've assembled this
335330	using the O LED display so the way you
337340	use this is you can select the
338780	functionality using the up and down you
340700	can use the right arrow to activate
342440	things you can use left arrow to go back
344300	I believe I'm not okay I can't remember
347060	what the left arrow does but basically
348440	these four buttons are for functioning
350840	the display and the dial around the top
352850	allows you to change whatever is on the
354500	display so if you're using the
355460	application launcher you can change
357230	which application you're going to launch
358460	if you're using the volume control then
360230	you can adjust in increments of five and
362330	then if you want more fine adjustment
364490	then you can use the buttons on the side
365750	your media controls are here your play
367790	your stop your mute your left your are
369500	your left your right your your back your
371510	forward and then these up here are all
373610	programmable keys now I was wrong before
376040	I said that these were for the different
378260	profiles they are not the profiles are
380750	selected up here one two and three
382610	here's a Windows on an off key as well
384380	as control for the backlight on the
385820	keyboard these guys right here are
387680	additional programmable buttons you can
389600	see that they have normal functionality
391400	control shift enter and backspace but
394490	you don't have to use them that way
396470	this
398460	is a rolling wheel so you can use that
401850	with your thumb this is an additional
403500	programmable button and then all these
405270	mbot RC buttons rather around here are
407729	also programmable so this is that you
410550	can create yourself a little sort of
412830	gaming pad and you can adjust however
414690	you want to use it it's totally totally
416520	up to you more adjustments here so you
419190	can change the length L and you can also
421169	increase the height of it if you want so
424169	very cool stuff there's that
425250	pass-through for the headphone and
427259	microphone ports on the back here and
428910	you can see again how I've assembled it
430800	using little wires and cables and
433289	whatnot going where it needs to go so
435000	there you go you can move as far away as
436470	you want to you can use ER peas like
437910	this or if you have smaller hands then
439860	you can move it up closer whatever you
441720	want to do is totally up to you so we're
444090	going to put it together the other way
445229	and show you how that works
494280	and we are assembled now so I hope you
497919	guys enjoyed the assembly process
499330	actually doesn't take that long and this
502150	was my first time doing it so you guys
503740	could see I got a little bit confused
505150	there for a while so now this is in
507490	position to use your more typical WASD
510310	gaming configuration this has been moved
513640	over so that the the strike 5 wrist rest
516789	is here everything is still very
517929	adjustable so you can change everything
520208	to your heart's content and your layout
523270	is more like when you'd what you'd see
525160	on a normal keyboard so there you have
527680	it I hope you guys have enjoyed my
530230	unboxing and first look at the strike 5
532450	from Mad Catz
533649	don't forget to subscribe - tech tips
535390	from unboxings reviews and other
536560	computer videos and before we wrap this
539050	up I should say guys um I'm actually
542470	pretty impressed by what they've done
544060	with the membrane keys here are the
545649	mechanical keys no but are they your
548649	typical membrane keys no there is a lot
551470	of difference between one membrane key
553060	and another for example the
554140	first-generation Logitech G 15 had
556120	significantly better membrane keys than
558250	any further gen 2g whatever anything
561790	that's followed it so there is a huge
564040	difference from one membrane key cap to
565630	another one and this one definitely
566680	achieves that I'd love for you guys to
568660	post a comment under the video let me
569950	know what do you think of this whole
571300	modular peripheral concept we've seen it
574330	with the rat series now we see it with
575740	the strike series what do you guys think
