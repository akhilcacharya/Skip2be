30	thank you daddy Brandt for sponsoring
1319	our CES 2018 content check out their six
3810	skins in the description down below
5819	we're here at main gear checking out
7230	their f1 31 gaming desktop as you can
10260	see just on the inside through the
12030	tempered glass panel we have an m-80 X
14730	from other board so you can have up to
15870	four sticks of RAM which is cool they
17520	didn't go with a tiny ITX board and they
19980	did manage to mount two graphics cards
21689	in here it's a little hard to tell but
23580	you can see just in the back they have
25289	another GTX 10 atti also while the
28439	cameras up here you'll notice that they
29699	have case lighting on the inside all
31679	around and on the front for the logo and
34530	that is all able to be controlled
36300	through either your motherboard with
37920	something like a soos aura or through
40079	the controller that comes in the box the
42030	internals are constructed out of server
44010	grade steel and the outside is Japanese
47160	brushed aluminum but if you do want to
49140	spice it up a little bit they do have
51270	multiple other finishes as well you can
53039	get their spectrum paint with chameleon
55320	colors or their mark to finish or many
58050	more as well but to bring us back to the
60600	inside of the case you have a power
62129	supply shroud which nicely hides your
64110	power supply and the cables that come
66659	with it and on top of that you can mount
68580	up to three SSDs a lot of those SSDs
71130	look amazing you might not have an
73110	awesome M to drive like they have here
75240	or you might just want more in general
76710	so you can show those off but you won't
79350	be able to see that if what you're
81240	covering it up with looks even way
83070	better and is called apex ICS that's the
86009	cooling system that we have here that is
88110	made custom for this case you can have
90479	whatever coolant color in it you want
92040	we're showing red here but they also
93600	have other colors here as well and it is
95790	cooled by a giant 3 by 140 millimeter
99509	radiator in the top up to I should say
101460	you can put whatever radiator up in the
102930	top you want you can pair the apex ICS
106049	with Softline tubing or like they're
107820	displaying here on all of their systems
109229	and as I would expect from main gear
111630	hardline tubing it has dual pumps in the
114060	back which is great because you can run
115470	each one of them at a slightly lower
117000	rate than you normally would and it'll
118890	still operate great and it's really
120750	really quiet I can't even hear it
122219	standing right here which is awesome
123750	there's a flow rate meter like you can
125399	see right in the front there's a
127409	pressure release valve for fast draining
129090	through a quick disconnect port and a
131038	temp sensor to make sure that everything
132540	is going okay
133690	and an LED strip down the right-hand
135670	side which will look especially good if
137590	you run a complete UV setup and it's
141130	available now you can configure your
142960	personal f1 31 gaming chassis setup with
146590	Apex ICS cooling at main gears website
