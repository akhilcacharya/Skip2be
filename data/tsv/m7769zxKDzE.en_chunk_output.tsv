0	this video is brought to you by our
1890	trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
5430	to my unboxing and first look at the
7379	Corsair Vengeance M 95 so there's
9780	actually a couple of different colors
11130	available black and white so the black
13620	one is old the white one is new other
15780	than a few key changes in terms of the
19470	hardware inside the mouse not a lot is
22560	different from the Vengeance M 90 so if
24359	you already like the M 90 or if you
25949	already have an M 90 this might not be a
28439	reason to run out and grab another one
29970	but if you aren't already using a
32009	Corsair Gaming Mouse then this might be
34050	a reason to give it a closer look
35820	because they have modernized the feature
37469	somewhat and I think it's kind of cool
39510	that you can get it in different colors
41160	because there's not many companies out
42570	there that offer a wide variety of
45149	different colors not that I'm saying
46469	black and white is necessarily a wide
48149	variety but it's a variety so there you
52620	had it I guess a little more some of the
54960	more gaming oriented guys too okay well
57600	there you go so the finish is actually
59730	different on the white one versus the
61739	black one so I'm going to open up both
63210	of them they come with a 2-year warranty
64700	rather than the older Mouse which had a
67619	lower sensitivity sensor they now
69570	feature in Avago a D&amp;S 9800 sensor which
73229	goes it up to 8200 dpi now that's not to
77580	say that very many people are actually
79920	going to get a tangible benefit from an
82350	8200 dpi Gaming Mouse because most
84509	people won't unless you're running
86070	multi-monitor setups and you need to get
88200	from you know one side to the other with
91079	a small flick of your wrist you're
92939	probably going to turn the dpi down it
94860	just happens that the higher-end sensors
97110	that have all those features like being
99299	able to adjust your lift distance and
101430	you know automatically detecting the
103799	surface that they're running on and
105299	making adjustments and all those kinds
106799	of good things like just working well on
108420	anything they just happen to be high DPI
110820	sensors these days because high-end
113040	sensors have high-end features and have
114720	high DPI so that it's easier to sell
116490	them alright so the finish is actually
118320	quite different this one is a matte soft
121170	touch finish on the top so that's the
122969	black model with a grippy side that has
125250	kind of a like a very fine grit
127439	sandpaper feel to it so that you're
129300	going to be able to lift the mouse
130889	without and same thing here on these
133080	buttons
133710	have a little bit of texture to them so
135630	you're going to be able to lift the
136830	mouse without accidentally pressing the
138870	buttons and you can also put a little
139980	bit of pressure here so just like that
141900	that gives you that that grip that you
143550	need the white model has more leg cut so
146220	it's got the same sort of grip enos here
148080	and it's got the same texture here so
152460	you can actually hear that texture but
154080	the top of the mouse is completely
155850	smooth kind of like a stormtrooper armor
157860	like finish it'll go really well with
159210	something like a 600 T white edition
162360	case for example so I'm going to focus
164370	on the white one just because the black
165870	one is very similar to the one that
167220	we've seen before so right here we've
169140	got a poly floor ofö tetryl whatever it
172020	is so Teflon trademark TM can't use that
174900	word pads on the bottom that allow it to
177300	glide around on any surface wouldn't
179280	mind it seeing these ones be a little
180660	bit bigger but a great amount of the
182970	bottom of the mouse is actually covered
185190	so they shouldn't wear out too quickly
186420	one difference between the m95 and the
189270	m65 is that the m95 doesn't have weight
191850	adjustment so it is a bit of a heavier
194790	Mouse and you can't really take any of
196590	the weight off of it but I personally
198750	think that the benefit of the m95
200430	outweighs any disadvantage it has
202410	against the m65 because I love having
204840	access to all of these extra buttons
206340	here so you've got six seven eight nine
208890	buttons on the side that you can reach
210930	with your thumb I personally can
212910	probably only reach about this one this
214980	one this one this one this one this one
216840	this one so I can probably only reach
218340	about seven of them myself but if you
220350	had larger hands like one of our
222210	assistants here you can step in so
224400	that's slicks slicks mitts you can
227010	probably reach all the buttons on the
228540	side fairly easily there you go and
230010	that's probably more of a claw Mouse for
231270	you anyway
231900	I don't it's there a mouse that you can
233550	pump this Kate we'll talk about that
234840	later there's also two more buttons up
237210	here these ones are configured to back
238710	and forward by default so you can go
240840	back and forward in your browser or
242010	whatever else moving up to the top of
243660	the mouse we find what our doing by
245370	default configured as back and forward
247110	buttons as well as a dpi switcher here
249000	that has an LED indicator on the side of
250920	the mouse that tells you exactly which
252420	profile you happen to be in of course
254430	you've got your left and right click as
256048	well as a middle button click giving you
258329	a ton of different functionality that
261120	you can access quickly and easily on the
263910	m95 now they've also added second
266820	generation
267420	Corsair software support to these mice
270740	early on with the m9d and the m60 there
273930	were some complaints about the software
275430	in general they've actually made a lot
277140	of changes to it so if you have an M 90
279120	or an m60 on the Shelf right now then go
282540	ahead and sort of pull it out see what
284250	you think of it if you don't have one
285780	then you can with a lot more confidence
287850	go ahead and check out the M 65 or the
290100	m95 depending on which gaming style you
292050	want this chord is about six feet long
293700	so you can probably approximately see
295650	how long it is like that or about one
297990	Linus wingspan plus about six inches or
300330	about fifteen centimeters and I think
302580	that pretty much wraps it up so thank
304170	you for checking out my unboxing and
305520	first look at the courser m95 don't
