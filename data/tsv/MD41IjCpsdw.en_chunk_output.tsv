89	when I first started working with Linus
1860	in 2011 that dates this whole thing a
4950	little bit I'm a little old I was a
6899	major keyboard fan boy if you check out
8880	this video Linus shows off my old
10590	mineral oil rig a big part of the reason
12450	I got the job
13170	I'm literally working right now in that
15480	video he shows off a customized keyboard
17910	that I had loved actually I still love
21000	it and it's still my daily driver I
22619	recently made a video fixing it which
24630	can be found up here as well since then
27119	however the whole computer hardware
28830	industry has gone absolutely insane over
32488	keyboards the number of new keyboards on
34739	the market is nuts and it's more than a
38070	little bit confusing and overwhelming
39930	for instance newegg.com
42210	has twelve hundred and twenty products
45360	listed under gaming keyboards oh my god
48780	and there's only so many times you can
50879	make a video on a keyboard that has
52860	willed yes Cherry MX switches most
55289	likely in the brown or red variety and
57420	some form of backlighting but just in
60690	case you do happen to miss those I've
62969	got two of them here today the G 610
65610	Orion with Cherry MX brown switches and
68250	the G 610 Orion with cherry MX red
71790	switches or if your tastes are a little
73830	more Japanese than German we have the G
76350	810 Oh Ryan spectrum a fully RGB
79229	keyboard that features Romer G switches
81360	and its little spunky brother the ten
83549	keyless g4 ten Atlas spectrum featuring
86460	full RGB and romaji switches with all of
89610	that out of the way let's check out some
91229	keyboards shall we
100650	let's start with the most interesting
102790	keyboard that would probably be the g8
104710	ten Oh Ryan spectrum back in 2014
107619	lioness made a video about the G 910 and
110440	had a lot to say about the Romer G
112330	switches a lot of his messaging which I
114369	actually completely agree with as him
117580	pointing out things like the shorter
119320	more gaming oriented actuation distance
121540	and the raw performance of the switch
124090	itself both of which are absolutely
127299	awesome he also points out that the
130030	feeling may not quite be as satisfying
133120	as a Cherry MX which due to the mushy
136080	compression feeling of bottoming them
138220	out that last point is something I would
140110	like to address while I completely agree
142300	that they feel mushy to bottom out and
144519	I'm definitely someone who bottoms out
147040	his keys if you force yourself to not
150160	bottom the switches out and just press
153040	them to slightly beyond the actuation
156250	point which is technically as far as you
158170	need to go and is technically the best
159880	way to do it they actually feel pretty
162820	great super responsive sweeper fast
165340	wonderful switches not for me personally
167620	because I slam my fingers down and
169720	bottom out keys like a dummy but if you
172450	can control your key presses better and
175329	half press this may be great for you
178510	the biggest complaint linus had and one
180850	of the biggest complaints the community
182739	as a whole had was their key caps they
186280	did some super weird stuff with those
187900	but as the problem is solved on the g
190359	810 i won't focus on it anymore i'll
192640	just leave it with the problem is solved
195310	how did they do this well they use
196930	standard style key caps that's it
200079	thanks for being humble logitech that
201609	was exactly what people wanted and you
203620	delivered that's all there is to say
205239	besides all that it features 26 key
207910	rollover which should be more than
209260	enough for anyone other than that one
211720	dude who finds it really entertaining to
214090	see how many inputs he can have when he
216519	tries to attempt typing on the keyboard
218590	with his entire butt but it's probably
220930	fine it also features three step angle
223299	adjustment for your varying keyboard
224950	angle and height needs five large rubber
227800	feet on the bottom to keep it from
229330	sliding around some rather controversial
231459	media
232330	roll buttons because they're circles not
234310	squares I personally don't really care
237730	but have seen a number of comments about
239770	them so just be aware of that
241660	my biggest remark on the media Keys is
244030	that they feel actually pretty great to
245830	press their super tactile and responsive
248320	making them feel kind of like the keys
250360	you expect to feel on a receiver which
252880	is kind of cool considering their media
254440	functions the build quality is great
256570	with what must be some form of metal
258790	plate running through the body making it
260500	feel very sturdy and solid and it comes
263560	with the Logitech Gaming software that
265840	you were probably expecting for me to
267580	bring up like right now which allows you
269830	to intricately macro bind different keys
272920	on your keyboard mainly the F keys a
275020	lovely light control which I must say it
277660	looks awesome on these keyboards because
279190	of the romaji light stem it looks very
280900	nice and diffused and whatnot
282280	customizable gaming mode button and a
284380	key press heat map which is actually
286870	super cool I like that kind of stuff the
288730	only thing really lacking from this
290110	keyboard in my opinion is an included
292360	wrist rest most of its competitors have
294850	one it feels a bit lacking in that
296620	department I know the previous wrist
299020	rest wasn't winning a ton of awards
300730	people didn't like the gaming only half
302890	of it really being their style but they
304960	could have included something the G 410
307630	atlas spectrum despite its name is in a
310510	smaller ten keyless package but other
313090	than that is is much of the same it
315310	doesn't seem to contain a metal plate
317169	and feels kind of flimsy and light which
319300	I wasn't a fan of largely again because
321880	I bought him out keys like a dummy so I
324100	don't know if that means much to you the
325630	awesome lighting the romaji switches the
327850	more standardized key caps all of those
329620	were there and it does include a wrist
331540	rest but it's the gaming wrist rest that
334000	the G 9/10 had so you may not be super
337030	interested in that or you will that's
339190	fine too
339729	the other two keyboards both bearing the
341470	name g6 10 Orion are basically the g8 10
344950	but with only backlighting for white
346840	colors cherry brown and cherry red MX
349600	switches respectively and that's about
352060	all there is to say about them which
353470	isn't necessarily a bad thing it's fine
355780	it just kind of feels like eating a taco
357760	versus nachos and seven-layer dip
360040	lots of the same ingredients but
362110	oriented in a slightly different way
364240	creating a different
366490	so there that's the current state of
368680	logitech keyboards hopefully knowledge
370840	on these four gives you a better grasp
373150	on the apparently twelve hundred and
375280	twenty currently available keyboards
