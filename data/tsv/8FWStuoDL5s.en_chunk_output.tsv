13590	welcome to my unboxing of the KB 460
16500	from funk this is a brand you haven't
18480	seen featured much on the channel and
20279	the reason for that is that they just
21900	don't really have that many products up
23490	till now so the MS 3 is their gaming
26160	mouse that I really feel is quite
27840	optimal for people with larger hands and
29910	both diesel and b-roll actually use them
33000	day-to-day at their editing stations and
34770	this is the follow up the KB for 60
37710	so first up inside we find a product
39329	manual next inside we find a couple of
42540	little presumably feet or something
44820	we'll find out what those are for later
45960	and we've also got some nice closed cell
48989	foam packing material and I decide on
51239	what is a fairly sturdy feeling Cherry
57030	MX red backlit mechanical keyboard once
61589	we get the keyboard extracted from the
63239	box we find a design that is actually
65850	kind of both subdued and striking
68370	looking so the backplane itself has a
70470	matte soft touch feel that looks very
72990	professional and very clean and then the
75390	keys themselves are individually LED
77820	backlit with red LEDs and to augment the
81000	LED shine there's actually a red layer
83640	underneath all of the keys that is
85409	easily visible when the keyboard is not
87899	powered on see there you see that so
89729	that the LEDs shine off of that as well
91799	making the lighting even more striking
94439	the cable has the standard func black
97409	and orange finish to it is actually
99360	quite a thin cable which it makes sense
101070	because it terminates in a single
102869	connector on the other end so it should
104700	be borne in mind that these two USB 2.0
107549	ports are non powered ports so you won't
110189	be able to plug in like the most you
111899	know power-hungry like you know you know
113939	white and a fan that for your desk or
116429	anything like that you meant to plug in
118079	your mouse and maybe a USB Drive or
119579	something along those lines the layout
121560	has nothing about it that I would
124170	complain about which is a definite plus
126090	because there's usually something for me
128008	to gripe about when it comes to keyboard
129508	layouts long shift keys long backspace
131880	long enter media keys built in as well
134850	as built in profile keys so you can
137760	actually reprogram any of the keys on
139740	the keyboard and then switch between the
141180	profiles using f7 to f11 along with the
145379	function key next to the
146890	profile keys there's also the funk mode
149110	key which does a couple of things so
151030	number one is that it illuminates the
153220	funk mode button no no it does more than
156100	that don't worry it also disables the
157720	Windows key and allows all of these
160150	function keys to be accessed without
161709	holding function so you can switch
163600	between profiles on-the-fly
164860	it has built-in memory so there's
166690	absolutely no driver installation
168490	required and the keyboard also supports
171070	full and key rollover on it's cherry MX
174340	red switches now Cherry MX red switches
176620	are one of those hotly debated items
179020	gamers will run around saying they're
181060	the best thing since sliced bread
182260	because they're extremely light making
184090	them great for fast repeated pressing
186910	whereas typists will run around saying
188920	well no I can't type on anything but
190540	blues and anything but blues is terrible
192550	you know what there's probably a middle
194050	ground somewhere here but there it is
196390	it comes with cherry MX red switches and
198370	given that it is a product that is
199690	marketed towards gamers that makes a
201640	fair bit of sense the last thing of note
203739	here is those little clips that I had in
205780	the box before so those go down here and
207940	then you actually clip the wrist rest
209620	onto them that gives you a fair bit of
212320	flexibility in terms of the range of
213970	motion of your wrist rest and a system
216489	that looks like it'll come off as
218230	opposed to breaking this is something
220209	I'm happy to see included I'm seeing
221680	more and more manufacturers just
223180	flat-out cheap out and not include wrist
225579	rests and funk has gone and included a
227230	nice a wide one that spans the entire
229480	width of the keyboard kudos to them for
231760	that so if I had to summarize the KB for
234070	60 in some way the highest praise I can
236829	give it I think is that I have nothing
238420	to complain about I'm personally not a
241450	huge fan of Cherry MX red switches so
243400	it's not really made for me personally
245230	but other than that there's nothing
248320	wrong with it it's driverless it has all
251079	the function keys that you might want
252400	it's solidly built no complaints and
257380	when it comes to keyboards if there's
259060	not something that's driving you crazy
260140	about it it's probably just as well that
261789	it gets out of your way and you have
262900	nothing to complain about with it thank
