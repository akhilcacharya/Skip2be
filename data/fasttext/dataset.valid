__label__0 suggested to me by twitter user at the
__label__0 Boomer so big thanks to them if you have
__label__0 an idea for a video tweet it at me and
__label__0 if I use it I'll credit you and be
__label__0 eternally grateful thank you for
__label__0 watching and I'll see you in two weeks
__label__0 for another one over productions video

__label__1 accounting solution for freelancers and
__label__1 small business owners check it out at
__label__1 the link in the video description so
__label__0 we're here at the Sony booth where they
__label__0 are showing off the next evolution in
__label__0 their short throw 4k laser projector
__label__0 technology this one differs from
__label__0 previous iterations in that it is a
__label__0 little bit more furniture like in its
__label__0 implementation so instead of just
__label__0 containing a 4k laser projector it also
__label__0 has a built in shelf and maybe the
__label__0 powers coming back on now nope they were
__label__0 just informing us that there is a power
__label__0 outage we noticed thank you sorry for
__label__0 that so in a nutshell it is a more
__label__0 complete package than ever before and
__label__0 that's why it actually costs more so
__label__0 while the last generation had a couple
__label__0 of cabinets and speakers this one has a
__label__0 shelf which is cool because you can put
__label__0 your xbox excuse me your your
__label__0 PlayStation down there and it also has
__label__0 three excuse me five speakers and a
__label__0 subwoofer so there's two tweeters using
__label__0 Sony's advanced vertical drive so
__label__0 they're actually glass and they radiate
__label__0 sound in all directions and there are
__label__0 three mid-range speakers built into the
__label__0 chassis with one of them actually firing
__label__0 out the back that acts as a centre
__label__0 speaker so it's it's pointed at the wall
__label__0 and then it bounces the sound towards
__label__0 the viewer the sub is actually the big
__label__0 thing that's kind of at the back near
__label__0 the bottom and from listening to it it's
__label__0 actually surprising how much sound
__label__0 they've managed to pack into this little
__label__0 package now let's talk about the image
__label__0 so it actually uses pretty similar tech
__label__0 to Sony's last generation solution so
__label__0 it's still a single laser DLP but that's
__label__0 without a spinning colour wheel so you
__label__0 shouldn't see any rainbow effect and it
__label__0 can handle a maximum image size of a
__label__0 hundred and
__label__0 20 inches at only nine and a half inches
__label__0 from the wall so that's actually pretty
__label__0 similar to what we're looking at right
__label__0 here it's 4k it's HDR it has a maximum
__label__0 luminance of 2500 lumens and they're
__label__0 planning to make it available in the US
__label__0 sometime this spring now it's gonna cost
__label__0 you a pretty penny at about $30,000 but
__label__0 if you think of it more in terms of like
__label__0 fancy furniture pricing and less in
__label__0 terms of firing a laser projected image
__label__0 at your wall pricing then maybe that
__label__0 starts to get a little bit more
__label__0 reasonable if you're into that sort of
__label__0 thing I mean you got your engineered
__label__0 marble top you got your design that I
__label__0 think subjectively looks pretty darn
__label__0 good and neutral so it should look great
__label__0 in pretty much any space that's that's
__label__0 real wood on the shelf there folks and
__label__1 you know what else is real the time you
__label__1 can save with fresh books fresh books is

__label__1 lets you save time and work more
__label__1 efficiently as a small business owner or

__label__0 next booth at least as long as the kinda
__label__0 have that at least as long as the
__label__0 battery for our light here doesn't you
__label__0 know go out I can't get the battery out
__label__0 I'm trying to show how dark it isn't
__label__0 here it's dark
__label__0 Sup you beautiful bastards!
__label__0 Hope you're having a fantastic
__label__0 Tuesday, Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it.
__label__1 And the first thing I want to talk about today because
__label__1 there's so much negativity in the news is a
__label__0 Positive story
__label__0 a positive story about my new personal hero Elizabeth Swaney.
__label__0 Elizabeth Swaney's a 33 year old American woman.
__label__0 She's been freestyle skiing since 2013. She's had the goal of making the Olympics.
__label__0 And this year she did just that, she went to the Olympics
__label__0 but you may not have heard of her because she finished
__label__0 24th (last place).  This in the women's ski halfpipe
__label__0 And as far as why she ended up in last place
__label__0 It was because she really didn't attempt any tricks.
__label__0 I can't show you the video for legal reasons
__label__0 but when she would get to the top of the halfpipe where people would normally do a trick she would just then go back down.
__label__0 For her two runs she receive the scores 30 and 31.4.
__label__0 I laughed because her best score was still 13.6 points behind 23rd place
__label__0 And that was Denmark's Laila Friis-Salling
__label__0 and she slipped on both runs. So the question becomes well
__label__0 Why did Elizabeth Swaney not do any tricks and how the hell is she in the Olympics?? Well my friends it is because Elizabeth
__label__0 Swaney is a damn American hero. A woman with the very American mindset of "It doesn't matter if I'm qualified to do it
__label__0 I'm gonna figure out a way how to get there!" Elizabeth knowing she didn't have a good chance of competing with the US team originally
__label__0 Competed for Venezuela where her mother is from later switching to Hungary where her grandparents were from.
__label__0 She actually ended up becoming Hungary's first
__label__0 Olympic freestyle skier after qualifying both through the country's quota system as well as placing where she needed to place
__label__0 among 13 World Cup halfpipe contests.
__label__0 Now when you hear that she placed where she needed to place you go, oh okay,
__label__0 Well, she beat out other athletes. Not really, pretty much every event she went to she placed last or near last.
__label__0 But Elizabeth realized she could game the system. According to the rules, to qualify for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games
__label__0 athletes must record a number of top 30 finishes.
__label__0 And so what Swaney ended up doing was just going to competitions with fewer than 30 competitors!
__label__0 And so by technicality she was satisfying the requirements.
__label__0  McDonalds is everywhere. In the continental United States, the most mumbled from the MD may be
__label__0  at this place in the National Shelter Archive for Shelton in Nevada. Even then you have to travel
__label__0  only 115 miles (185 km) to the nearest wings. There are more than 36,000 in the world
__label__0  places in 119 different countries. One of McDonalds' defining features
__label__0  is the brand's permanence. While there are regional differences
__label__0  in the menu, such as Kiwi Burger in New Zealand or Chicken Kanji in Indonesia, the main menu
__label__0  such as Big Mac, Chicken Nuggets and Fried Potatoes have them everywhere. This means that
__label__0  the same things are done in the same way with the same products in very different ways
__label__0  economies around the world. Obviously, BigMaks do not have the same price everywhere. One BM
__label__0  it costs an average of $ 4.79 in the US, but if they take the equivalent in Kenya, 480
__label__0  shilling, no one will buy it because it's double the salary. Whatever
__label__0  to pay $ 200 for BM in the US. That's why McDonald's puts the price on it
__label__0  of burgers based on many factors such as labor, rent, product costs
__label__0  and local wages. Now a little true economy. Purchasing power is the number
__label__0  products that can be bought with a unit of currency. Let me explain. In the US the average price
__label__0  BM on all markets is $ 4.79. In Sweden, the BM price is 44 kronor.
__label__0  The 44 kroner is the equivalent of $ 5.13. This means that in the US you can get $ 1
__label__0  20.8% of BM, while in Sweden you can get only 19.5% of BM. According to BM
__label__0  the purchasing power of USD is higher. You can get more for the money
__label__0  yours. This also means that the Swedish krona is overestimated by about 6.1%
__label__0  at least according to the BigMac Index. The Economist magazine has done
__label__0  this index in 1986 as a fun way to compare buyer power between currencies. Let me now
__label__0  to see the numbers. In Venezuela, the cost of BigMac is $ 0.66 - that's it
__label__0  the cheapest BigMac in equivalent dollars in the world. That's because of
__label__0  rapid currency falls and high inflation in the country. It's waiting
__label__0  the price of the Venezuelan BM to jump in response. This means that with
__label__0  the money for one US BM can buy 7 Venezuelan. After Venezuela
__label__0  countries with the cheapest BigMac are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa and Malaysia.
__label__0  On the other hand, the most expensive BigMakers come from Switzerland
__label__0  Sweden, Norway, USA and Denmark. That's true, the US is home to the fourth most expensive
__label__0  BM in the world. It is also interesting to see for how long one
__label__0  one will get enough money for a BM in different cities around the world. In Nauru, Kenya
__label__0  the average worker must work 173 minutes to pay for a BM.
__label__0  Compare with Hong Kong, where you need to robotic only 8.7 min for
__label__0  burger. You can get a Burger in Miami where you have to
__label__0  you only work 10.7 min for BigMac. Tossy index is not
__label__0  perfect. While the cost of products is almost the same everywhere, because
__label__0  all products are one standard, the index does not see big differences
__label__0  in price of land and labor. A burger will cost less in India because McDonald's
__label__0  you do not have to pay much for place and workers. However, this index
__label__0  is a great way to learn a basic economy in a delicious way.
__label__0  I hope you liked the episode this week. Last week I showed the timing of Mars, which
__label__0  you can see here. If you like the videos, subscribe here. I also pray
__label__0  watch me at Twitter @WendoverPro. Thank you for watching and I will see you next Tuesday with
__label__0  More From This List In Wikipedia.
__label__1 thanks to synergy for sponsoring this
__label__1 video from CES 2018 synergy 2 is the
__label__1 easier way to connect one keyboard and
__label__1 mouse to multiple computers check it out
__label__1 at the link below so we're here in the
__label__0 Nvidia suite where they are showing off
__label__0 the world's first big big format sorry
__label__0 excuse me big format display they're
__label__0 bringing big screen gaming to the PC now
__label__0 gaming monitors that are big have
__label__0 already existed for quite some time
__label__0 and there are even PC monitors that are
__label__0 as large as 42 inches though it should
__label__0 be noted that there are only a few
__label__0 outliers that you could really consider
__label__0 to be gaming monitors that are 30 inches
__label__0 or above well that all changes today the
__label__0 65 inch monstrosity behind me checks off
__label__0 a ton of the boxes from our video
__label__0 earlier this year where we designed our
__label__0 ideal gaming TV so it's got really low
__label__0 latency like super low like a monitor
__label__0 it's got DisplayPort and HDMI input just
__label__0 like a monitor it's got a hundred and
__label__0 twenty Hertz max refresh rate just like
__label__0 a monitor and like a high-end gaming
__label__0 monitor it supports variable refresh
__label__0 rate with Nvidia g-sync technology so
__label__0 they're announcing three different
__label__0 models but all of them are using a VA
__label__0 panel from a you Optronics with quantum
__label__0 dot film four DCI p3 color support and
__label__0 nice deep black levels they're also
__label__0 using a full array back light solution
__label__0 with local dimming in order to achieve
__label__0 1000 nits peak brightness with the
__label__0 ability to support HDR now they haven't
__label__0 announced plans for Dolby vision at this
__label__0 time but it should be noted that most
__label__0 games maybe there's an exception or two
__label__0 you guys can leave a comment if you can
__label__0 think of anything but most games are
__label__0 supporting HDR through HDR 10 anyway
__label__0 let's talk results now they haven't
__label__0 announced how many local dimming zones
__label__0 these TVs have but if I had to guess I'd
__label__0 say it's probably similar to the 4k high
__label__0 refresh rate monitors that they talked
__label__0 about at CES last year so more than tens
__label__0 but probably not you know over a
__label__0 thousand something along those lines and
__label__0 in terms of results well local dimming
__label__0 is still not oled so that's a thing you
__label__0 can see blooms around bright objects in
__label__0 very dark scenes from time to time and
__label__0 it was especially noticeable in menus or
__label__0 if you have a bright moving light moving
__label__0 around your character like let's say
__label__0 like a navvy type assistant but if
__label__0 that's the case you've probably got more
__label__0 annoying things in your life and in
__label__0 general and fast paced situations we
__label__0 didn't really notice it while gaming now
__label__0 let's take a look at the back of a sirs
__label__0 prototype here these are absolutely
__label__0 prototypes so I guess the other thing to
__label__0 consider is that you've got to give them
__label__0 some time to improve it so they're
__label__0 announcing three partners Acer Asus and
__label__0 HP who are gonna launch displays
__label__0 hopefully sometime in the summer and
__label__0 it's up to those guys how they want to
__label__0 finish the screen matte or glossy how
__label__0 they want to do the stand the sound the
__label__0 bezel and the OSD options but in terms
__label__0 of the actual performance of the panel
__label__0 they're all using the same panel so it
__label__0 should be pretty similar okay then so I
__label__0 mean it's a TV realistically the
__label__0 expectation would be that you can use it
__label__0 for more than just gaming so Nvidia
__label__0 solution to that is to integrate a
__label__0 shield TV so they're full standalone
__label__0 device experience into the display and
__label__0 this is another thing that was in our
__label__0 video why don't you just have a high end
__label__0 thing built into the thing why are they
__label__0 why are they laggy it's ridiculous so
__label__0 Amazon and Netflix both have 4k HDR
__label__0 support and now you've got full
__label__0 integration with Google smart home and
__label__0 Google Voice which is pretty big and
__label__0 this is another announcement today that
__label__0 just like someone mentioned in passing I
__label__0 was like what really g-sync is now
__label__0 supported with game stream and in
__label__0 android games on shield TV though it
__label__0 should be noted you can't just plug your
__label__0 existing shield TV into your TV or your
__label__0 monitor because it only has HDMI out and
__label__0 gsync on the desktop anyway at this time
__label__0 is only supported over DisplayPort
__label__0 another cool thing for the TV guys not
__label__0 the gaming guys out there is video
__label__0 playback thanks to variable refresh rate
__label__0 is done at the native frame rate so if
__label__0 you're watching cinematic content it'll
__label__0 be running at 24 fps or if you're
__label__0 running something like the Grand Tour on
__label__0 Amazon then you will actually see it at
__label__0 the 25 fps that it was shot at No
__label__0 stupid interpolation no pulldown no
__label__0 nothing like that
__label__0 so let us know what you guys think in
__label__0 the comments is couch gaming finally
__label__0 here we've got low latency wireless mice
__label__0 we've got wireless keyboards we've got
__label__0 actual gaming TVs is it time well it's
__label__0 gonna depend on your budget like I said
__label__0 it's coming this summer and Nvidia is
__label__0 not commenting on pricing at all so I'm
__label__0 just gonna have to wildly speculate
__label__0 based on what I know about a typical
__label__0 g-sync up charge over a decent monitor
__label__0 and say I wouldn't expect these to be
__label__0 less than probably around 5 grand so let
__label__0 me know what you guys think you're gonna
__label__0 see and what you would pay at the
__label__0 comment section at the comment section
__label__0 damn it I was so close no let's just
__label__1 roll with that thanks to synergy for
__label__1 sponsoring this video synergy 2 makes
__label__1 the configuration of synergy their
__label__1 keyboard and mouse sharing software that
__label__1 works across Windows Linux and Mac
__label__1 easier than ever even with more
__label__1 complicated networking setups also
__label__1 improved with synergy 2 is the ability
__label__1 to have it running seamlessly in the
__label__1 background so you can set it and forget
__label__1 it
__label__1 so check it out at the link in the video
__label__1 description it's seamless comm slash
__label__1 synergy slash CES 2 you get 50% off down
__label__1 there by the way so thanks for watching
__label__0 guys if you dislike this video do that
__label__0 if you'd like to hit like if you really
__label__0 liked it then well you can't buy any of
__label__0 these yet so my standard outro is no

__label__1 30-day unrestricted trial go to
__label__1 FreshBooks com forward slash line of CES
__label__1 and enter - tech tips and the how did
__label__1 you hear about us section
__label__0 we're here at glowforge checking out
__label__0 their glowforge it's a laser etcher and
__label__0 cutter that is more set up and designed
__label__0 for everyone to be able to use instead
__label__0 of just engineers and the features that
__label__0 bring it to that point start with their
__label__0 easy web app where you can upload 3d
__label__0 grayscale images and raster or vector
__label__0 formats it can auto detect the material
__label__0 that you put inside if you use there
__label__0 proof grade materials if not you can
__label__0 just tell it what material is inside it
__label__0 can cut things or engrave things like
__label__0 plastics and woods and it has lots of
__label__0 really cool automatically based features
__label__0 like the one we used here which was able
__label__0 to cut our logo into a puzzle without us
__label__0 doing any extra work and the quality of
__label__0 life improvements just kind of keep on
__label__0 going it has a camera built into it so
__label__0 that you can actually see what the laser
__label__0 engravers see so when you need to set
__label__0 your object inside you don't have to do
__label__0 it with a whole bunch of different
__label__0 measurements and stuff you can just line
__label__0 it up with a camera and you're good to
__label__0 go it also is able to auto focus the
__label__0 camera along a curve so if you're doing
__label__0 something like engraving the top of a
__label__0 Macbook it can see the edges and engrave
__label__0 along the edges autofocusing the laser
__label__0 so you don't have any mistakes on the
__label__0 side and you don't have to do anything
__label__0 way too fancy they use mirrors to
__label__0 redirect the laser this can sometimes be
__label__0 an issue because if the mirror is
__label__0 misaligned
__label__0 it can cause various problems we would
__label__0 prefer that they use something like
__label__0 fiber optics but they put the mirrors
__label__0 into solid aluminum blocks and once a
__label__0 bolt is in place those things aren't
__label__0 moving so it should probably be fine the
__label__0 delicate components in the head are also
__label__0 completely sealed off which is great
__label__0 because that means less maintenance for
__label__0 you as it won't be able to get gummed up
__label__0 but if you do need to access it you can
__label__0 just simply remove it with a few magnets
__label__0 there's three stepper motors to move
__label__0 everything around you've got one on each
__label__0 side to control the y-axis and then one
__label__0 in the back to control the x-axis the
__label__0 laser moves along with the head in terms
__label__0 of the y-axis to keep everything aligned
__label__0 thing that you might notice is that it's
__label__0 not the biggest unit ever but that
__label__0 doesn't completely limit you in terms of
__label__0 y-axis printing you can actually print
__label__0 things that go pretty far because it has
__label__0 a pass-through slot so you can feed
__label__0 things through the laser engraver while
__label__0 it's going so it doesn't completely work
__label__0 right now but theoretically what will
__label__0 happen is you'll put part of it in it'll
__label__0 laser engrave what it needs to it'll cut
__label__0 what it needs to and then when it's
__label__0 ready you can feed more of it in and
__label__0 they'll just do the next part and so on
__label__0 and so forth until you're done but said
__label__0 pass-through slot does come at an
__label__0 additional expense if you do want the
__label__0 basic version that's four thousand
__label__0 dollars it comes with a 40 watt laser
__label__0 and that's about it no pass-through slot
__label__0 no built-in venting if you do want to
__label__0 vent it out you can send it out through
__label__0 a window or you can just do it outside
__label__0 or something like that or you can spend
__label__0 a thousand dollars and buy that built-in
__label__0 vent if you want to jump up to the pro
__label__0 version that's eight thousand dollars it
__label__0 has that $1,000 vent built-in it has the
__label__0 pass-through slot and it has a 45 watt
__label__0 laser so that can do faster cuts well
__label__0 for the average consumer
__label__0 definitely including myself this is
__label__0 really expensive it is cool to see a
__label__0 more consumer focused laser etcher slash
__label__0 cutter now you don't just have to be an
__label__0 engineer or have one at your school or
__label__0 something like that you can do this at
__label__0 home if you can afford it
__label__1 speak your be able to afford things be
__label__1 able to afford more things by using
__label__1 fresh books and running your business
__label__1 through it you can create invoices in
__label__1 less than 30 seconds you can get paid up
__label__1 to four days faster you can see when
__label__1 your clients have seen your invoice so
__label__1 if you're running a company that makes
__label__1 really cool purses or draft signs with a
__label__1 laser enter slash cutter you would be
__label__1 able to get your invoices created really
__label__1 quickly be able to see if your customers
__label__1 cannot have actually seen your invoices
__label__1 and you can go on from there if you want
__label__1 a free 30 day unrestricted trial go to

__label__0 guys later
__label__0 if we find aliens what do we do next
__label__0 when discussing first contact many are
__label__0 quick to point out that historically
__label__0 contact between culturally different
__label__0 civilizations has almost always led to
__label__0 the destruction of one of those
__label__0 civilizations because of this you could
__label__0 argue that we should stick to ourselves
__label__0 leave the aliens alone but in almost
__label__0 every one of those historical examples
__label__0 its the civilization that makes contact
__label__0 that destroys the civilization that
__label__0 receives contact so perhaps we should go
__label__0 on the offensive find the aliens before
__label__0 they find us of course we've been trying
__label__0 for decades to find extraterrestrial
__label__0 life it's one of humanity's great
__label__0 questions are we alone one way we might
__label__0 find aliens is by looking at stars or
__label__0 more specifically the light level of
__label__0 stars as the earth has developed our
__label__0 energy consumption has skyrocketed
__label__0 that's just the consequence of an
__label__0 increasingly technologically advanced
__label__0 world it's suspected that this trend
__label__0 will continue
__label__0 and it's also suspected that with any
__label__0 alien civilization they'll also require
__label__0 more and more energy as they advance
__label__0 eventually any planetary civilization
__label__0 will reach a point where the amount of
__label__0 energy on their planet is not enough to
__label__0 sustain their advancing civilization
__label__0 theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson
__label__0 speculated that when a planetary
__label__0 civilization needs more energy than
__label__0 their planet can provide they'll turn to
__label__0 the Sun stars are the most abundant
__label__0 source of energy in any planetary system
__label__0 so a super advanced civilization could
__label__0 build a series of satellites to orbit
__label__0 around their Sun to collect energy when
__label__0 sunlight travels through space it loses
__label__0 energy until the amount of energy
__label__0 captured by a solar panel near the Sun
__label__0 would be astronomically higher than a
__label__0 solar panel on earth with more energy as
__label__0 civilization could produce more
__label__0 satellites and eventually there would be
__label__0 a swarm of satellites orbiting the Sun
__label__0 Freeman Dyson believes that this is the
__label__0 most logical way that any civilization
__label__0 would harvest the energy they need so if
__label__0 we search for a star with orbiting
__label__0 satellites we might be able to find an
__label__0 alien civilization no telescope is
__label__0 powerful enough to see the individual
__label__0 satellites but we can rather easily
__label__0 observe the light level of stars you see
__label__0 once a faraway civilization building
__label__0 satellites the swarm will start to block
__label__0 our view of their son as the satellites
__label__0 orbit from our perspective it will look
__label__0 like this star is twinkling something
__label__0 completely unnatural so by looking for
__label__0 stars with highly variable light levels
__label__0 we might be able to find an alien
__label__0 civilization harvesting the energy of
__label__0 their Sun kic eight four six two eight
__label__0 five two also known as tabby star is a
__label__0 star in the Cygnus constellation of the
__label__0 Milky Way scientists observe the light
__label__0 level of this star for years and they
__label__0 regularly came across irregularities
__label__0 like this maybe there are comments or a
__label__0 debris field obstructing our view of
__label__0 this star but astronomers have doubted
__label__0 that either of those could dip the light
__label__0 levels by this much this has led some to
__label__0 suggest that an alien civilization has
__label__0 built these orbiting satellites around
__label__0 their Sun but we may never know for
__label__0 certain of course all of this is
__label__0 somewhat speculative and it's unlikely
__label__0 that we'd actually find a so-called
__label__0 Dyson Sphere around a Sun it's more of a
__label__0 thought experiment demonstrating that we
__label__0 could find aliens through looking for
__label__0 their impact on the universe conversely
__label__0 aliens might find us based on our effect
__label__0 on the universe that's why we very
__label__0 purposely sent out messages to our
__label__0 hypothetical cosmic neighbors the
__label__0 pioneer plaques were designed and placed
__label__0 on the to pioneer spacecrafts which were
__label__0 the first to explore the far reaches of
__label__0 the solar system since these two are
__label__0 some of the farthest man-made objects
__label__0 from Earth they were sent with a message
__label__0 in case extraterrestrials come across
__label__0 the probes this is what was sent the
__label__0 pioneer plaque it has a representation
__label__0 of hydrogen the most abundant element in
__label__0 the universe a picture of a man and
__label__0 woman including a raised hand a gesture
__label__0 that most likely wouldn't be understood
__label__0 but shows how our limbs move and the
__label__0 existence of the opposable thumb an
__label__0 image of the Pioneer spacecraft behind
__label__0 the humans so that the extraterrestrials
__label__0 could figure out the rough size of
__label__0 humans the location of the Sun relative
__label__0 to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen
__label__0 spin flip transition frequency as the
__label__0 unit something far too complicated for
__label__0 me to explain and lastly an image of the
__label__0 solar system with the rough trajectory
__label__0 of the Pioneer spacecraft but there are
__label__0 issues with this image we have no idea
__label__0 how
__label__0 aliens gather information humans are a
__label__0 visual species since we have relatively
__label__0 good vision so it's natural for us to
__label__0 convey information through images aliens
__label__0 on the other hand could have poor or no
__label__0 vision and therefore no conception of
__label__0 the idea of transferring information
__label__0 through images or they could interpret
__label__0 the symbols vastly differently
__label__0 perhaps the most frequently criticized
__label__0 aspect of the plaque is the arrow it's
__label__0 believed that the arrow symbol is
__label__0 derived from either the shape of arrows
__label__0 or the human hand pointing or perhaps a
__label__0 combination of both
__label__0 aliens would most likely have neither
__label__0 arrows or hands and therefore no idea
__label__0 what this symbol means they could also
__label__0 make the dangerous assumption that the
__label__0 symbol depicts a weapon launching
__label__0 meaning that the spacecraft was sent to
__label__0 harm them other sets of images have been
__label__0 sent with subsequent space probes but
__label__0 the chance of aliens finding these few
__label__0 tiny objects in the vastness of space is
__label__0 miniscule what's far more likely is that
__label__0 aliens will discover humanity off of
__label__0 something we've been sending out for
__label__0 over a hundred years radio signals while
__label__0 most are too weak to reach faraway
__label__0 galaxies some do travel through space
__label__0 and could be picked up by
__label__0 extraterrestrial civilizations
__label__0 especially more advanced ones with
__label__0 better detection technology than us it's
__label__0 entirely possible that we've already
__label__0 unintentionally sent the signal that
__label__0 will be our first message to an
__label__0 extraterrestrial civilization it's also
__label__0 entirely possible that the first sign we
__label__0 will have of extraterrestrial life is a
__label__0 radio message from another planet the
__label__0 problem is then deciphering it the first
__label__0 step is deciding what the message even
__label__0 is is a binary is a radiation is a
__label__0 natural language what is it we can
__label__0 figure this out in the English language
__label__0 the most common word the accounts for
__label__0 about seven percent of all word
__label__0 occurrences the second most common word
__label__0 e accounts for about 3.5 percent of all
__label__0 words then and is about 2.3 percent and
__label__0 so on and so forth the distribution of
__label__0 words it turns out in all languages
__label__0 follows a logarithmic scale the second
__label__0 most common word occurs about half as
__label__0 frequently as the most common the third
__label__0 1/3 is often the fourth one fourth is
__label__0 often the fifth one fifth is often and
__label__0 so on and so forth this is somehow true
__label__0 for all languages E
__label__0 with no common ancestral language which
__label__0 means that more than likely an alien
__label__0 language will follow the same
__label__0 distribution it's not entirely
__label__0 understood why languages follow this
__label__0 distribution but one possible
__label__0 explanation is that people are lazy it's
__label__0 called a principle of least effort
__label__0 people animals even machines will always
__label__0 pick the path of least resistance the
__label__0 easiest path and in the case of language
__label__0 the meaning that needs to be most
__label__0 frequently conveyed will be attached to
__label__0 the most common word rather than a
__label__0 number of other words since that is
__label__0 easiest that keeps happening down to the
__label__0 least frequent word therefore creating
__label__0 this distribution with an
__label__0 extraterrestrial transmission if we rank
__label__0 the sounds by frequency and it follows
__label__0 this distribution we can believe that
__label__0 it's most likely a language but then we
__label__0 need to try to understand the language
__label__0 for this we need to drop all assumptions
__label__0 there are innate similarities across all
__label__0 human languages mostly related to
__label__0 grammar for example pretty much every
__label__0 language separates description words
__label__0 nouns from action words verbs
__label__0 grammatically there are huge
__label__0 similarities between all languages even
__label__0 ones that develop separately some have
__label__0 suggested that this means that humans
__label__0 have a genetic framework for language
__label__0 perhaps we are hardwired from birth to
__label__0 understand what nouns and verbs and
__label__0 sentences are and learning a language is
__label__0 just the process of filling in and
__label__0 understanding that framework from
__label__0 everything we understand about the
__label__0 communication systems that animals use
__label__0 they do not have a universal grammar
__label__0 like humans we therefore have to assume
__label__0 that an alien language would be
__label__0 fundamentally different than ours we
__label__0 don't know how those structure sentences
__label__0 we don't even know if they'll have
__label__0 sentences the problem is if we just
__label__0 receive a natural language transmission
__label__0 there's really nothing we can do when
__label__0 deciphering ancient languages linguist
__label__0 figure out meaning using context and
__label__0 relations to other languages but with an
__label__0 alien language transmission there is no
__label__0 context and no other similar languages
__label__0 to compare it with all this is assuming
__label__0 that aliens use a verbal language and
__label__0 that's a huge assumption many if not
__label__0 most animals have no verbal
__label__0 communication system
__label__0 fish and chameleons alter their body
__label__0 color to communicate while ants and
__label__0 honeybees use pheromones to talk to
__label__0 other members of their species even if
__label__0 we understood their language could we
__label__0 understand what they're saying take this
__label__0 sentence in French translating it
__label__0 literally word-for-word gets you the
__label__0 palace verb on is the name commonly
__label__0 given to the building that houses the
__label__0 assembly national French located on the
__label__0 Kiev or say in the seventh borough of
__label__0 Paris of the square of the Concorde even
__label__0 if you clean it up to a structure it
__label__0 like an English sentence how much
__label__0 meaning is conveyed to you what exactly
__label__0 is the French National Assembly where is
__label__0 the Chi of or say where is the seventh
__label__0 borough where is Concorde Square someone
__label__0 familiar to Paris and France would
__label__0 understand what these words mean but
__label__0 someone from the other side of the world
__label__0 would infer little meaning from them
__label__0 philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously
__label__0 wrote if a lion could speak we would not
__label__0 be able to understand him language is
__label__0 all based on cultures and requires a
__label__0 common frame of reference if you said
__label__0 I'm taking an uber to get some coffee at
__label__0 Starbucks there's no way it would
__label__0 understand what you're saying you have
__label__0 to explain what uber is then explain
__label__0 what a car is what the internet is what
__label__0 a phone is an app coffee Starbucks
__label__0 stores the monetary system all stuff
__label__0 that is intuitive to modern humans
__label__0 translating the words of an
__label__0 extraterrestrial civilization is just
__label__0 the first step understanding what
__label__0 they're saying is the more difficult
__label__0 task centuries or millennia after
__label__0 detecting aliens we might reach a day
__label__0 when an extraterrestrial being comes to
__label__0 earth if this happens the alien
__label__0 civilization is almost certainly more
__label__0 advanced than humans since it has
__label__0 accomplished interstellar travel and
__label__0 perhaps even faster than light travel
__label__0 but we want to show that us humans are
__label__0 intelligent as well of course the et
__label__0 would see everything that humans have
__label__0 built but they might interpret the
__label__0 structures of mankind as natural
__label__0 phenomenons we can't assume that they
__label__0 think that buildings and cars and
__label__0 artificial light are not part of a
__label__0 natural structure of Earth we therefore
__label__0 need to show them that we have at least
__label__0 a basic understanding of the universe
__label__0 math as far as we know is universal no
__label__0 matter where you go or who you ask 2
__label__0 plus 2 is 4 and the ratio of a circles
__label__0 circumference to diameter is 3.14159 2
__label__0 and so on and so forth
__label__0 of course what you call two or four or
__label__0 PI would be different but the concepts
__label__0 are the same therefore we could show the
__label__0 aliens our understanding of math put 2
__label__0 then 2 &amp; 4 4 &amp; 4 then 8 keep this going
__label__0 until they get the point although
__label__0 perhaps the best mathematical principle
__label__0 to demonstrate would be the Pythagorean
__label__0 theorem it's complicated
__label__0 but easy to show the Pythagorean theorem
__label__0 of course demonstrates that in the case
__label__0 of a right triangle the square of the
__label__0 side opposite to the right angle is
__label__0 equal to the square of the other two
__label__0 sides combined in an equation that reads
__label__0 a squared plus B squared equals C
__label__0 squared
__label__0 visually we can demonstrate this by
__label__0 drawing squares on the two shorter sides
__label__0 out of smaller squares and show how the
__label__0 amount of squares on the two sides
__label__0 equals the amount of squares on the
__label__0 longer side showing this theorem cements
__label__0 that humans do understand how the
__label__0 mathematical aspect of our universe
__label__0 works even though were less advanced
__label__0 than the aliens so now that we've found
__label__0 the aliens now that we have met them we
__label__0 can talk to them someone needs to speak
__label__0 first but let's say was you let's say
__label__0 you were given the chance to ask the
__label__0 first question from humanity to an
__label__0 extraterrestrial being you became the
__label__0 first point of contact between humanity
__label__0 and the universe what would you ask I

__label__0  Peace be upon you, I'm Dustin, and welcome to "Every day smarter"
__label__0  I have just interviewed the President of the United States of America
__label__0  It really is strange to me because I'm not a journalist
__label__0  I'm not a politician, I'm a rocket engineer
__label__0  I will, however, take a different view from the rest of the people
__label__0  The interview with the president is something different because you learn a lot about it
__label__0  The White House is also definitely, but you learn things about yourself as well
__label__0  The video will contain 4 paragraphs
__label__0  1. How it happened. 2. What were my goals from this interview
__label__0  3. The interview is complete. 4. And what is declared of it.
__label__0  What I understood is that there were many candidates to meet the president
__label__0  At one point, it became one of the candidates most likely to do so
__label__0  I did not register on the basis of liberal or democratic, and the question was asked: for the benefit of the voice
__label__0  And I did not answer
__label__0  But the way I answered it made it clear to me
__label__0  I will not be selected for the interview
__label__0  And it happened the opposite and I chose
__label__0  It was a secret for 3 weeks and then went to Los Angeles to film an interview.
__label__0  There she met Adnold and Ingrid
__label__0  They were very fun and humble too
__label__0  When I returned home I asked suggestions about the questions I should ask on the Internet
__label__0  I received all kinds of answers
__label__0  I mean good and bad too. It was fun
__label__0  But think about it, I do not agree with the president on all issues
