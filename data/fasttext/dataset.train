__label__1 thank you master off for sponsoring this
__label__1 video at CES 2018 check out their
__label__1 Sennheiser 6xx headphones in the link in
__label__1 the description down below we are here
__label__0 at Coolermaster checking out their H 500
__label__0 m and no stops pulled case and we start
__label__0 off with four tempered glass panels one
__label__0 just on the sides you can see all the
__label__0 beautiful internals of your case one on
__label__0 the top and the front so you can see the
__label__0 fans and one on the back so you can see
__label__0 your cable management now the tempered
__label__0 glass panel on the front can slide out
__label__0 I'm not going to do it right now because
__label__0 prototype case and stuff but it can
__label__0 slide out and you can put in a mesh
__label__0 grille so if you're worried about the
__label__0 airflow it's fine don't worry about it
__label__0 it comes in the box no big deal but it
__label__0 does also have mesh on each side and
__label__0 along the top so that these four big
__label__0 fans can all breathe properly even if
__label__0 you do decide to leave that tempered
__label__0 glass in and right now at the show
__label__0 they're not filtered but they will be
__label__0 filtered once you guys are able to get
__label__0 it into your hands I have been told for
__label__0 front IO its kind of front slash top IO
__label__0 the power button is the Coolermaster
__label__0 logo but with no text in it nice and
__label__0 subtle and it has an illuminated ring
__label__0 around it to the right of that you've
__label__0 got a hard drive activity led to the
__label__0 left of that you have headphone and
__label__0 microphone jacks and then above you have
__label__0 tons of USB which is great to see you
__label__0 have four USB three type-a ports and one
__label__0 USB type-c port which is awesome I'm
__label__0 happy that cases are starting to have
__label__0 these on the front because you're
__label__0 starting to see more c2c cables out
__label__0 there in the wild which is really cool
__label__0 moving on to the inside of the case the
__label__0 main notable part that you're gonna see
__label__0 is the power supply shroud it's been
__label__0 around for a while now but this one does
__label__0 have a cutout again been around for a
__label__0 while now but this one is illuminated
__label__0 which is cool and there's the subtle
__label__0 outside halo logo as well I kind of
__label__0 maybe suggested that they also include a
__label__0 blank in the case just like how they had
__label__0 the mesh front they would have some swap
__label__0 ability for you and we'll we'll see what
__label__0 happens there just in case you have a
__label__0 different brand of power supply or you
__label__0 want to orientate it in a different way
__label__0 or something else there's also the
__label__0 ever-popular option to mount your
__label__0 graphics card vertically so if you don't
__label__0 have two cards like they have in this
__label__0 setup which is beautiful by the way but
__label__0 if you don't have two cards you want to
__label__0 have one and you want to display the
__label__0 really cool part of the card which you
__label__0 rarely actually get to see which is at
__label__0 the side with the fans on it you
__label__0 mounted vertically you might have also
__label__0 noticed that the lighting in the room
__label__0 has changed quite a bit while I've been
__label__0 hosting this video that is in sync with
__label__0 what's on screen it's called screen
__label__0 follow it has to do with their master
__label__0 Plus lighting control basically anything
__label__0 that can connect through Wi-Fi or the
__label__0 internet in your house or a 4-pin which
__label__0 like fans in the case and whatnot can
__label__0 all sync together and follow your screen
__label__0 or just be set to one color whatever you
__label__0 kind of want to do we even had something
__label__0 earlier
__label__0 where they brought paint up on the
__label__0 screen and then just made the whole
__label__0 paint a different color and all the
__label__0 lights in the room wouldn't follow that
__label__0 color it was pretty cool it's nice
__label__0 because with traditional setups they're
__label__0 all separate the Nano Leafs might be one
__label__0 one mode your computer might be on
__label__0 another mode other lighting in the room
__label__0 might be in another mode it gets kind of
__label__0 messy and you have all these different
__label__0 controllers and need to sync everything
__label__0 up and the not great with this setup
__label__0 it's all done through your computer you
__label__0 can nicely set it up on your desktop
__label__0 it's all handled it's all in one
__label__0 solution better that way
__label__0 and last but not least let's jump behind
__label__0 the motherboard panel we did already
__label__0 mention that there's tempered glass back
__label__0 here but a good pair for tempered glass
__label__0 behind another word panel is good cable
__label__0 management because if you have messy
__label__0 cables back there it's kind of a
__label__0 negative to have a tempered glass panel
__label__0 so they handle all of that for you which
__label__0 is really cool they have big panels
__label__0 covering up all the messy cables so you
__label__0 don't have to worry about it which is a
__label__1 huge benefit also of huge benefit thank
__label__1 you to master out for bringing us the
__label__1 CES 2018 this year check out there is HD
__label__1 6xx headphones in the description down
__label__1 below they're USD $200 and they have the
__label__1 same sound signature of HD 650s which is
__label__1 cool I have a pair at home they're
__label__1 comfortable they sound great they're
__label__1 open just so you know that's an
__label__1 important thing for audio files out
__label__1 there but yeah if you like them check
__label__1 them out the link below other than that
__label__0 like the video if you liked it just like
__label__0 the video if you disliked it stay
__label__0 subscribe for all of our CES 2018
__label__0 content there's a ton of it like over 40
__label__0 videos coming eventually I've heard so
__label__0 we'll see how that goes and I'll see you
__label__0 guys next time
__label__1 this video from CES 2018 is brought to
__label__1 you by Dollar Shave Club get a great
__label__1 shave for just a few dollars a month
__label__1 that dollarshaveclub.com slash line is
__label__1 linked below so we're here in the
__label__0 Corsair suite where they are going more
__label__0 tempered glass and more RGB than ever
__label__0 before what a freaking surprise so
__label__0 behind me I've actually got a case that
__label__0 includes no RGB lighting whatsoever
__label__0 this is the Obsidian 500 d and i'm just
__label__0 gonna put it in front of that one for
__label__0 reasons that I will reveal quite shortly
__label__0 this is Corsairs first case with
__label__0 integrated native USB type-c in the
__label__0 front including that 20 pin connector on
__label__0 the inside that is supported on newer
__label__0 motherboards it's got a tempered glass
__label__0 side panel it's got support for two hard
__label__0 drives and three SSDs on the back of the
__label__0 motherboard tray and water cooling
__label__0 support is actually pretty wide open as
__label__0 well it can take up to a triple 120
__label__0 millimeter in the front and a dual 140
__label__0 millimeter in the top and part of that
__label__0 is thanks to its extremely efficient
__label__0 that's fine
__label__0 extremely efficient use of its internal
__label__0 space so it's got a lot of room up here
__label__0 for a big radiator and fins and then
__label__0 it's almost no clearance between the
__label__0 motherboard and the power supply
__label__0 basement down here now this guy's going
__label__0 to be 149 or something along those lines
__label__0 and should be available pretty soon but
__label__0 honestly this isn't the one that I'm not
__label__0 excited about oh yeah there's a
__label__0 removable fan filter I'm not sure how it
__label__0 comes out but no removable fan filter so
__label__0 I'm just gonna put that aside be right
__label__0 back this is the sexy one so this would
__label__0 cost quite a bit more if it were to make
__label__0 it to market
__label__0 it's got curved tempered glass on the
__label__0 front just like the concept slate that
__label__0 we showed off last year slash did a
__label__0 video of quite recently it's showing off
__label__0 the vertical GPU mounting that is also
__label__0 available in its little brother and it
__label__0 is also planned to include Corsairs
__label__0 light loop RGB fans so the plan if it
__label__0 were to become a real product would also
__label__0 be to
__label__0 include a Corsair commander Pro so you
__label__0 can RG be affected up and estimated may
__label__0 be hypothetical pricing somewhere in the
__label__0 250 dollar range and for how good this
__label__0 thing looks it could be the case to beat
__label__0 if you're into mid towers with tempered
__label__0 glass an RGB but let's say you're not
__label__0 into RGB and you want to spend a lot of
__label__0 money course there has a new power
__label__0 supply for you it has been four years
__label__0 since the ax 1500 I and it finally has a
__label__0 big brother although it should be noted
__label__0 it's actually two centimeters shorter
__label__0 this is the ax 1600 I uses gallium
__label__0 nitride MOSFETs in order to achieve its
__label__0 astonishing 94% efficiency at 100% load
__label__0 that is four percent higher than the 80
__label__0 plus titanium spec so the reason Corsair
__label__0 hasn't done a successor to the 1500 I is
__label__0 that anything higher than that would
__label__0 trip a 120 volt North American breaker
__label__0 anyway well they got this thing so
__label__0 efficient that is only pulling seventeen
__label__0 hundred and thirty watts from the wall
__label__0 at a hundred percent load meaning that
__label__0 it won't trip your breaker whew
__label__0 it also comes with coursera link support
__label__0 and my favorite this was actually
__label__0 something that I suggested to course at
__label__0 one point why do you guys just have
__label__0 these stickers that you can't remove I
__label__0 was like can I get a new sticker waiting
__label__0 you why don't you just do magnet oh oh
__label__0 it's got magnetic magnetic logos you can
__label__0 put it on whatever way you want it comes
__label__0 with blue and red and white and then the
__label__0 stock is just the the traditional
__label__0 corsair matches everything gray this
__label__0 guy's going to be priced at for $99.99
__label__1 holy okay well uh thanks to Dollar Shave
__label__1 Club for sponsoring this video here at

__label__0 see you at the next suite by the way
__label__0 this is every country in the world part
__label__0 two by Wendover productions if you
__label__0 haven't seen part one click here to
__label__0 watch that first we left off last time
__label__0 in Suriname our 90th country Suriname is
__label__0 the only country other than the
__label__0 Netherlands whose sole primary language
__label__0 is Dutch although there are other
__label__0 countries that speak a creole version of
__label__0 Dutch like Namibia which speaks
__label__0 Afrikaans
__label__0 which is just close enough to Dutch that
__label__0 a Dutch and Namibian can hold a
__label__0 conversation Namibia has this long
__label__0 protrusion which gives them access to
__label__0 the Zambezi River although they miss out
__label__0 by about 300 feet on bordering Zimbabwe
__label__0 which is the country ferries have to
__label__0 pass through when making the 600 foot
__label__0 trip from Botswana to Zambia this is
__label__0 likely the shortest ferry in the world
__label__0 to cross through three countries to the
__label__0 northeast of Zambia is one of the
__label__0 world's 176 try points triple border
__label__0 crossings this one links Zambia to
__label__0 Malawi and Tanzania whose northern
__label__0 border is a very straight line across
__label__0 Lake Victoria which creates these two
__label__0 tiny cutoff peninsulas Uganda is a
__label__0 surprisingly progressive nation with the
__label__0 highest representation of women in
__label__0 Parliament in the world at 63% they also
__label__0 became the first country in the world to
__label__0 outright ban plastic bags in 2007 the
__label__0 Solomon Islands on the other hand only
__label__0 has a one women in their Parliament or
__label__0 2% representation the Solomon Islands is
__label__0 home to the West Georgia Island which
__label__0 share a name with Georgia which kind of
__label__0 shares a name with Georgia's plane in
__label__0 Jamaica which is one of two countries in
__label__0 the world whose flag doesn't share
__label__0 colors with the American flag as in no
__label__0 red white or blue the other one is more
__label__0 Tanya but Libya used to be on that list
__label__0 until they change their flag from this
__label__0 to this in 2011 Libya is so large that
__label__0 its Northwest point is closer to
__label__0 Luxembourg into its southeast Point
__label__0 Luxembourg has the second highest per
__label__0 capita income in the world behind Qatar
__label__0 a small but mighty country that's just a
__label__0 bit larger than Lebanon who shares a
__label__0 southern border with a united nations
__label__0 disengagement observer force zone which
__label__0 is an area essentially without
__label__0 sovereignty meant to serve as a buffer
__label__0 between Israeli controlled Syria and
__label__0 Syria one could call it a demilitarized
__label__0 zone although the most famous DMZ is
__label__0 north of South Korea where if you dig a
__label__0 hole straight down and through the earth
__label__0 you'd pop up just off the coast of
__label__0 Aragua
__label__0 ergh Way was a military dictatorship up
__label__0 until 1985
__label__0 but Thailand still is the only current
__label__0 one Bangkok Thailand is the most visited
__label__0 city in the world at 16 million yearly
__label__0 visitors which is a ton especially
__label__0 compared to Vilnius Lithuania which only
__label__0 sees a hundred and eighty thousand
__label__0 visitors per year Lithuania has a rather
__label__0 straight border through this lake which
__label__0 leads to two peninsulas with their tops
__label__0 chopped off and an internationally
__label__0 divided islands with Belarus which has a
__label__0 rather straight border in this lake
__label__0 which leads to another peninsula with
__label__0 his top dropped off and an
__label__0 internationally divided island with
__label__0 latvia latvian independence day is May
__label__0 the 4th aka Star Wars day whose scenes
__label__0 on Tatooine were filmed in Tunisia
__label__0 Tunisia as currency is the dinar which
__label__0 is also the name for the currency in
__label__0 Macedonia if you look at Macedonia on a
__label__0 map it will almost always have f yr o M
__label__0 under steam which stands for Former
__label__0 Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia when
__label__0 Macedonia became an independent country
__label__0 they picked this name but Greece wasn't
__label__0 all too happy about it since their
__label__0 northern region is also called Macedonia
__label__0 so the solution was to call the country
__label__0 the Former Yugoslav Republic of
__label__0 Macedonia in all official capacities
__label__0 while colloquially it's still known as
__label__0 Macedonia Greece is known for having a
__label__0 huge expatriated population around the
__label__0 world and the 39th largest Greek
__label__0 population in the world is in Oman in
__label__0 the Middle East
__label__0 inside Oman is an ex-slave of the United
__label__0 Arab Emirates except this part of Oman
__label__0 is actually an enclave inside the UAE
__label__0 which makes this the only double Enclave
__label__0 in the Middle East the UAE is one of 18
__label__0 countries worldwide to not have a river
__label__0 one of which is Tonga which actually has
__label__0 an Olympic medal from their super
__label__0 heavyweight boxer payout wolfgramm
__label__0 another country that has won total medal
__label__0 is Gabon whose southern border is shared
__label__0 with Congo whose southern border is
__label__0 shared with this rather large ex-slave
__label__0 of Angola only because of that exclave
__label__0 Angola borders both Congo and the
__label__0 Democratic Republic of the Congo these
__label__0 are of course two different countries
__label__0 although they're both named for the
__label__0 Congo River the deepest river in the
__label__0 world at more than 750 feet deep
__label__0 interestingly despite being both
__label__0 enormous countries their current
__label__0 capitals are just on opposite sides of
__label__0 the Congo from each other the DRC has
__label__0 this great clean border with Rwanda
__label__0 which causes no problems at all unlike
__label__0 this one in Austria you Holtz is only
__label__0 connected to the rest of Austria by
__label__0 about 15 feet of territory and no row
__label__0 Vienna Austria used to be the capital of
__label__0 the austria-hungarian empire whose
__label__0 territory included present-day Italy
__label__0 Poland Germany Croatia Montenegro and
__label__0 Serbia all of which we've already talked
__label__0 about in Bosnia and Herzegovina the
__label__0 Czech Republic Hungary Romania Slovakia
__label__0 and Ukraine Ukraine has this southern
__label__0 section which isn't part of Russia yet
__label__0 although it's only connected to the rest
__label__0 of Ukraine by two wrote one of which
__label__0 rather in conveniently passes through
__label__0 Moldova for only about three miles
__label__0 Moldova is rated the third least
__label__0 touristy country in the world since only
__label__0 one tourist visits each year for every
__label__0 323 citizens although Bangladesh is the
__label__0 number one least touristy country since
__label__0 for each yearly tourist visit there are
__label__0 one thousand two hundred and
__label__0 seventy-three Bangladeshi citizens
__label__0 Bahrain on the other hand receives 7.7
__label__0 tourist visits per citizen per year and
__label__0 also has an internationally divided
__label__0 island but this one was actually very
__label__0 purposefully created to serve as a
__label__0 passport control point between Bahrain
__label__0 and Saudi Arabia on the King Fahd
__label__0 causeway Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca
__label__0 the birthplace of the central figure of
__label__0 Islam the Prophet Muhammad Mecca has a
__label__0 population of about 1.5 million but
__label__0 during the Hajj the yearly pilgrimage to
__label__0 Mecca this triples to almost 5 million
__label__0 people
__label__0 land in Mecca is some of the most
__label__0 expensive in the world at up to 13,000
__label__0 dollars per square foot Saudi Arabia
__label__0 really isn't great friends with our
__label__0 southern neighbor Yemen who owns over
__label__0 200 islands including Saku trial in'
__label__0 which is surprisingly green compared to
__label__0 its mainland neighbors and is the only
__label__0 place in the world where you can find
__label__0 the dragon's blood tree
__label__0 Yemen's national soccer team has played
__label__0 Boutin three times in the last few
__label__0 decades
__label__0 all of which Boutin lost rather horribly
__label__0 Bhutan is home to the gang carp wins a
__label__0 mountain which is believed to be the
__label__0 tallest unsummoned mountain in the world
__label__0 since the local spiritual beliefs
__label__0 prohibit anyone from climbing a mountain
__label__0 over 6,000 meters this mountain is in
__label__0 the Himalayas range which if you follow
__label__0 to the west brings you to Nepal which is
__label__0 of course home to Mount Everest the
__label__0 tallest mountain in the world Everest is
__label__0 29,029 feet tall eight hundred and
__label__0 eighty times higher than the Marshall
__label__0 Islands tallest peak at 33 feet if you
__label__0 dig a hole straight down through the
__label__0 earth from the Marshall Island you
__label__0 arrive just off the coast from Liberia
__label__0 which is the country of registration of
__label__0 eleven percent of the world ships of the
__label__0 2007
__label__0 and seventy-one registered ships though
__label__0 only 190 are actually owned by Liberians
__label__0 foreigners register their ships there
__label__0 since there are few regulations and low
__label__0 costs Malta also registers many ships
__label__0 for the same reason with 1437 foreign
__label__0 owned ships malta is a European Union
__label__0 member which means that we've almost
__label__0 talked about every EU member our last
__label__0 two are Estonia and Ireland whose
__label__0 northernmost point is actually farther
__label__0 north than northern islands Ireland has
__label__0 played Samoa six times in rugby and
__label__0 Samoa actually won once which is quite
__label__0 impressive for a country of less than
__label__0 200,000 Simoes rugby team did once lose
__label__0 to New Zealand 101 214 though so they're
__label__0 not that good New Zealand has a kind of
__label__0 territory of new way it's recognized as
__label__0 a freely associated state meaning by
__label__0 choice but new way isn't recognized by
__label__0 the UN as an independent country however
__label__0 new way is exactly on the opposite side
__label__0 of the world from Niger which is named
__label__0 for the Niger River the Niger River has
__label__0 probably the most bizarre River course
__label__0 in the world it starts only 150 miles
__label__0 from the Atlantic Ocean but then takes a
__label__0 2600 mile path to reach the ocean
__label__0 it starts in Sierra Leone flows through
__label__0 Guinea Mali Niger itself then Benin
__label__0 before reaching the ocean in Nigeria
__label__0 Nigeria is also named after the Niger
__label__0 River and is by far the most populous
__label__0 country in Africa at 125 million people
__label__0 the least populous country in Africa is
__label__0 the Seychelles which isn't on the
__label__0 mainland but is still considered an
__label__0 African country they also have what
__label__0 might be the coolest flag in the world
__label__0 except for maybe st. Lucia's but I do
__label__0 have to give a solid runners-up position
__label__0 to st. Vincent and the Grenadines Saint
__label__0 Vincent and the Grenadines name is
__label__0 rather purposefully similar to that of
__label__0 its neighbouring Island Grenada
__label__0 granada's Airport wasn't built until
__label__0 1985 but nowadays you can fly to places
__label__0 like Port of Spain in Trinidad and
__label__0 Tobago Trinidad is also the name of a
__label__0 municipality of 20,000 people in
__label__0 Honduras which has two capitals
__label__0 Tegucigalpa and coma iguana much like
__label__0 the Cote d'Ivoire whose capitals are
__label__0 Yamoussoukro and Abidjan despite having
__label__0 a very easy English translation the
__label__0 Ivory Coast the Cote d'Ivoire is almost
__label__0 always referred to by this name since
__label__0 its government refuses to accept any
__label__0 translated name if you draw a straight
__label__0 line south from Cote d'Ivoire
__label__0 until it crosses
__label__0 Antartica and goes north you'll end up
__label__0 intersecting Vanuatu which is one of
__label__0 seven countries worldwide to not be part
__label__0 of the International Criminal Police
__label__0 organization also known as Interpol
__label__0 another non Interpol member country is
__label__0 Tuvalu which is the second smallest
__label__0 country in the world to have a
__label__0 commercial International Airport this is
__label__0 also the second video in a row that I've
__label__0 used this image watch my last video to
__label__0 find out why
__label__0 Nauru is the smallest country outright
__label__0 to have an airport and it rather
__label__0 controversial II has camps for those who
__label__0 attempt to seek asylum in Australia many
__label__0 of whom are from Iraq Iraq borders Iran
__label__0 which has 22 ski resorts that's more
__label__0 than the entire South American continent
__label__0 speaking of South America we haven't
__label__0 covered Paraguay which is another one of
__label__0 these landlocked countries with a navy
__label__0 and with that we've touched on every
__label__0 South American country if you dig a hole
__label__0 through the earth from Paraguay you end
__label__0 up just north of Philippines which is
__label__0 our seventh to last Asian country the
__label__0 other ones are Myanmar which is one of
__label__0 the world's three countries not using
__label__0 the metric system Timor Leste whose
__label__0 currency is the US dollar despite having
__label__0 no real connections to the u.s. Pakistan
__label__0 which is home to the third largest
__label__0 nonpolar glacier in the world despite
__label__0 being at the same latitude of South
__label__0 Texas Jordan which you may think is
__label__0 landlocked from looking at a map but
__label__0 actually has a 16 mile coast on the Red
__label__0 Sea Syria which is home to Damascus the
__label__0 oldest continuously inhabited city on
__label__0 the planet and Kuwait which has the
__label__0 highest value currency in the world
__label__0 at three point three US dollars to each
__label__0 Kuwaiti dinar with that we've covered
__label__0 every Asian country one of the lowest
__label__0 value currencies in the world is the
__label__0 South Thome and príncipe obrah at
__label__0 23,000 dobra to the dollar saw Toma and
__label__0 principal G's which means we've covered
__label__0 every Portuguese speaking country the
__label__0 country is also off the coast of
__label__0 Cameroon which became the first African
__label__0 country to reach the FIFA World Cup
__label__0 semi-finals in 1990 although that since
__label__0 been accomplished by Ghana where the
__label__0 official and primary language is English
__label__0 and there are only three more countries
__label__0 like this Belize the only
__label__0 english-speaking country in Central
__label__0 America
__label__0 Barbados who has the third highest Human
__label__0 Development Index score in the Western
__label__0 Hemisphere and Antigua and Barbuda whose
__label__0 native language tyno is the origin of
__label__0 English words like canoe barbecue
__label__0 hammock and hurricane so we've covered
__label__0 every english-speaking country but there
__label__0 are two remaining countries that were
__label__0 part
__label__0 the British Empire Dominika where
__label__0 Antillean Creole is the primary language
__label__0 and Mauritius which has the highest
__label__0 population density in Africa and over
__label__0 1,500 people per square mile
__label__0 one of the lowest population densities
__label__0 in Africa is in the Central African
__label__0 Republic at 18 people per square mile
__label__0 the Central African Republic's northern
__label__0 neighbor is Chad whose Embassy in
__label__0 Washington DC is only 200 feet away from
__label__0 that uh Burkina Faso whose capital has
__label__0 perhaps the best name in the world
__label__0 quagga dugu in the southeast of burkina
__label__0 faso is this piece of tokyo that is only
__label__0 connected to the main part by a 300 foot
__label__0 wide strip of land this area's roads
__label__0 however all come from burkina faso which
__label__0 means that much like point roberts
__label__0 residents need across two international
__label__0 borders to get to their own country
__label__0 there are only three African countries
__label__0 left
__label__0 Comoros the second largest vanilla
__label__0 producer in the world Burundi the
__label__0 poorest country in the world to have an
__label__0 Olympic medal and Eritrea which has
__label__0 neither an official or majority spoken
__label__0 language drawing a latitude line west
__label__0 from Eritrea brings you to Nicaragua
__label__0 home to a lake on an island in lake more
__label__0 than 100,000 Nicaraguans live in nearby
__label__0 el salvador which is the smallest
__label__0 Central American country and the only
__label__0 one not to have a Caribbean coastline
__label__0 El Salvador's northern neighbor is
__label__0 Guatemala whose border with Mexico was
__label__0 originally defined by the course of the
__label__0 Chickasaw river but erosion has changed
__label__0 the course which created a bunch of
__label__0 enclaves and exclaves like this this and
__label__0 this and that's our last country in the
__label__0 Western Hemisphere we're getting close
__label__0 Guatemala's embassy in Ottawa is about
__label__0 900 feet away from Slovenia's which has
__label__0 this really messed up border with
__label__0 Croatia including this tiny section
__label__0 which isn't actually claimed by either
__label__0 country making it terra nullius the
__label__0 tenth and final country to end in niña
__label__0 and our final country is Albania whose
__label__0 capital is one of the only in Europe to
__label__0 not have a McDonald's oh wait
__label__0 if you draw a latitude line from the
__label__0 south well vania that brings you to the
__label__0 north of Afghanistan where Albania sent
__label__0 44 troops to fight in 2005 and that's
__label__0 where we started this video so if you're

__label__0 video
__label__1 this video from CES 2018 is brought to
__label__1 you by the symbiote demo car from group
__label__1 Renault we'll have that linked in the
__label__1 video description so we're here in the
__label__0 asus rog suite where they've got a ton
__label__0 of amazing display technology on display
__label__0 first up is their 144 hertz 4k HDR
__label__0 gaming monitor that we actually saw
__label__0 demoed like a year ago the PG 2 7uq but
__label__0 the key difference is that they are
__label__0 actually going to be shipping this thing
__label__0 really soon so that's a large 27-inch
__label__0 g-sync display 144 hertz 4k pretty much
__label__0 can't go wrong unless of course you're
__label__0 into ultra wide gaming in which case
__label__0 might be more into the PG 35 VQ so
__label__0 that's a 34 40 by 1440 35 inch g-sync
__label__0 200 Hertz display so that is double the
__label__0 refresh rate of the predator x34 one of
__label__0 my personal favorite gaming displays
__label__0 also here is a Seuss's flavor oven
__label__0 videos BFG TV display what are they
__label__0 calling it yeah yeah BFG D or big format
__label__0 gaming display I don't think they have a
__label__0 model name for it yet but in a nutshell
__label__0 it's a 65 inch monitor effectively
__label__0 because it doesn't have a TV tuner but
__label__0 it does have a lot of features that are
__label__0 appealing to gamers so it uses a VA
__label__0 panel with a three thousand to 1
__label__0 contrast ratio it runs out a hundred and
__label__0 twenty Hertz 4k resolution with HDR and
__label__0 it has a built-in Nvidia shield so you
__label__0 can play Android games you can stream
__label__0 Netflix Amazon Prime
__label__0 etc but most importantly they're
__label__0 boasting ultra-low latency so if you're
__label__0 a couch gamer that looks like it's going
__label__0 to be the solution sometime later this
__label__0 year the most visually interesting one
__label__0 though is probably this guy now on the
__label__0 surface this looks pretty boring it's
__label__0 just like a couple of rubber pieces at
__label__0 the top and bottom and then it's a strip
__label__0 of PMMA which is a plastic material
__label__0 similar to acrylic but what's special
__label__0 about it
__label__0 is the Fresnel style lenses that are cut
__label__0 into it so traditionally the way to
__label__0 achieve bending of light would be to
__label__0 have like a big bubble lens but instead
__label__0 this just has a bunch of slits cut into
__label__0 it all along kind of similar to the
__label__0 rings that you see inside of an HTC vive
__label__0 and what it does is if you put it on top
__label__0 of the bezels of Zeus's PG 2 v 8 q
__label__0 gaming monitor it makes them essentially
__label__0 disappear by stretching the edge of this
__label__0 screen and the edge of this one creating
__label__0 a bezel effect now it's not perfect you
__label__0 do lose a little bit of light so they
__label__0 are a little bit dimmer but I will say
__label__0 that if you're into sim racing the
__label__0 experience is significantly more
__label__0 immersive they're optimized for a
__label__0 hundred and thirty degree angles and
__label__0 they're working on getting it working
__label__0 with the PG 35 V Q and pricing is
__label__0 expected to be able they don't know but
__label__0 they're saying under $100 which like I
__label__0 would hope so but like that seems pretty
__label__0 reasonable if you're into surround
__label__0 gaming so there you go I took apart
__label__1 their demo anyway this video was brought
__label__1 to you guys by the symbiote demo car
__label__1 from group Renault we checked it out
__label__1 quite recently it's their level 4
__label__1 autonomous car that I actually got to
__label__1 drive and I use the term drive with a
__label__1 serious asterisk on it because we
__label__1 managed to take it out on the freeway
__label__1 with my hands completely off the wheel
__label__1 the seat tilted back and then at its
__label__1 most extreme with a VR headset on that
__label__1 was actually simulating what it would be
__label__1 like if I was in a completely different
__label__1 environment whatsoever with the car
__label__1 sensors themselves tied into the VR
__label__1 headset so you guys are gonna want to
__label__1 check out that video to see the latest
__label__1 in autonomous driving innovations we're
__label__1 gonna have it linked in the video
__label__1 description so thanks for watching guys
__label__0 dislike or like check out well I mean
__label__0 you can't buy any of this stuff yet but
__label__0 check out subscribe so you don't miss
__label__0 any of our CES 2018 content
__label__1 this portion of our CES coverage is
__label__1 brought to you by LastPass check out the
__label__1 link in the video description to start
__label__1 securing your passwords today we are
__label__0 here at Delaware they're showing off the
__label__0 new XPS 13 and naming scheme aside it
__label__0 looks pretty darn impressive the first
__label__0 thing we noticed about it is that it is
__label__0 way smaller they actually removed 24% of
__label__0 the overall volume and they did all of
__label__0 that while making some pretty impressive
__label__0 upgrades so the bezels are even thinner
__label__0 it weighs even less at only about 1.2
__label__0 kilograms and it packs eighty percent
__label__0 ball Paw Paw bonds so it's got an eighth
__label__0 gen up to Core i7 processor and due to
__label__0 Dells unique cooling approach they are
__label__0 actually claiming that they're going to
__label__0 be able to turbo this bad boy up higher
__label__0 and for a longer and they're able to do
__label__0 this thanks to the dual heat pipe dual
__label__0 fan cooling solution that's capable of
__label__0 dissipating up to twenty-seven watts
__label__0 that they've packed in here
__label__0 they've added their insulation to the
__label__0 bottom and the top to keep too much of
__label__0 that heat from being passed to the user
__label__0 and there are a bunch of other creature
__label__0 comforts as well ships with up to a 4k
__label__0 HDR touchscreen display with full
__label__0 coverage of Adobe RGB the IO is a pretty
__label__0 solid mix with a three-and-a-half
__label__0 millimeter Jack USB 3 a micro SD and
__label__0 dual Thunderbolt included Windows hello
__label__0 with an IR emitter for face detection is
__label__0 included and even better than just being
__label__0 included it's no longer at the bottom
__label__0 left so they're just tied for the worst
__label__0 placement of their webcam instead of
__label__0 being actually the absolute worst and
__label__0 they are claiming up to 19 hours of
__label__0 battery life on this puppy
__label__0 what's more the white version they say
__label__0 is smudge resistant they wouldn't let us
__label__0 actually put permanent marker on it but
__label__0 they say that a lot of things should be
__label__0 able to just wipe right off like the
__label__0 rest of Dell's 2018 lineup it includes
__label__0 Dells Mobile Connect software which
__label__0 allows you whether it's Android or iOS
__label__0 to take calls answer
__label__0 messages and on Android even use apps
__label__0 just on an application on your desktop
__label__0 wirelessly and they are expecting it to
__label__0 be available sometime in March so thanks
__label__1 to LastPass you're sponsoring this video
__label__1 LastPass is a key part of the way that
__label__1 we manage our credentials and
__label__1 information for events like CES the last
__label__1 thing you want to be doing in the middle
__label__1 of the night when you're trying to get
__label__1 an upload up is calling someone else who
__label__1 may actually be sleeping to try to get a
__label__1 password or trying to do a password
__label__1 reset when then maybe you're on a new
__label__1 device because sometimes we use
__label__1 unfamiliar laptops that are you know
__label__1 more editing capable when we're doing
__label__1 trips like this you're not logged into
__label__1 anything
__label__1 LastPass takes care of all of that it
__label__1 allows you to manage your password
__label__1 safely and securely with a one strong
__label__1 password and optional two-factor
__label__1 authentication so you never have to
__label__1 reuse a password again and it even
__label__1 allows you to easily share with other
__label__1 people so if that sounds good to you
__label__1 whether you're looking at the premium
__label__1 option for personally is the team's
__label__1 option for small business or the
__label__1 enterprise option for large business
__label__1 check it out today we're gonna have that
__label__1 linked in the video description so
__label__0 thanks for watching guys you just like
__label__0 this video you can hit that button if
__label__0 you liked it hit like get subscribed so
__label__0 you don't miss any of our CES 2018
__label__0 content and yes pretty much all I got to
__label__0 say this is a sleek little machine it's
__label__0 too bad about that webcam placement
__label__1 fresh books is the number one cloud
__label__1 accounting software a custom built for
__label__1 the way that you want to work for your
__label__1 free unrestricted 30-day trial go to
__label__1 fresh books calm slash Linus CES and
__label__0 speaking of number one this is my
__label__0 favorite case of the show so far it has
__label__0 such beautiful steel that I thought it
__label__0 was aluminum for like a while then
__label__0 there's tempered glass on the front and
__label__0 on the side this front is a really cool
__label__0 custom reservoir by der Bauer who worked
__label__0 in collaboration on this case but the
__label__0 one that you get if you buy it will show
__label__0 up as a clean tempered glass clear front
__label__0 panel ok but why is it that special well
__label__0 the price if you get it with no fans is
__label__0 one $29.99 if you get it with three RGB
__label__0 fans with aluminum frames it's one 59:19
__label__0 all the panels on this case are tooless
__label__0 although to remove them you'll have to
__label__0 remove the top one first it has two
__label__0 captive thumb screws on the back that
__label__0 you can just slide it back and lift it
__label__0 right off for now we're gonna remove the
__label__0 back panel this guy has two big meshed
__label__0 filtered breathing holes this one on the
__label__0 left here is for the radiator that could
__label__0 be attached to the three fans that are
__label__0 in the front and this one on the right
__label__0 hand side is for your power supply and
__label__0 your hard drives but the power supply
__label__0 and hard drive positions can switch
__label__0 around and be changed so you could have
__label__0 two power supplies in here if you wished
__label__0 and you took away this hard drive
__label__0 mounting location or like I expect most
__label__0 people will have it configured is like
__label__0 it is now or with these positions
__label__0 swapped now this hard drive Bay you can
__label__0 access them through the back through
__label__0 this little panel that's back here it's
__label__0 just one more thumb screw which can be
__label__0 two lessly removed and then you can
__label__0 actually slide out the trays through the
__label__0 back so everything is nicely accessible
__label__0 well we're back here I'd like to draw
__label__0 attention to this large plate in the
__label__0 middle you can mount one three and a
__label__0 half inch drive up here or one two and a
__label__0 half inch drive and a little bit lower
__label__0 down you can mount also another two and
__label__0 a half inch drive those drives would go
__label__0 on the inside so you actually close the
__label__0 case but you can remove the plate with
__label__0 the two screws up here or one screw down
__label__0 here in order to mount those drives
__label__0 before you put it inside and it doubles
__label__0 as a way to hide your potential cable
__label__0 mess if you decided to be a little bit
__label__0 lazy in terms of front i/o you have a
__label__0 power button two USB three type-a ports
__label__0 a headphone
__label__0 microphone jack and USB type-c port and
__label__0 that is all mounted onto a brushed
__label__0 aluminum plate which is great because
__label__0 all the areas that you're really going
__label__0 to be focusing on when you look at this
__label__0 case the front and the inside are
__label__0 covered by tempered glass and aluminum I
__label__0 mentioned earlier how you could buy the
__label__0 O 11 dynamic with three RGB fans
__label__0 included that brings us to their update
__label__0 of their Borah line of fans we're gonna
__label__0 start with the Borah plus 120 a three
__label__0 kit of these with their addressable RGB
__label__0 version which you can control through
__label__0 their custom software with a whole bunch
__label__0 of different lighting modes including
__label__0 CPU usage levels CPU temperature levels
__label__0 drive temperatures and a ton of other
__label__0 stuff is $99 for the three fan kit and
__label__0 the controller now if you step down from
__label__0 there get the same three awesome fans
__label__0 but it's you it's managed by an external
__label__0 physical controller that's $69.99 for
__label__0 the three fans and the controller and
__label__0 then if you step down from there again
__label__0 we're not going to low end fans we're
__label__0 just going to a step down from the Borah
__label__0 plus you get what I'm going to call and
__label__0 they've been kind of saying around here
__label__0 the Borah light but that is not the
__label__0 official name for it and that's this guy
__label__0 I actually personally to possibly their
__label__0 dismay think that it might look better
__label__0 because the RGB is on the inside the
__label__0 LEDs I should say on the inside are
__label__0 actually hidden by the middle sticker
__label__0 and it looks like the fan is just
__label__0 glowing from nothing which i think is
__label__0 really cool that is managed by your
__label__0 motherboard through just a simple PWM
__label__0 connector and is $39 for three of them
__label__0 the O 11 dynamic and the new Borah fans
__label__0 are both cheaper than I expected much
__label__0 more affordable than I expected I
__label__0 thought this case was going to be closer
__label__1 to 200 $250 speaking of affordability
__label__1 and managing money fresh books is the
__label__1 number one cloud accounting software so
__label__1 if you need to manage your invoices
__label__1 create invoices in 30 seconds or less
__label__1 see if your customers have seen your
__label__1 invoices or not take online payments all
__label__1 that easy to use kind of stuff so you
__label__1 can actually focus on running your
__label__1 business and doing things like building
__label__1 computers or making terrible terrible
__label__1 segues into sponsor spots you can
__label__1 actually just run fresh books and your
__label__1 whole life will be more simple go to

__label__0 the rest of our CES content and I will

__label__0 better a segue next time
__label__0 so there's this fantastic Wikipedia list
__label__0 descriptively titled Wikipedia : unusual
__label__0 articles I just remembered as that
__label__0 Wikipedia list it's a collection of
__label__0 hundreds of articles about unusual
__label__0 unexpected and unbelievable subjects no
__label__0 matter what link you click it's bound to
__label__0 be interesting for that reason every
__label__0 week I'm going to click on a new link
__label__0 and teach you a little bit more about
__label__0 our amazing world maps are very hard to
__label__0 make to create a map from scratch 1s two
__label__0 years of fieldwork er analyzation of
__label__0 satellite photos so plagiarism has
__label__0 always been rampant among map makers
__label__0 it's pretty easy just to redraw the same
__label__0 geographical features from one map on to
__label__0 a new map and it's hard to get caught
__label__0 you are after all drawing the exact same
__label__0 world so map makers came up with a way
__label__0 to catch individuals stealing their data
__label__0 this is Argyll tynin West Lancashire
__label__0 England according to a 2009 screenshot
__label__0 of Google Maps Argyll tin is a town it's
__label__0 supposedly located between autumn to the
__label__0 south and Ormskirk to the north the
__label__0 problem is if you go to this site this
__label__0 is what you find the Argyll tenue
__label__0 paper towns are fake places that are put
__label__0 on maps as copyright traps a map maker
__label__0 can make up a place and if they see that
__label__0 a competing map maker also has that town
__label__0 on their maps they know that at one
__label__0 point the competitor plagiarized their
__label__0 info so in Argyll Tain's case the town
__label__0 probably wasn't placed there by Google
__label__0 Google gets their data from tella Atlas
__label__0 who sources their data from other
__label__0 mapping companies who in turn get some
__label__0 of their data from other mapping
__label__0 companies somewhere down the line
__label__0 someone must have place Argyll tanaan
__label__0 the map as a trap and its presence on
__label__0 Google Maps was just a remnant of that
__label__0 after the fake town gained widespread
__label__0 media attention who were removed it from
__label__0 their map and it has since been replaced
__label__0 with a marker designating the spot as a
__label__0 ghost town there are hundreds of other
__label__0 examples of Paper Towns in New York a
__label__0 spot north of Roscoe New York was marked
__label__0 as the town of aglow by the general
__label__0 drafting company in 1930 the name came
__label__0 from an anagram of the cartographers
__label__0 initials and appeared on numerous maps
__label__0 since its conception in the 1960s a glow
__label__0 showed up on a Ranma Canali map of the
__label__0 region and thinking they had fallen into
__label__0 their trap
__label__0 Esso who had bought the map from the
__label__0 general drafting company threatened to
__label__0 sue McNally the suit was dropped though
__label__0 when Rand McNally pointing that aglow
__label__0 had actually become a real place
__label__0 sometime in the 1950s locals opened up a
__label__0 general store north of Roscoe New York
__label__0 and after looking at an Esso map of the
__label__0 region decided to call their store the
__label__0 aglow general store there for making a
__label__0 glow an official place the store
__label__0 eventually went out of business and the
__label__0 town is censuses appear for most Maps
__label__0 but this is one instance where a fake
__label__0 town
__label__0 real a similar idea of Paper Towns has
__label__0 been used in other domains in 2001 the
__label__0 word equivalents appeared in the New
__label__0 Oxford American Dictionary defined as
__label__0 the willful avoidance of one's official
__label__0 responsibilities that word was made up
__label__0 as a copyright trap and it actually
__label__0 worked
__label__0 dictionary.com and gules dictionary both
__label__0 added a listing for the word equivalents
__label__0 possibly proving a level of plagiarism
__label__0 among the online dictionaries
__label__0 occasionally unintentional traps are
__label__0 created that prove effective before they
__label__0 created Apple Maps Apple was making maps
__label__0 on a much smaller scale for iPhoto these
__label__0 maps had no attributions and therefore
__label__0 no one could be sure where their data
__label__0 was from but there were some obvious
__label__0 clues this screenshot of Apple's map of
__label__0 Norwich shows an area of disorganized
__label__0 roads in the Northeast if you look at
__label__0 the OpenStreetMap map of the area you
__label__0 can see that these rows are actually
__label__0 trails in a park overlaying the Apple
__label__0 map over the OSM map of the area you can
__label__0 see how perfectly the suppose it road
__label__0 and trails line up you can assume from
__label__0 this that Apple took their map data from
__label__0 Open Street Map and mistook the trails
__label__0 for roads a few months after the release
__label__0 Apple officially credit Open Street Map
__label__0 for their contributions to the maps
__label__0 confirming that they use OSM's data
__label__0 so those are Paper Towns I hope you
__label__0 enjoyed this week's episode I'll be back
__label__0 next week to bring you more from that
__label__0 Wikipedia list
__label__1 thank you a tunnel better for sponsoring
__label__1 this video at CES 2018 tunnel bear makes
__label__1 very easy to use privacy apps for the
__label__1 Internet so that you can enjoy a more
__label__1 open Internet to try it out for free go
__label__1 to tella bear comm slash LTT we're here
__label__0 at Thermaltake checking out their view
__label__0 37 case first thing your to notice other
__label__0 than that it just looks amazing in its
__label__0 current configuration at CES is these
__label__0 huge 200 millimeter fans behind the
__label__0 acrylic in the front of the case this
__label__0 won't come with the case the standard or
__label__0 the upgraded RGB version but you'll be
__label__0 able to add them yourself if you want to
__label__0 have a different configuration than
__label__0 these 200 millimeter fans up in the
__label__0 front you can have up to three 120
__label__0 millimeter fans or two 140 millimeter
__label__0 fans moving inside the case from there
__label__0 you can see this awesome radiator that's
__label__0 mounted on the right hand side you could
__label__0 set up this current configuration with
__label__0 three 120 millimeter fans or go down to
__label__0 two or one and then in the back there's
__label__0 a 140 millimeter fan placed there
__label__0 currently that should come with both
__label__0 versions of the case that you could buy
__label__0 but it would be a different fan than the
__label__0 one that's currently in here but you
__label__0 could tone that down to 120 if you
__label__0 wanted in terms of where all these crazy
__label__0 fans are gonna actually breathe from
__label__0 because you see this huge acrylic panel
__label__0 on the front and this nice curved
__label__0 acrylic panel on the side the front ones
__label__0 will breathe in through the side there's
__label__0 grills along there they're fairly large
__label__0 that won't give them the most amount of
__label__0 airflow but it is a huge amount of fans
__label__0 that you can mount there so it should
__label__0 breathe pretty okay and this radiator
__label__0 placement just on the inside of the case
__label__0 should be able to breathe super easily
__label__0 as it has its own cutout in the back so
__label__0 the huge fans in the front are able to
__label__0 feed both the back fan and the radiator
__label__0 fans that are just mounted on the inside
__label__0 and just in front of the power supply if
__label__0 you do go with the vertical GPU mount
__label__0 you can see here in this current
__label__0 configuration that they have the pump
__label__0 and the reservoir mounted very nicely
__label__0 right behind there so you can have a
__label__0 whole bunch of really tight nice water
__label__0 cooling setups like they have with their
__label__0 hardline in terms of front IO they have
__label__0 an RGB button for changing color modes
__label__0 they have two USB 3 ports two USB to
__label__0 ports headphone and microphone jacks a
__label__0 power button and an activity LED so if
__label__0 you think that setup looked great and
__label__0 you want to emulate something like that
__label__0 or do something in another case whatever
__label__0 brand it may be you could pick up one of
__label__0 their water
__label__0 Kitt's if you're worried about doing
__label__0 water cooling if maybe it's your first
__label__0 time and you want everything handled for
__label__0 you you can pick up anything in their
__label__0 range right here they have an m240 which
__label__0 is a 240 millimeter rad and it's more a
__label__0 little bit simple compared to the other
__label__0 ones there's no crazy RGB or anything
__label__0 going on there you can move up to an M
__label__0 360 which has more RGB going on it's a
__label__0 360 radiator it's a little bit more
__label__0 full-featured and then if you want to go
__label__0 absolutely crazy with a radiator that
__label__0 has RGB on it with a water block that
__label__0 has RGB on it with a reservoir that has
__label__0 RGB on it just full balls-to-the-wall
__label__0 and even more fittings all of these come
__label__0 with right angle fittings too which is
__label__0 cool you're gonna be set up for hardline
__label__0 water cooling and pretty much whatever
__label__0 situation you're gonna have it will all
__label__0 be taken care of for you and a hard line
__label__0 is a little bit of a scary thing for
__label__0 some people to get into so this setup
__label__0 will help you get started in that scary
__label__0 arena of water cooling at all and the
__label__0 advanced difficulty of hardline and more
__label__0 in that vein all of these kits come with
__label__0 clear liquid but if you want to change
__label__0 the color of the liquid you could pick
__label__0 up one of thermal takes of different
__label__0 various colored dyes or use really any
__label__1 dye for that matter speaking of making
__label__1 things easier you can use tunnel Bayer
__label__1 to create a VPN for you and it's all
__label__1 simple you don't have to do any router
__label__1 settings you know if you do a firewall
__label__1 settings you just turn on the app the
__label__1 Bayer tunnels you to whatever server
__label__1 location you want and it's all done it's
__label__1 all handled your privacy is secure
__label__1 they'll help protect you against people
__label__1 that are trying to profit off of your
__label__1 data because it will protect from that
__label__1 and did I mention it's free go to tell
__label__1 Barry comm l / LT t and they'll take
__label__1 care of it for you you like this video
__label__0 like it you just like this video just
__label__0 like it get subscribed to see all the
__label__0 rest of our CES content and I'll see you
__label__0 around
__label__0 [Music]
__label__1 this video from tes 2018 is brought to
__label__1 you by D brand makers of sick skins for
__label__1 your mobile devices game consoles and
__label__1 controllers check him out at V Francom
__label__1 clash des 2018 so over in monitor land
__label__0 the big focus for LG this year is nano
__label__0 cell IPS displays boasting up to 500
__label__0 nits peak brightness and HDR 10 support
__label__0 with 98% coverage at the DCI p3 color
__label__0 space they're showing off a 5k
__label__0 ultra-wide that's a first with
__label__0 Thunderbolt 3 input as well as display
__label__0 point input and finally LG freaking
__label__0 finally a g-sync
__label__0 34 inch 120 Hertz gaming display so
__label__0 that's about 20% faster than a sir's
__label__0 predator x 34 but I got distracted from
__label__0 the monitors and I ended up over here
__label__0 because already they are replacing the
__label__0 Graham
__label__0 that we just reviewed we just reviewed
__label__0 the core 8 gen Graham actually yeah
__label__0 James is using what we just got this
__label__0 like like a month ago and we were like
__label__0 okay this is a great laptop it's super
__label__0 light it's got great battery it's
__label__0 quad-core now which is flippin sick up
__label__0 to 16 gigs ram except for a few small
__label__0 issues the webcam is here which is kind
__label__0 of a bummer the fingerprint sensor
__label__0 certain biometrics is great but it's
__label__0 here which is kind of a bummer and this
__label__0 type C port isn't Thunderbolt so you
__label__0 just can't run it with an external
__label__0 graphics card well you know what this
__label__0 one is all of this is the buyer's
__label__0 remorse model because it's got a bigger
__label__0 battery than ever before the same
__label__0 structurally reinforced chassis it's got
__label__0 the touch sensor for your fingerprint
__label__0 built into the power button now so you
__label__0 have your full trackpad to use it's got
__label__0 a core I know what was the other thing
__label__0 oh yes it's got the webcam moved up to
__label__0 the top yes and finally Thunderbolt
__label__0 support on the ground so that means high
__label__0 speed external peripherals that means
__label__0 external graphics making it far more
__label__0 competitive
__label__0 with the blade stealth quad-core that I
__label__0 have been reading off of under the lens
__label__0 sorry to break the illusion there and
__label__0 basically I cannot wait to get my hands
__label__0 on this and run it through the paces
__label__0 because the one thing we're LG can lose
__label__0 to the blade stealth here is in max
__label__0 turbo speeds that's going to hurt their
__label__0 gaming performance compared to the
__label__0 blades belt if they haven't improved
__label__0 that since date here we go last gen
__label__0 Graham the last gen a month ago Graham
__label__1 so thanks to D Bren for sponsoring this
__label__1 video guys check them out over at D

__label__1 let them know in the comments if you
__label__1 want to see a grand skin because I sure
__label__1 do
__label__0 that'd be great thanks so guys you can
__label__0 dislike you can like you can subscribe
__label__0 to you miss any of our CES 2018 content
__label__0 and we will see you at the next one
__label__1 this video from CES 2018 is brought to
__label__1 by squarespace built an awesome website
__label__1 or store with their all-in-one platform
__label__1 today at the link below so we're here in
__label__0 the Synoptics booth at CES 2018 so you
__label__0 might know synaptics for their I don't
__label__0 know fingerprint sensors touch pads all
__label__0 that kind of stuff if it's a sensor
__label__0 they're probably into it but fingerprint
__label__0 sensors are actually the one we're most
__label__0 interested in right now so this right
__label__0 here is the first phone I have ever laid
__label__0 my hands and/or fingers on with an in
__label__0 screen fingerprint sensor it's using the
__label__0 synaptics clear ID FS 9500 and if you
__label__0 haven't heard of that before well the
__label__0 reason is that it is not out yet
__label__0 now this phone is set to launch in early
__label__0 2018 they won't give us a ton of
__label__0 information about it but what we do know
__label__0 is that it uses a six point four inch
__label__0 OLED panel it's got a dual camera setup
__label__0 on the back that was actually pretty
__label__0 snappy but we can't evaluate the image
__label__0 quality in a setting like this it's got
__label__0 a pretty clean black and gold overall
__label__0 design and on the bottom you'll find on
__label__0 microUSB that was a little disappointing
__label__0 but thankfully a headphone jack the star
__label__0 of the show really is the display though
__label__0 it uses a Samsung OLED panel probably a
__label__0 good choice there and like any phone
__label__0 these days that display is kind of like
__label__0 a cake or an onion it's got layers you
__label__0 know so what happens here is there's a
__label__0 glass digitizer that's on top then
__label__0 there's an OLED panel with its substrate
__label__0 and then there are actually little holes
__label__0 that allow light from the panel to
__label__0 bounce off of your finger and through to
__label__0 the sensor underneath it reading your
__label__0 fingerprint now the speed is not as fast
__label__0 as something like an iPhone 8 but it's
__label__0 also not as slow as some of the early
__label__0 generation touch sensors so I didn't
__label__0 feel like there was really any
__label__0 compromise that I was making in using it
__label__0 now the question you guys are probably
__label__0 all thinking right now why has he not
__label__0 talked about this yet
__label__0 is can you see it and the answer is
__label__0 yes but with a gigantic asterisk because
__label__0 the only time you can see it and I had
__label__0 to look pretty closely even under the
__label__0 powerful lights in here on a black
__label__0 background the only time you can see it
__label__0 is kind of at an angle like this by the
__label__0 time you get to a normal viewing angle
__label__0 and we're talking like that still it
__label__0 disappears completely and on a white
__label__0 background I couldn't I can't oh oh
__label__0 there it is okay barely you can barely
__label__0 make it out at all so this is really
__label__1 freaking impressive and you know what
__label__1 else is impressive Squarespace you can
__label__1 create a beautiful website or online
__label__1 store with one of their award-winning
__label__1 templates today and the great thing is
__label__1 no matter what kind of bugs are you know
__label__1 discovered in CPUs haha your website
__label__1 will perform well with no downtime no
__label__1 patching no updates nothing like that
__label__1 Squarespace takes care of all of it
__label__1 they've got award-winning 24/7 customer
__label__1 support and they're used by a wide range
__label__1 of creatives and people including
__label__1 musicians designers artists restaurants
__label__1 and more so try it out today at first
__label__1 base comm slash LTT and you can get 10%
__label__1 off on your first purchase so thanks for
__label__0 watching guys you dislike this video
__label__0 then you clearly hate technology because
__label__0 like with completely all display phones
__label__0 being basically the freaking future this
__label__0 is kind of an important development but
__label__0 if you liked it hit like get subscribed
__label__0 so you don't miss any of our CES content
__label__0 and we will see you at the next booth
__label__1 this portion of our CES coverage is
__label__1 brought to you by LastPass check out the
__label__1 link in the video description to learn
__label__1 more and start securing your passwords
__label__0 today we are here in the Lenovo suite
__label__0 where they are showing off their latest
__label__0 ThinkPad x1 carbon it's got some pretty
__label__0 significant spec upgrades first and
__label__0 foremost of which is an 810 core
__label__0 processor yes my friends we are talking
__label__0 quad core in a tiny lightweight laptop
__label__0 like this it can be equipped with up to
__label__0 16 gigs of RAM up to a one terabyte MDOT
__label__0 to drive and it's got a ton of other
__label__0 great features built into it as well
__label__0 it's available with Windows hello facial
__label__0 recognition as well as you know
__label__0 fingerprint sensors for plebs it's got a
__label__0 shutter to hide the webcam sort of maybe
__label__0 we'll get to that later it's available
__label__0 with up to 8 500 nits peak brightness
__label__0 1440p display and there's another option
__label__0 with touch and this premium display
__label__0 option has a hundred percent Adobe RGB
__label__0 coverage and it is factory calibrated
__label__0 they've actually tuned the display for
__label__0 Dolby vision and in terms of the
__label__0 performance it is somewhere near the HDR
__label__0 400 spec which is kind of like guy it's
__label__0 like sort of related to HDR 10 but that
__label__0 would be like that thousand so it's like
__label__0 HDR thousand is a thousand its peak
__label__0 brightness and then there's like 600 and
__label__0 400 the actual value of it is sort of
__label__0 debatable but it'll understand an HDR
__label__0 signal let's put it that way it's got
__label__0 support for Dolby Atmos and the keyboard
__label__0 is characteristic of Lenovo pretty darn
__label__0 solid with everything you could want in
__label__0 terms of inputs you got the nipple you
__label__0 got the buttons and you've got the
__label__0 touchpad IO is not disappointing
__label__0 actually you can't say that about a lot
__label__0 of modern devices so we've got a three
__label__0 and a half millimeter jack we've got a
__label__0 USB a on that side we've got another USB
__label__0 a we've got an HDMI output we've got two
__label__0 Thunderbolt ports with four PCIe lanes
__label__0 each and an Ethernet jack but it's like
__label__0 this weird proprietary form factor cord
__label__0 I had to ask I was like why do you need
__label__0 an Ethernet jack why isn't it just too
__label__0 tight see if it's got to plug into your
__label__0 dock which has a bunch of other i/o in
__label__0 it
__label__0 the answer was actually really smart
__label__0 it's so that your MAC address doesn't
__label__0 change that's great for corporate
__label__0 clients when you plug into your dock and
__label__0 you want to access your VPN or whatever
__label__0 it's got integrated 4G LTE and 57 watt
__label__0 hour battery Cortana support now let's
__label__0 get into the things that I'm like super
__label__0 disappointed about so the premium 1440p
__label__0 panel not available with touch Thank You
__label__0 panel makers the IR camera it's not
__label__0 compatible with the cover and the IR
__label__0 camera version is not available with the
__label__0 premium panel so it's like man it's like
__label__0 so close to being like basically perfect
__label__0 maybe next year maybe next year feel
__label__0 like I say that a lot it's gonna start
__label__0 at 1709 that is that is a weird weird
__label__0 price point but you know it's not at a
__label__0 weird price point
__label__1 LastPass LastPass is a great value if
__label__1 you're looking for a way to keep track
__label__1 of securely your passwords and other
__label__1 credentials or even just little notes
__label__1 that you want to make to yourself or

__label__1 it allows us to log into social accounts
__label__1 or get access to online assets like
__label__1 Shutterstock without having to do a
__label__1 password reset or call someone to get a
__label__1 password or heaven forbid be texting

__label__1 each other it's just one password you
__label__1 have to remember it supports two-factor
__label__1 authentication for additional security
__label__1 and you can get access to everything you
__label__1 need whether you're an individual with
__label__1 LastPass premium you're a small team
__label__1 with LastPass teens or even a large
__label__1 enterprise with LastPass Enterprise so
__label__1 go check it out try it out we've got it
__label__1 linked in the video description we've
__label__1 been using it a long time we've been
__label__0 super happy so thanks for watching guys
__label__0 you can dislike this video if your like
__label__0 mean or you can press like get
__label__0 subscribed and make sure you don't miss
__label__0 any of our CES 2018 content
__label__1 thank you a tunnel better for sponsoring
__label__1 this video at CES 2018 tunnel bear makes
__label__1 very easy to use privacy apps for the
__label__1 Internet so that you can enjoy a more
__label__1 open Internet to try it out for free go
__label__1 to telomere comma slash LT t we're here
__label__0 checking out wallet card they're the
__label__0 same size and physical feel as a normal
__label__0 credit card they're still waterproof
__label__0 they're still resistant to tears as
__label__0 they're made out of plastic but you
__label__0 might notice the ePaper display and the
__label__0 left and right buttons on the side you
__label__0 might be wondering why well the wallet
__label__0 card can store up to 100 credit cards
__label__0 within itself the arrow keys are for
__label__0 switching between the cards the ePaper
__label__0 display is for displaying what card you
__label__0 currently have selected it is worth
__label__0 noting however that you can't mix banks
__label__0 and networks on the same wallet card so
__label__0 if you have like a Bank of America visa
__label__0 and a TD MasterCard they can't be on the
__label__0 same wallet card but if you had a USD
__label__0 and a CAD and a rewards card all from
__label__0 the same bank say TD or whatever else
__label__0 that could all be on one wallet card
__label__0 it's all handled for you
__label__0 the cards are added to wallet card over
__label__0 the same secure network that credit
__label__0 cards use right now it's powered by
__label__0 movements in the same way that
__label__0 self-winding watches are so it's never
__label__0 gonna die when you switch cards the tap
__label__0 mag stripe and chip payment methods all
__label__0 automatically switch with it there's
__label__0 even a cellular connection so if you
__label__0 lose the card it can be wiped remotely
__label__0 in the bill for the cellular connection
__label__0 is being footed by your bank although
__label__0 I'm sure that will trickle down to some
__label__0 cost for you at somewhere along the
__label__0 chain another option more based around
__label__0 just one card but with advanced security
__label__0 is well their security card in addition
__label__0 to your standard four digit PIN they
__label__0 have a 12 digit PIN based on one two
__label__0 three four and five the physical input
__label__0 keys on the card this will make it so
__label__0 that you can't even do any form of
__label__0 payments unless the pin has been entered
__label__0 and it won't even show the number for
__label__0 the card on the front unless you enter
__label__0 those digits as well I also wouldn't
__label__0 worry about brute force as by default
__label__0 you can only attempt the access code up
__label__0 to eight times before the card locks up
__label__0 and locks new out
__label__0 go to the bank and get it unlocked very
__label__0 cool security feature for someone who
__label__0 might lose the card as you don't really
__label__0 have to worry that much about losing it
__label__0 anymore it's a code for your credit card
__label__0 is hidden and you can't access it and
__label__1 it's immune to brute force go speaking
__label__1 of making things easier you can use
__label__1 tunnel bear to create a VPN for you and
__label__1 it's all simple you don't have to do any
__label__1 router settings you know if you're doing
__label__1 firewall settings you just turn on the
__label__1 app the bear tunnels you to whatever
__label__1 server location you want and it's all
__label__1 done it's all handled your privacy is
__label__1 secure they'll help protect you against
__label__1 people that are trying to profit off of
__label__1 your data because it will protect from
__label__1 that and did I mention it's free go to
__label__1 tunnel bear comm L flash LTT and they'll
__label__1 take care of it for you thank you for
__label__0 watching this video if you liked it like
__label__0 it if you just liked it dislike to get
__label__0 subscribed to see all the rest of our so
__label__0 yes we 18 content and I'll see you next
__label__0 time
__label__0 with my super secure credit cards
__label__0  This is "Every state in the US" by Wendover Productions, made possible by The Great ...
__label__0  ... Courses Plus.
__label__0  We start with Alabama, the first is in alphabetical order.
__label__0  Magnolia Springs, Alabama is the only state in America where mail is delivered per ...
__label__0  ... boat, although the longest postal route in America is in the Oklahoma countryside, where the ...
__label__0  ... drivers have to drive 301.9 kilometers a day to bring the mail to about 200 homes.
__label__0  The official vegetable of Oklahoma is the watermelon, which happens to be fruit. Oklahoma is ...
__label__0  ... Kansas, the city.
__label__0  The real Kansas, or more specifically this dot, is the geographical center of the continental ...
__label__0  ...United States.
__label__0  What is not in Kansas, Kansas City. That is where you would not expect, in Missouri, the state with ...
__label__0  ... the population center of the USA - the average location of every American.
__label__0  Missouri borders eight states, and thus equates with Tennessee as the state bordering on ...
__label__0  ... most other states.
__label__0  Tennessee was a southern state that separated from the United States and joined the Confederation ...
__label__0  ... with the exception of Scott County, which came from Tennessee and ...
__label__0  ... was an unrecognized, independent state.
__label__0  Scott County actually officially returned to Tennessee in 1986.
__label__0  The western border of Tennessee was originally formed by the Mississippi River, ...
__label__0  ... that has since changed course, leading to all these enclaves and exclaves of ...
__label__0  ... the two states on both sides of the river.
__label__0  The Arkansas River, a major tributary of the Mississippi, starts all the way to Colorado, ...
__label__0  where nobody knows for sure which mountain is the highest, Mount Elbert or Mount Massive.
__label__0  Their heights vary less than 3 meters and the people stay piles ...
__label__0  ... laying stones on the mountain tops, to make one higher than the other.
__label__0  In Colorado is also the longest continuous street of America, Colfax Avenue in Denver.
__label__0  The street is 42 kilometers long. But as the shortest street with a name in America, is called McKinley Street, ...
__label__0  ... in Bellefontiane, Ohio, with a length of only 8.5 meters.
__label__0  The northernmost point of Ohio is more northerly than the southernmost point of Canada, Pelee Island.
__label__0  Canada's Pelee Island is even more southerly than places in 27 other states, including California.
__label__0  California has a larger population than the whole of Canada.
__label__0  Although Los Angeles, California is located on the Pacific Ocean, the city lies more east than six states capitals, ...
__label__0  ... including Nevada.
__label__0  In Nevada, the point where you are farthest from a McDonald's is anywhere in the United States, ...
__label__0  ... still only 187 kilometers. But Nevada is not the state with the least number of McDonald's.
__label__0  That title goes to the state with 29 McDonalds: North Dakota, which according to some legal
__label__0  experts until 2012 was not a real state, because their constitution ...
__label__0  ... lacked sense, which meant that the state did not meet the federal requirements for a state.
__label__0  Although North Dakota has the least McDonald's, it is not the state with the lowest number of inhabitants.
__label__0  That's Wyoming, ...
__label__0  ... with only two pairs of escalators in the entire state.
__label__0  Wyoming is known for Yellowstone National Park, although part of it is ...
__label__0  ... Idaho lies, but in that part you can commit murder with impunity.
__label__0  That's right: the sixth amendment demands that if you have to go to court, you ...
__label__0  ... judged by a jury of equals, ie: people from the same state and the same federal ...
__label__0  ... district where the crime was committed.
__label__0  Yellowstone is a federal district in its own right, which means that you need people from Yellowstone to ...
__label__0  ... to form a jury. But if you're in the Idaho part of Yellowstone, you have Yellowstone residents ...
__label__0  ... from Idaho needed for the jury. But this area of ​​130 square kilometers is completely uninhabited, ...
__label__0  ... which means that no jury can be formed and you therefore go free.
__label__0  There is only one road that connects the whole south of Idaho with the ...
__label__0  ... northern part.
__label__0  Idaho, with its relatively low population, has only one area code for the whole ...
__label__0  ... is just like the neighboring Montana.
__label__0  In Montana is the least crowded commercial airport in the USA: Dawson Community Airport, with ...
__label__0  ... 4000 passengers per year, or about 11 per day.
__label__0  In Missoula, Montana is the warehouse of DFTBA, where you can buy these things:
__label__0  a Wendover Productions t-shirt, for only $ 20.
__label__0  The link can be found in the description.
__label__0  Atlanta is the busiest airport in America, with 49 million passengers a year, or 135,000 ...
__label__0  ...per day.
__label__0  Peachtree, a suburb of Atlanta, is a place with 145 kilometers of roads especially for golf carts.
__label__0  That comes on top of the ordinary roads, because 9,000 households here have a golf cart as their second car.
__label__0  Children are even encouraged to go to school with their golf cart from the age of twelve.
__label__0  Georgia, or more precisely: Springer Mountain, Georgia, is the beginning of the more than 3,500 kilometers ...
__label__0  ... Appalachian Trail, a hiking trail that ends at Mount Katahdin, ...
__label__0  ... in Maine.
__label__0  Maine is the only state in America that borders only one other state. It is also...
__label__0  ... the state closest to Africa. Really: it is closer than Florida.
__label__0  The state closest to Africa after Maine is Massachusetts. Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to be precise.
__label__0  That is actually an island, given a channel that separates it from the mainland.
__label__0  Massachusetts is further from Miami than Panama City. And Miami is closer to ...
__label__0  the national capitals Nassau, Bahamas and Havana, Cuba, then the own capital of Florida: Tallahassee.
__label__0  Florida's highest point is lower than any other state: 95 meters, 23 times lower than ...
__label__0  ... highest point in South Dakota.
__label__0  In South Dakota lies the geographical center of the complete United States, including Alaska ...
__label__0  ... and Hawaii. South Dakota became a state only 9 days before Washington, which ...
__label__0  ... Columbia was called before it became a state.
__label__0  The name was changed to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, but that has ...
__label__0  ... clearly not helped, because the city in the DC was eventually also called Washington.
__label__0  Washington Place is the official residence of the governor of Hawaii, the state that has its own ...
__label__0  ... currency was given during the Second World War, so that, if ...
__label__0  ... the Japanese could successfully invade the Hawaii, the federal government the money ...
__label__0  of Hawaii as worthless, so that the Japanese would have nothing to do with it.
__label__0  The state closest to Hawaii is Alaska. The capital there, Juneau, has no roads that the city ...
__label__0  ... connecting with the rest of Alaska or North America, which means you can not drive in or out.
__label__0  Alaska is also one of the four states with a complete ban on billboards, just like ...
__label__0  ... Hawaii, Maine and Vermont, where the tallest building only has eleven floors.
__label__0  That is the lowest tallest building in all states.
__label__0  The highest building of all states is the Freedom Tower in New York.
__label__0  Ellis Island, or at least part of it, is located in New York.
__label__0  The area is completely surrounded by New Jersey, just like Liberty Island, where ...
__label__0  the Statue of Liberty is standing, which is completely surrounded by the waters of New Jersey. That means...
__label__0  ... that you have to go through New Jersey to go from New York to New York.
__label__0  On Clinton Road, in West Milford, New Jersey, is the traffic light that is the longest on red in America: at least ...
__label__0  ...five minutes.
__label__0  New Jersey runs surprisingly far to the south: beyond ...
__label__0  ... the northernmost point of Kentucky.
__label__0  In the southwest corner of Kentucky is a large part that actually ...
__label__0  ... is not connected to the rest of Kentucky.
__label__0  Kentucky is the birthplace of Lincoln, which was later chosen as the House of ...
__label__0  Delegates from Illinois. In Illinois is the original burger king, but not the Burger King where you ...
__label__0  ... thinking about it.
__label__0  This citizen king existed for this Burger King and therefore complained to Burger King when that ...
__label__0  ... came to Illinois, due to trademark infringement. Burger king won, so now no Burger King can open ...
__label__0  ... within a distance of 32 kilometers from the original burger king.
__label__0  Chicago, Illinois, the third largest city in America, is only a little bit bigger than ...
__label__0  ... the number four: Houston, Texas. Texas is so big that El Paso, Texas is closer to ...
__label__0  ... Los Angeles is at Houston, Texas.
__label__0  The northernmost point of Texas is closer to Michigan than to the southernmost ...
__label__0  ...point.
__label__0  From Detroit, Michigan, you end up in Canada when you drive straight south. Michigan...
__label__0  ... is also the only state that consists of two completely separated parts.
__label__0  Highway 185 in Michigan is actually a cycle path, which makes it the only official highway in ...
__label__0  ... America that is forbidden for cars.
__label__0  The northern peninsula of Michigan is only connected to Wisconsin by country, the homeland of the ...
__label__0  ... Green Bay Packers, a team that is so popular that the waiting list for season tickets thirty ...
__label__0  ... is for a year.
__label__0  That is so long that it is normal for parents to put their children on the list as soon as ...
__label__0  ... they are born.
__label__0  Watertown, Wisconsin has a Utah street, but the real Utah has the longest stretch of highway ...
__label__0  ... in the US without filling stations: 170 kilometers on the I-70.
__label__0  The I-70 ends more than 3,200 kilometers away in Baltimore, Maryland. The whole state of Maryland ...
__label__0  ... has no natural anymore.
__label__0  It also has this pan stalk, which is 2.9 kilometers wide at the narrowest, before it becomes wider ...
__label__0  ... up to 48 kilometers near West Virginia, which is absolutely a southern state, but ...
__label__0  ... also has a pan stalk that comes out as northerly as New York City and Nebraska.
__label__0  Monowi, Nebraska, is the only official place in the United States with ...
__label__0  an inhabitant.
__label__0  This only resident, Elsie Eiler, is mayor and runs the library and the pub, which every year ...
__label__0  ... get an alcohol license from Elsie herself.
__label__0  Tortilla Flat, Arizona, is six times larger than Monowi: six people live there.
__label__0  Arizona also has a fourth of the 'quadrangle monument', the only point in the US where four states come together ...
__label__0  ... Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, which as a state legally still recognizes that Pluto ...
__label__0  ... is a planet.
__label__0  New Mexico is usually the last state that votes in the presidential primaries, while Iowa ...
__label__0  ... is often the first.
__label__0  Iowa is the only state in the US where both the eastern and western borders consist of water, in this ...
__label__0  ... case rivers.
__label__0  The eastern border is Mississippi, the river that gave its name to the state of Mississippi.
__label__0  The Mississippi river flowed the other way in 2012 during hurricane ...
__label__0  ... Isaac. The river does not actually come out in the ocean in the state of Mississippi.
__label__0  That happens in Louisiana, where the longest bridge over water in the world is, 39 kilometers long.
__label__0  That is so long that you do not even see land for 13 kilometers.
__label__0  Another of the longest bridges in the US is in North Carolina: the Virginia Dare ...
__label__0  ... Memorial Bridge, which brings cars to Kitty Hawk, where the Wright Brothers succeeded ...
__label__0  ... to fly an airplane heavier than air for the first time in history.
__label__0  The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 37 meters, shorter than the width of wings on a Boeing 747.
__label__0  The southern neighbor of North Carolina is South Carolina, although that state ...
__label__0  ... not at all so south. More than half is located north of the southernmost point of North Carolina.
__label__0  South Carolina also has a place called North, or: North, South Carolina.
__label__0  In South Carolina the first battle in the Civil War was fought. The Civil War knew ...
__label__0  ... one battle in Indiana, where the Indy 500 race course is located. That's so gigantic ...
__label__0  ... that the whole country of Vatican City would fit in easily.
__label__0  There are also 400,000 people, which is the highest number for a sports arena ...
__label__0  ...in the world.
__label__0  The official drink of the state of Indiana is water, while that in Oregon is milk.
__label__0  In Portland, Oregon is the world's smallest park, according to the Guinness World ...
__label__0  Records Book: Mill End Park.
__label__0  Oregon is also one of the few states without VAT, just like New Hampshire.
__label__0  That is the only state where adults are not obliged to wear seat belts.
__label__0  Connecticut Lake, in New Hampshire, is the source of the Connecticut River, where ...
__label__0  ... the state of Connecticut is named after.
__label__0  Hartford, Connecticut Airport, with less than 3 million passengers a year, is the smallest ...
__label__0  ... airport in the US with direct flights to Europe.
__label__0  Delaware, by contrast, certainly does not have direct flights to Europe, because it ...
__label__0  ... the only state is where you can not fly at all.
__label__0  There is not one commercial flight to or from this small state.
__label__0  It is the second smallest state after Rhode Island, which is so small that the whole state ...
__label__0  increases by 3 percent at low tide.
__label__0  The second largest city in Rhode Island, Warwick, shares its name with Warwick, Pennsylvania.
__label__0  In Pennsylvania is Centralia, where the ground has been on fire since 1962 thanks to ...
__label__0  ... a fire in a coal mine. The fire is expected to last another 200 years.
__label__0  Pennsylvania borders Minnesota, not really, but Pennsylvania Avenue crosses with Minnesota ...
__label__0  Avenue in DC. Minnesota is the northernmost point of the 48 continental states.
__label__0  It's like this: most of the border between the US and Canada is on the 49th latitude. An error in the land survey ...
__label__0  led here.
__label__0  The few hundred inhabitants of this area, the Northwest Angle, are completely ...
__label__0  ... shut down from the US and have to come back to the US by Canada to ...
__label__0  ... to go to school.
__label__0  Virginia is also the village in northern Minnesota. Virginia, the state, is gigantic.
__label__0  So large, that Ewing, Virginia is closer to the capitals of eight other states than at ...
__label__0  ... the capital Richmond.
__label__0  Alexandria, Virginia is even closer to Toronto, Canada than at Ewing, Virginia.
__label__0  Virginia also extends westward than West Virginia.
__label__0  And in Virginia is this building: the headquarters of the Teaching Company, responsible for ...

__label__0 if you've ever looked at a flight
__label__0 tracker sometime around 10:00 or 11:00
__label__0 p.m. Eastern you might have noticed
__label__0 something perfect lines of planes
__label__0 stretching all the way to Europe these
__label__0 are just some of the over 2000 daily
__label__0 flights that cross the northern Atlantic
__label__0 with so many flights there just has to
__label__0 be organization this is the most direct
__label__0 route from New York to London you may
__label__0 think it's this a straight line but that
__label__0 straight line isn't actually a straight
__label__0 line this curved line is a straight line
__label__0 because despite what some may think the
__label__0 earth is curved from New York to London
__label__0 the curve you see on a flat map isn't
__label__0 too extreme but in the case of a longer
__label__0 flight such as from New York to Bangkok
__label__0 the most direct route is not this but
__label__0 this straight over the North Pole it
__label__0 makes a lot more sense if you look at a
__label__0 North Pole oriented map if you draw the
__label__0 most direct route between Atlanta and
__label__0 London you'll see that it passes over
__label__0 every major East Coast International
__label__0 Airport that means that planes from
__label__0 Atlanta to Europe travel on the exact
__label__0 same route as planes from Charlotte
__label__0 Washington Baltimore Philadelphia New
__label__0 York and Boston all these transatlantic
__label__0 planes typically leave between 6 &amp; 8
__label__0 p.m. Eastern to time their arrival for
__label__0 early morning in Europe that means that
__label__0 there are potentially hundreds of planes
__label__0 all going the exact same route at the
__label__0 exact same time the North Atlantic also
__label__0 has something known as the jet stream
__label__0 these easterly winds average around 110
__label__0 miles per hour and if planes fly in them
__label__0 they can cut hours off their travel time
__label__0 however the winds are only strongest in
__label__0 a line three miles high and 100 miles
__label__0 wide that further concentrates the
__label__0 flights on average an eastbound
__label__0 transatlantic flight from New York to
__label__0 London takes about six hours and 15
__label__0 minutes coming back against the jet
__label__0 stream the same flight takes over seven
__label__0 hours sometimes the winds can be even
__label__0 more active such as on January 8th 2015
__label__0 when British Airways flight 114 flew
__label__0 from New York to London in only five
__label__0 hours and 16 minutes a new record for a
__label__0 commercial subsonic plane on that day
__label__0 the jet stream was blowing over 200
__label__0 miles per hour and the Boeing triple7
__label__0 reached a speed of 745 miles per hour
__label__0 only 16 miles per hour below the sound
__label__0 barrier so when winds can cut an hour
__label__0 off a flight and a triple seven burns
__label__0 2,700 gallons of fuel per hour and jet
__label__0 fuel costs a dollar in 89 cents per
__label__0 gallon
__label__0 that's a 5103 dollar difference
__label__0 between being in the right and the wrong
__label__0 wins hopefully you now see why this is
__label__0 important so there are all these planes
__label__0 that are flying the exact same route but
__label__0 usually that's no problem the busiest
__label__0 route in North America New York to
__label__0 Chicago sees over 100 flights per day
__label__0 leaving as frequently as every five
__label__0 minutes during the morning and evening
__label__0 rush and these planes just fly the most
__label__0 efficient route before the flight route
__label__0 planners file a plan with air traffic
__label__0 control and during the flight
__label__0 they're just directed by air traffic
__label__0 control in a way that keeps some five
__label__0 nautical miles from other planes the
__label__0 difference between New York to Chicago
__label__0 and New York to London is that over the
__label__0 North Atlantic
__label__0 there is no radar you see radar only
__label__0 extends about 250 miles offshore
__label__0 transatlantic planes can be more than a
__label__0 thousand miles from shore that's why
__label__0 every morning the route planner is at
__label__0 Gander air traffic control center in
__label__0 gander Newfoundland published today's
__label__0 North Atlantic tracks the night before
__label__0 every airline that will fly across the
__label__0 Atlantic the following day sends Gander
__label__0 a preferred route message indicating
__label__0 what they think the best route will be
__label__0 for the most part Gander Center follows
__label__0 these requests and creates a set of ten
__label__0 or so routes these tracks attempt to get
__label__0 the most amount of planes on the most
__label__0 efficient route to Europe the tracks are
__label__0 labeled Zulu being the southernmost
__label__0 route Yankee being the second
__label__0 southernmost then x-ray than whiskey and
__label__0 so on and so forth here's how a flight
__label__0 on the tracks works and I'll warn you
__label__0 this is when the video gets technical
__label__0 let's say we're going from New York to
__label__0 Paris around half an hour before
__label__0 scheduled departure the captain talks to
__label__0 normal air traffic control to request
__label__0 clearance for the route up to around
__label__0 Newfoundland Canada in most cases
__label__0 clearance is given and soon after will
__label__0 take off about when the plane crosses
__label__0 the Gulf of st. Lawrence the pilot will
__label__0 request the North Atlantic track that he
__label__0 or she desires
__label__0 here's today's message describing the
__label__0 day's routes over the Atlantic after
__label__0 looking over this the pilot decides to
__label__0 request track whiskey that means that at
__label__0 least for now we'll head towards the
__label__0 Raffin waypoint our oceanic entry point
__label__0 waypoints are fixed spots that are used
__label__0 for flight navigation these are much
__label__0 easier for air traffic control to
__label__0 communicate to pilots than map
__label__0 coordinates when speaking over radio
__label__0 occasionally you'll see some creatively
__label__0 named waypoints just north of Lebanon
__label__0 New Hampshire there's ham burger and
__label__0 fries on approach to Kansas City Airport
__label__0 there's spicy barbeque turkey smoked
__label__0 ribs Boston has two waypoints in support
__label__0 of their sports teams but
__label__0 Cubs and bears some Waypoint names are
__label__0 more somber on the northern approach
__label__0 route to Washington Reagan National
__label__0 Airport just miles away from where a
__label__0 plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11 the
__label__0 waypoints read we will never forget
__label__0 September 11th since the North Atlantic
__label__0 tracks change every day
__label__0 the modem just gives the entry and exit
__label__0 way points and then coordinates for the
__label__0 rabbin between since the track
__label__0 coordinates are pre-programmed into the
__label__0 autopilot before takeoff there's no
__label__0 reason to name them as waypoints since
__label__0 they won't be given over radio in the
__label__0 case of this flight we're requesting
__label__0 track whiskey and more than likely
__label__0 Gander Control Center will give us
__label__0 permission although sometimes they'll
__label__0 tell us to take a different track
__label__0 usually because we're closer to another
__label__0 plane than the minimum separation
__label__0 distance since it's much more difficult
__label__0 to know where planes are over the North
__label__0 Atlantic they're required to be 15
__label__0 minutes separated about 140 miles rather
__label__0 than the normal 5 miles in areas with
__label__0 radar coverage assuming we're granted
__label__0 clearance we'll head towards the RAF and
__label__0 Waypoint and make sure that our
__label__0 satellite communication systems are
__label__0 working then we'll check to see if our
__label__0 high-frequency radio is working a backup
__label__0 in case other communications go down
__label__0 minutes later just after passing RAF and
__label__0 Waypoint the controller will say radar
__label__0 services terminated have a good night
__label__0 and we're on our own
__label__0 all the North Atlantic tracks are
__label__0 pre-loaded onto autopilot so there's
__label__0 really nothing to do except wait when we
__label__0 hit 30 degrees west will enter the
__label__0 shanwick airspace approaching Western
__label__0 Europe we switch our radios to shanwick
__label__0 frequency and fly a few more hours to
__label__0 our oceanic exit point guns away point
__label__0 meaning we've successfully traversed the
__label__0 northern Atlantic I hope you enjoyed

__label__0 productions thanks again for watching
__label__0 and I'll see you soon for another win
__label__0 over productions video
__label__0 this will not be a normal one Nova
__label__0 productions video that's because I'm
__label__0 getting a patreon but first I need to
__label__0 show you why so at 5 a.m. on a recent
__label__0 Saturday morning I woke up left my
__label__0 apartment walked downtown took a bus
__label__0 took a plane took a bus took a train
__label__0 then arrived here an open field it may
__label__0 seem strange I traveled over 200 miles
__label__0 to an open field but this was no
__label__0 ordinary open field this was Argyll ttan
__label__0 a place that was once a story in every
__label__0 major newspaper worldwide now this place
__label__0 may sound familiar to you I talked about
__label__0 it in twl episode 3 Argyll t'nuk cysts
__label__0 but only according to some maps it's a
__label__0 paper town back in the old days mapping
__label__0 companies devoted an enormous amount of
__label__0 resources to just figuring out what
__label__0 existed where they had to survey every
__label__0 physical place map every Road plot every
__label__0 mountain just so they knew what to put
__label__0 on maps some figured out though that
__label__0 they didn't have to go out and survey
__label__0 places they could just copy the
__label__0 information from other maps they were
__label__0 after all mapping the exact same world
__label__0 so in theory there would be no way to
__label__0 tell if they were plagiarizing that's
__label__0 why Paper Towns were created these towns
__label__0 never existed in real life they were
__label__0 just randomly and arbitrarily placed if
__label__0 competing maps suddenly started listing
__label__0 paper towns such as Argyll ttan their
__label__0 source would know and could prove that
__label__0 they were plagiarizing since there's
__label__0 certainly no way that they would get the
__label__0 false information from surveying modern
__label__0 maps are constantly updated and adjusted
__label__0 using new technologies like satellite
__label__0 and GPS but a good amount of information
__label__0 on our 21st century maps comes from
__label__0 centuries old maps modern day companies
__label__0 such as TomTom Intelli Atlas acquired
__label__0 much of their information from slightly
__label__0 older companies who acquired their
__label__0 information from even older companies
__label__0 and so on and so forth so remnants of
__label__0 those 19th and 20th century maps
__label__0 sometimes will show up today
__label__0 Argyll ttan is one of those remnants
__label__0 sometime down the line some company
__label__0 place Argyll tanaan the map as a
__label__0 copyright trap and decade after decade
__label__0 nobody noticed even when it got onto
__label__0 digital maps nobody's actually sure when
__label__0 it got there
__label__0 tella Atlas who sourced mapping
__label__0 information for Google in the region
__label__0 tried to figure out where Argyll
__label__0 Tunisian ate it from but came out
__label__0 inconclusive after it was pointed out
__label__0 that in truth our goal today is just
__label__0 this field Google
__label__0 the town from its listings in the area
__label__0 there's no trace of the paper town that
__label__0 once received worldwide media attention
__label__0 there are no signs no souvenirs nothing
__label__0 even for perhaps the most famous fake
__label__0 town ever so now is when I talk about
__label__0 money if there's no way I'll ever
__label__0 convince you to contribute to my patreon
__label__0 you can go but I do encourage you to
__label__0 hear me out I was able to do such a
__label__0 ridiculous thing as traveling 200 miles
__label__0 to an empty field because of your guys's
__label__0 support of the channel I think this
__label__0 video is much better than the original
__label__0 video I made about our Kelton partially
__label__0 because I was able to go to argl Tintin
__label__0 and I want to do things like that more
__label__0 I've grown enormously and through
__label__0 adsense licensing and freelance this
__label__0 channel is now basically my job I make
__label__0 enough through these sources to support
__label__0 myself but I want this channel to
__label__0 improve that's why I've started this
__label__0 patreon every dollar you give to my
__label__0 patreon will be spent directly on the
__label__0 channel I'm serious about that I will
__label__0 not take a dime of what you contribute
__label__0 I'm even going to release a monthly
__label__0 report showing you where your money went
__label__0 the cool thing about this arrangement is
__label__0 that the two or five or ten dollars you
__label__0 contribute will come right back to you
__label__0 in the form of a better video you will
__label__0 be directly affecting the quality and
__label__0 quantity of when over-production videos
__label__0 there are a couple of things I want to
__label__0 spend this money on as with this argyll
__label__0 Tunisia I think there's value in getting
__label__0 real footage of real places along with
__label__0 doing research and interviews on
__label__0 location some of the money will likely
__label__0 go to travel expenses to get to these
__label__0 places additionally I'd love to hire
__label__0 animators and sound designers and others
__label__0 to improve the quality and quantity of
__label__0 my videos I'm not going to change format
__label__0 I promise you I will always have the
__label__0 same simple clear animations in my
__label__0 videos
__label__0 they'll just be cleaner and smoother so
__label__0 a big part of the money will go to this
__label__0 mad push for better production quality
__label__0 I've tried to create some really
__label__0 rewarding rewards and only $2.00 per
__label__0 video you'll have early access to my
__label__0 videos access to the behind the scenes
__label__0 patreon feed and you can wipe your
__label__0 conscience clean for using adblock at $5
__label__0 you'll get a handwritten letter and
__label__0 stickers sent to wherever you live
__label__0 fifteen dollars gets you into a super
__label__0 secret group chat with me and other
__label__0 high-level supporters and your name will
__label__0 be eternal eyes in the description of
__label__0 all videos you support twenty dollars
__label__0 per video will get you an
__label__0 awesome-looking win over productions
__label__0 t-shirt if there are some higher tiers
__label__0 to
__label__0 I won't go over them here because I know
__label__0 many people will actually use them also
__label__0 just to be clear at whatever tier you
__label__0 support you'll also get the rewards of
__label__0 the lower levels so if you have the
__label__0 means to I would love your support on
__label__0 patreon I don't need this money to keep
__label__0 doing the channel I only want it to
__label__0 improve the channel so thank you and
__label__0 good night
__label__0 following the bombing of Pan Am flight
__label__0 103 over Scotland a deal was reached
__label__0 between Gaddafi of Libya and the British
__label__0 government in which the trial of the
__label__0 accused bombers would happen in a
__label__0 neutral country in return for the
__label__0 extradition of the accused bombers the
__label__0 Netherlands agreed to host the trial and
__label__0 so portion of the Netherlands a former
__label__0 NATO base called Camp Zeist became a
__label__0 piece of Scottish land in the
__label__0 Netherlands this Lane was part of
__label__0 Scotland with Scottish police officers
__label__0 Scottish judges and Scottish law thus
__label__0 the court established on the site for
__label__0 the proceedings was dubbed the Scottish
__label__0 Court in the Netherlands following the
__label__0 trial and a subsequent appeal the lane
__label__0 was ceded back to the Netherlands but
__label__0 for that short time Scotland was just a
__label__0 tiny bit bigger across the channel in
__label__0 the area that's always Scotland there
__label__0 are two islands called westerly and Papa
__label__0 westerly the airports of these two
__label__0 islands can boast that between them runs
__label__0 the shortest regularly scheduled
__label__0 commercial flight in the world it takes
__label__0 a mere minute cost 17 pounds and travels
__label__0 1.7 miles roughly the same distance as
__label__0 the runway of the airport of Edinburgh
__label__0 the capital of Scotland there are a
__label__0 number of places also called Edinburgh
__label__0 around the world but the coolest is a
__label__0 member of the seven seas located on the
__label__0 British overseas territory island of
__label__0 Tristan da Cunha number of the seven
__label__0 seas is considered to be the most remote
__label__0 inhabited place on earth the island is
__label__0 1,200 miles from the closest other
__label__0 inhabited place the island of Saint
__label__0 Helena and 1500 miles from the nearest
__label__0 continental and South Africa there's no
__label__0 airport and no regular transport links
__label__0 off the island the only way the 300
__label__0 residents can reach the rest of the
__label__0 world is by hitching a ride on a fishing
__label__0 boat and those only come 8 or 9 times a
__label__0 year at 64 square miles Tristan da Cunha
__label__0 is the 1060 a--the largest island in the
__label__0 world but the eighth largest island in
__label__0 the world is Victoria Island Canada on
__label__0 Victoria Island there's a lake which is
__label__0 home to an island which has a lake on it
__label__0 with one more Island this tiny 4 acre
__label__0 island is so remote that it's
__label__0 thought that no human has ever set foot
__label__0 on it Victoria Island the island that
__label__0 holds the lake that holds the island has
__label__0 the lake with this island is slightly
__label__0 bigger than Great Britain it has a
__label__0 population of less than 2,000 also in
__label__0 Canada but much farther south is
__label__0 Vancouver about 22 miles south of
__label__0 downtown Vancouver's point roberts
__label__0 washington which is part of the united
__label__0 states however you cannot get to the
__label__0 rest the United States without crossing
__label__0 into Canada this is because point
__label__0 Robert's lies south of the 49th parallel
__label__0 which constitutes much of the border
__label__0 between the two countries
__label__0 a few thousand miles to the east the
__label__0 border isn't quite as nice and straight
__label__0 in Detroit you can are intuitively have
__label__0 to travel south to get to Canada
__label__0 America's northern neighbor also
__label__0 counter-intuitively the westernmost
__label__0 point of Virginia is actually more
__label__0 westerly than the westernmost point of
__label__0 West Virginia and to finish off the
__label__0 counterintuitive lease the eastern end
__label__0 of the Panama Canal flows into the
__label__0 Pacific Ocean the ocean to the west
__label__0 while the western end of the Panama
__label__0 Canal flows into the Atlantic Ocean the
__label__0 ocean to the east and while we're so
__label__0 close to South America I might as well

__label__0  Two weeks ago I posted a video about why flying is so expensive and it turned out to be popular.
__label__0  However, they also wanted to know how it is possible that budget airlines are so cheap.
__label__0  That is a complicated but interesting answer. To keep it simple, and to ...
__label__0  not to exclude our European friends, we will focus on the European model of budget airlines.
__label__0  Although there are low-cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia and many other places ...
__label__0  budget airlines were the first successful in Europe and they are still today.
__label__0  The extent to which airlines such as Ryanair and
__label__0  EasyJet to reduce costs in Europe is also more significant than elsewhere in the world. Budget airlines in
__label__0  the US can be 10 to 20 percent cheaper than their traditional competitors, while in Europe
__label__0  the price of a budget airline only costs half or even a third of the price of one
__label__0  normal airline. You can regularly find flights of 2 to 3 hours with budget airlines for less than
__label__0  ten euro. So, how do they work? Not completely surprising
__label__0  Budget airlines take every expensive part of the flight and make it cheap.
__label__0  The most essential thing an airline needs is its planes and it is possible to save on this.
__label__0  In the months and years after 9/11 the growth of aviation stagnated
__label__0  most airlines had to fight to survive. Meanwhile, it went well with Ryanair and placed it
__label__0  a huge order of 151 737's from Boeing for an incredibly low price.
__label__0  Fortunately such a situation does not occur often, but budget airlines can always place large orders,
__label__0  what gives them a bulk discount. It may seem strange that a budget airline
__label__0  buy brand new planes, but the latest planes are the most efficient, saving fuel.
__label__0  The fuel efficiency of new aircraft outweighs the higher purchase price, so Easyjet (4.0),
__label__0  JetBlue (4.7), Ryanair (5.0) and Spirit Airlines (5.7) all have a younger fleet than any other major
__label__0  airline (KLM: 9.4, Air France: 11.5, Lufthansa: 12.4). Budget airlines usually have
__label__0  just one type of plane. Ryanair only has 737s and uses EasyJet alone
__label__0  the A320 family. One type of aircraft means pilots, flight attendants, mechanics
__label__0  and ground staff but need to be trained for one type of aircraft, which is a huge saving
__label__0  time and costs. Inside the aircraft, budget airlines often avoid unnecessary luxuries
__label__0  to keep costs low. For example, Ryanair seats can not be changed, because that is the
__label__0  purchase price would increase and more maintenance would take. The design of the chair
__label__0  saves the flight attendants time, because there are no bags on the seats that need to be cleaned between
__label__0  flights through. Stewardesses of budget airlines often stand by
__label__0  at the beginning of their career and get little training. They obviously get the
__label__0  necessary safety training, but little training in hospitality. In addition, they often fulfill
__label__0  multiple functions. When they have landed, some stewardesses will
__label__0  going to the gate to check tickets while others clean the plane. This saves
__label__0  the airline has three or four functions that it would otherwise have had to pay for. On board are flight attendants
__label__0  obviously responsible for eating and drinking, which is almost never free. Service on board
__label__0  can be a perfect way to earn extra money. Many budget airlines sell duty-free products
__label__0  and Ryanair even sells lots for a lottery.
__label__0  Let's talk about airports. You will never get Ryanair to London Heathrow or Paris
__label__0  Charles de Gaulle see flying because these airports are expensive. There is only a fixed number
__label__0  flights per day, making supply and demand ensure that
__label__0  the rate for the landing fee is high and the places are regulated. Instead Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted or Luton
__label__0  in London, or to Beauvais in Paris, which is also an 80-minute bus ride from Paris,
__label__0  technically not even in the same region as Paris and has a website that looks like this!
__label__0  In many cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of the few airlines that
__label__0  fly from that airport, which offers them a strong negotiating position. Often they will
__label__0  choose a small regional airport and rename it to another airport in a big city.
__label__0  They can ask for lower start and landing commissions and if the airport does not cooperate ...
__label__0  just threaten to leave the airport until the airport gives way. If there is no cheap,
__label__0  cost-effective airport in the vicinity of a city, budget airlines can also fly to regular airports
__label__0  during quieter hours, where landing fees and the chance of delays can be lower.
__label__0  Now let's look at the smallest details. The airlines of budget airlines
__label__0  are generally non-stop in use. This Ryanair plane, for example, went in one of Brussels
__label__0  to Copenhagen, from Copenhagen to Brussels, from Brussels to Prague, from Prague to Brussels, from Brussels
__label__0  to Nîmes, from Nîmes to Brussels, from Brussels to Treviso and finally from Treviso to Brussels.
__label__0  Budget airlines plan only between 30 and 45 minutes between the landing of a flight and the take-off
__label__0  the next flight, which often leads to delays and, moreover, has little time to clean the plane.
__label__0  However, this means that the aircraft always brings in money and passengers do not pay
__label__0  for the time the aircraft is stationary. Have you ever wondered why Southwest does not have reserved seats
__label__0  offers? Because the 'who-as-first-comes' system ensures that you almost always
__label__0  arrive at the gate well in time and set up in a neat line. This costs boarding
__label__0  less time and the plane is faster in the air. Another principle of budget airlines
__label__0  is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs, where most or all of them
__label__0  planes leave from. British Airways has London, Air France has Paris and KLM
__label__0  Amsterdam. To get to most places with these airlines, you need a connection to one of these
__label__0  "hubs". Budget airlines, however, try to have many destinations from many locations.
__label__0  However, this means that many destinations are only visited a few times a week.
__label__0  The cheapest budget airlines do not even allow connections between flights.
__label__0  This would increase costs because they would then have to pay ground staff to transfer baggage,
__label__0  make a more sophisticated ticket system and passengers to book when they are delayed
__label__0  miss their connection. Speaking of tickets, there is often no way for budget airlines
__label__0  get tickets from a real person. Ryanair charges 45 pounds
__label__0  if you forget to print your boarding pass and EasyJet and a number of other companies
__label__0  the check-in almost completely with machines. This also reduces staff costs.
__label__0  At airports, budget airlines do not want to use a trunk because they are expensive.
__label__0  Instead, they use stairs and let passengers walk across the platform or leave them one
__label__0  take a bus to get to the plane. Budget airlines earn a lot of money if they do well.
__label__0  EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%) and Wizz Air (10.2%) all have higher profit margins
__label__0  than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%) and Air France (2.15%). Much of the
__label__0  traditional airlines have employees who are members of a trade union with salary agreements
__label__0  that can not be changed, while budget airlines can hire everyone and train in a few months.
__label__0  It is also difficult for traditional airlines to grow. There must be a lot of demand for each new route
__label__0  because a large share of their turnover comes from business travelers.
__label__0  Because budget airlines are more focused on tourists, every destination that Ryanair adds for example
__label__0  a popular destination, simply because it has become possible to get there
__label__0  cheap to go. Some traditional airlines in Europe start their own budget airlines
__label__0  to also make a profit in this way. Air France has established Transavia and Lufthansa started Eurowings.
__label__0  Both lose a lot of money. What they seem to forget is
__label__0  that the US has gone through this phase a few decades ago. Delta started Song,
__label__0  that failed. US Airways started MetroJet, which failed. United started Shuttle, which failed
__label__0  after which they were declared bankrupt and decided to try again with Ted, which also failed.
__label__0  None of these has worked! Traditional airlines can not negotiate their employment contracts,
__label__0  honest business and dedication to their hubs. The reason that Ryanair
__label__0  and EasyJet succeeded while others failed, especially because they are
__label__0  be big and flexible. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands
__label__0  employees and a negotiating position that enables them to exceed their competitors.
__label__0  In the end, competition is good for us as customers. Even failing budget airlines
__label__0  reduce the costs of traditional airlines and enable us to fly the world more cheaply.
__label__0  Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video. Do not forget to click on Subscribe and
__label__0  follow me on Twitter via @WendoverPro. In case you want to discuss this video with me or others,
__label__0  I will link the first Reddit thread of my video here. I'm back with a next week
__label__0  new episode of That Wikipedia List.
__label__1 dbrand makes great precision cut vinyl
__label__1 skins for your mobile devices game
__label__1 consoles and game controllers you can
__label__1 check them out at the link in the video
__label__1 description so we are here in the
__label__0 gigabyte booth where they are focused
__label__0 mostly on their server stuff and this is
__label__0 my first encounter with an AMD epic
__label__0 server out in the wild like not actually
__label__0 at AMD's headquarters so this guy right
__label__0 here is got 6 nvme and 18 SATA drives it
__label__0 accepts up to 2 32 cores 64 thread epoch
__label__0 servers for a total of 128 threads not
__label__0 to mention that it can hold up to 4
__label__0 terabytes of memory if you've got oh I
__label__0 don't know about a hundred and fifteen
__label__0 thousand dollars to spend on your Ram
__label__0 Prayer system this one is designed more
__label__0 around versatility so you can throw a
__label__0 couple of Radeon Instinct mi-25 cards in
__label__0 the back throw some storage and throw
__label__0 some randon whatever the case may be but
__label__0 we're gonna see some really interesting
__label__0 designs moving forward with epic because
__label__0 as big data becomes more ubiquitous
__label__0 memory to store that information during
__label__0 processing becomes more and more
__label__0 important so high density high bandwidth
__label__0 memory solutions are an extreme demand
__label__0 right now and AMD is providing more no
__label__0 memory capacity and Mongo memory
__label__0 bandwidth and they're doing it
__label__0 relatively speaking on the cheap so
__label__0 Intel is currently charging about
__label__0 $10,000 for their flagship Xeon scalable
__label__0 while AMD is topping out at around
__label__0 $4,200 and changing gears entirely
__label__0 there's even more to be excited about so
__label__0 let's have a quick look at this guy
__label__0 right here in the same to you form
__label__0 factor this guy takes two Intel Xeon
__label__0 Platinum CPUs up to 24 dims and up to
__label__0 eight just perfectly normal GPUs each
__label__0 running at PCI
__label__0 16x thanks to these little riser boards
__label__0 with plx chips on them
__label__0 now hold on Linus you're talking about
__label__0 Intel all of a sudden epic comes back
__label__0 into the picture here because thanks to
__label__0 epics 128 PCI Express Lanes gigabyte has
__label__0 told us that they're actually planning a
__label__0 follow up to this particular model with
__label__0 a single epic CPU so not only could you
__label__0 be saving money on the CPUs you're
__label__0 buying you could actually be buying half
__label__0 as many of them with tons of memory
__label__0 bandwidth and tons of GPU support with
__label__0 no speed compromise so on a large scale
__label__0 these cost savings are going to be
__label__0 making huge waves in the deep learning
__label__1 space and on the subject of making huge
__label__1 waves dbrand has shaken up the vinyl
__label__1 skin industry I don't even know if you
__label__1 can call it a vinyl skin industry
__label__1 anymore because like who else even
__label__1 exists at this point over a deep brand
__label__1 you can get precision cut genuine 3 on
__label__1 vinyl skins for your phone your game
__label__1 console your mobile device and you can
__label__1 use their fantastic configurator to see
__label__1 exactly what it's going to look like
__label__1 when it arrives mixing and matching
__label__1 finishes and colors as you see fit their
__label__1 products are affordable they ship
__label__1 worldwide and you guys can check them
__label__1 out over at D brand comm slash CES 2018
__label__0 so thanks for watching guys
__label__0 dislike or like get subscribed so you
__label__0 don't miss any of our CES content and I
__label__0 mean yeah none of us are ever gonna buy
__label__0 one of these but isn't it cool
__label__1  This video was produced by Wendover Productions and sponsored by Great Courses Plus
__label__0  Here's an interesting question: Paris, France and New York, USA
__label__0  Which city do you think the population is more dense?
__label__0  The answer may seem obvious: New York, skyscraper kingdom, Big Apple ... right?
__label__0  error.
__label__0  In fact, New York's population density is less than half that of Paris.
__label__0  Paris lives 56,000 people per square mile (22,000 per square kilometer)
__label__0  New York City, with only 27,000 people per square mile (10500 square kilometers per square kilometer)
__label__0  To find a comparable European city with New York (the most densely populated city in the United States)
__label__0  You have to see the sixth in Europe: Lyon, France
__label__0  (27 000 per square meter / mile; 10500 per square kilometer.)
__label__0  Of course, New York has a super dense metropolitan core, but it is surrounded by an endless stretch of suburbs,
__label__0  Just like almost any other American city.
__label__0  On the other hand, virtually all of Paris's population is concentrated in the center of a compact city
__label__0  There is another interesting pattern between the two continents:
__label__0  In the United States, the affluent lives in cities, while affluent Europeans live in the city center.
__label__0  Compare the income maps for Paris and Philadelphia.
__label__0  Of course, this is a bit rough, but you can really see such a pattern,
__label__0  The most commonly cited reason for these two different trends is the difference in urban age.
__label__0  Most European cities have existed for hundreds or even thousands of years,
__label__0  While some American cities have reached the size of what can be called the city's population,
__label__0  However, the past one or two hundred years.
__label__0  This also means that in those times when the super-rich must commute by foot,
__label__0  European cities already exist.
__label__0  In the Middle Ages, Paris had between 20 and 300,000 people,
__label__0  But you can still walk from one end of the city to the other within 30 minutes,
__label__0  The population is incredibly dense.
__label__0  At that time, people must live within walking distance,
__label__0  Therefore, the rich pay more to live closer to the city center,
__label__0  A similar reason may explain why the historic European hotel
__label__0  The best, largest rooms you will often see are usually on the lower floors, as opposed to what you see today.
__label__0  Before the elevator was invented, the wealthy did not want to climb so many stairs on foot.
__label__0  Before the elevator was invented, the rich do not want to walk, climb so many stairs.
__label__0  Walking distance is not only important in big cities,
__label__0  Small villages in Europe are almost always the same size,
__label__0  This is because their population is determined by the extent to which their surroundings can be reached by foot
__label__0  European farmers tend to live in small towns and walk to their fields for work,
__label__0  This is different from the situation in which American peasants generally hold a manor.
__label__0  So here's the village
__label__0  It will only be as large as people can walk to the field only by foot.
__label__0  On the other hand, in the more modern era, the decentralized technology has become more advanced,
__label__0  American cities have also started their rapid growth period.
__label__0  As North American cities become larger and larger than people can walk,
__label__0  There is already enough technology to build a public transport system.
__label__0  There is already enough technology to build a public transport system.
__label__0  The first major public transport innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century.
__label__0  This is a very expensive mode of transportation, so only the super rich can use it.
__label__0  Interestingly, because the steam train takes a long time to accelerate,
__label__0  As a commune for the rich people to use the town, which is called the suburbs of the railway,
__label__0  It is not usually the nearest village, but a few miles from the city.
__label__0  The impact of the suburbs of the railway still exists today,
__label__0  In the old Philadelphia Railway, there is a rich community extension.
__label__0  From Ardmore to Malvern, there are huge manor and country clubs.
__label__0  There has been no change in the demographics since the suburbs of the railway.
__label__0  Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States.
__label__0  Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States.
__label__0  Like steam trains, trams also create new communities
__label__0  This time there is not much money for the upper middle class.
__label__0  In the affluent suburbs of Washington, DC, Tenley town, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville
__label__0  Are formed with the tram appeared.
__label__0  But again, walking distance affects geography,
__label__0  Tramcar commuters have to live within walking distance of tram stops,
__label__0  So people naturally focus on walking to the tram station takes 20 to thirty minutes away,
__label__0  Exceed this range ...... Nothing at all
__label__0  This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute.
__label__0  This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute.
__label__0  Then the car debut.
__label__0  At first, cars were used only by the upper classes, especially when the United States was also distracted by the two wars and the Great Depression
__label__0  However, the young Americans later returned from the battlefields of World War II,
__label__0  At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford.
__label__0  At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford.
__label__0  By 1950, more than 50% of families owned cars.
__label__0  In the meantime, the government provided loans to veterans,
__label__0  This has significantly increased the population that the United States can afford to buy.
__label__0  Instead of buying a small downtown real estate, this generation chose to use their new car commute
__label__0  In order to live in the suburbs, cheaper and better bigger house.
__label__0  The idea was that working parents would go to urban areas every day,
__label__0  The rest of the family will stay to enjoy the suburbs.
__label__0  This is the perfect deal.
__label__0  Although this whole history is absolutely true, it does not fully explain why
__label__0  European cities do not experience suburbanization.
__label__0  In Germany, many can even say most cities
__label__0  In World War II was bombed into ruins,
__label__0  They have the opportunity to rebuild their community in any way,
__label__0  But they chose to maintain a high density design.
__label__0  At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States.
__label__0  At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States.
__label__0  In the meantime, other European cities survived the war,
__label__0  Mass influx, but still maintain a huge population density.
__label__0  Crime may be the least cited reason for suburbanization in the United States.
__label__0  We sometimes forget, but this is a somewhat uglier period in American history
__label__0  The crime rate was crazy in the 70s, 80s and 90s.
__label__0  There are innumerable different theories to explain this, but perhaps the most interesting one is
__label__0  Higher leaded car exhaust contributes to lower IQ and higher aggression.
__label__0  In 1990, New York reached as many as 2,245 astronomical murders,
__label__0  London did not have as much in the entire 1990s.
__label__0  In the United States, the rate of violent crime continues to be ten times higher than in Britain.
__label__0  In 1992, a poll asked people moving out of New York why they were moving to the suburbs.
__label__0  The most common reason cited is "crime", reaching 47%.
__label__0  "Cost and quality of life" is as low as 10%.
__label__0  Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.
__label__0  Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.
__label__0  Europeans do not need to worry too much about such crimes in cities,
__label__0  So they are more willing to live in the city center.
__label__0  The land on the American suburbs is also more readily available,
__label__0  Because farmers are always quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.
__label__0  In contrast, France's agricultural subsidies per acre
__label__0  12 times higher than the United States.
__label__0  This is one of the big reasons why a large number of European cities are still surrounded by small farms.
__label__0  In many European cities, you can really take the city bus to the farm.
__label__0  In the end, all kinds of energy are cheaper in the United States.
__label__0  And in some European countries, a gallon of gasoline sold for $ 7,
__label__0  The United States on average only $ 2.20.
__label__0  It is significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe, so Europeans have a higher incentive to live closer to the office,
__label__0  Well, driving a short time, you can take the public transport.
__label__0  In addition, in Europe, electricity and heating costs are higher
__label__0  Large suburban homes are usually not attractive.
__label__0  However, suburban life did not meet everyone's expectations.
__label__0  Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains.
__label__0  Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains.
__label__0  This is 2.5% of their entire life.
__label__0  Science has also proven that commuting from the suburbs and higher blood pressure,
__label__0  Lower frustration tolerance, and higher odds of anxiety.
__label__0  In addition, the suburbs are no longer used to be country shelters,
__label__0  They are just an extension of a city.
__label__0  As a result, wealthy Americans began to return to cities,
__label__0  With lower crime rates, rising fuel costs and changing perceptions,
__label__0  The core of the city is ushering in revival.
__label__0  This is why we live in our present place.
__label__0  This is a complex, controversial, and surprising political history.

__label__0  The Cumberland Valley houses six villages that are between Hagerstown in Maryland and Harrisburg
__label__0  Pennsylvania - Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle and Mecanicsburg.
__label__0  What is so special about these small villages in Pennsylvania is that they are almost exactly
__label__0  16 kilometers apart.
__label__0  The distances do not deviate more than one mile from this line.
__label__0  This is no coincidence and this is also not planned.
__label__0  If you draw equally large circles around the villages, you can see their influence circles.
__label__0  Assuming that every city has exactly the same stores and services, rational people will go
__label__0  to the village nearest to buy or sell their goods.
__label__0  When villages are sixteen kilometers apart, this means that no one has to travel more than 8 kilometers to get one
__label__0  reach the village.
__label__0  All these villages were founded before the United States was formed, what
__label__0  means that nobody had cars and everybody had to walk everywhere.
__label__0  16 kilometers, or 5 kilometers there and back, is about the distance that one can travel well
__label__0  in one day with enough time to buy or sell goods on a central market.
__label__0  In this period before the car, a radius of 8 kilometers was in fact the greatest possible
__label__0  work traffic zone for small farming villages and therefore a distance of 16 kilometers was the most
__label__0  efficient way to use rural terrain.
__label__0  Take a look at the map of a rural environment that existed before the car.
__label__0  You will see that the distance between medium-sized villages is almost always somewhere between
__label__0  16 and 24 kilometers.
__label__0  Because the Cumberland valley is a valley, villages could only develop in a line,
__label__0  but in most cases villages develop in all directions.
__label__0  This is what the 16-kilometer rule looks like when it goes in all directions.
__label__0  Each of these points is a village and the hexagon around it is the area from which people
__label__0  will come to the village.
__label__0  In the real world, each of these villages will have a small supermarket, just like a pharmacy, a bank
__label__0  and maybe a restaurant.
__label__0  Since everyone uses these services, not many people have to live in the circle of influence
__label__0  of these villages to continue to exist.
__label__0  But where do you place something that is more specialized, such as a car mechanic.
__label__0  People only have to go to an auto mechanic once in a while, so you need more people for it
__label__0  survival of a garage than for a supermarket.
__label__0  Some of these villages develop into larger villages with more people who take care of it
__label__0  the survival of more specialized shops and services.
__label__0  Bringing these larger villages closer together with specialized stores would be untenable,
__label__0  since not enough people would go to these stores. But place them further apart
__label__0  would again be inefficient because there is land from which people would not go to a city.
__label__0  This happens once or twice, until you have cities.
__label__0  These cities have the largest influence circles and the most specialized stores.
__label__0  Of course there are still supermarkets and pharmacies in cities, but there are also things
__label__0  as dealers of expensive cars, special hospitals and airports.
__label__0  The influence circle of a city is enormous, because people will travel hundreds of kilometers
__label__0  to buy an expensive car, to get a special treatment or to fly from an airport.
__label__0  Think about it in a city.
__label__0  How far would you walk to buy a latte?
__label__0  Probably only a few blocks and that is why you see a Starbucks or other coffee shop
__label__0  on almost every street corner.
__label__0  Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people for one
__label__0  to maintain a coffee shop.
__label__0  But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook?
__label__0  Probably quite far, since it is an incidental and sustainable purchase.
__label__0  That is why Apple Stores are rare, even in cities.
__label__0  You need a large amount of people to maintain an Apple Store and we can even roughly
__label__0  calculate how much that is there.
__label__0  In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 30 kilometers away from the Store in New Haven
__label__0  to the northeast and from the Store in Stamford to the southwest.
__label__0  In the radius of 16 kilometers around the Trumbull Apple Store there are about half a million
__label__0  residents, which tells us that you need about half a million people to have one Apple Store
__label__0  to maintain.
__label__0  We can compare that with the Starbucks stores in Manhattan, which are spread over one
__label__0  average distance of about 180 meters.
__label__0  A circle of 90 meters around a Starbucks in Manhatten contains about 6,000 people,
__label__0  which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to continue to exist.
__label__0  Of course both Connecticut and New York are places with an above-average income
__label__0  means fewer people are needed to maintain one Starbucks or Apple Store.
__label__0  The figures would be different in for example rural Kansas, but because every store generally
__label__0  allleen builds in areas with above-average income, this gives us a pretty good picture of how much
__label__0  people need Apple and Starbucks to open a store.
__label__0  Our model thus shows where cities should be, but that is not the way it looks.
__label__0  This is the most efficient distribution of cities, if you assume that the cities are on one
__label__0  perfectly smooth landscape are built, without geographical aspects, no social influences, more variety
__label__0  in income, even distribution of resources - in other words, assuming that the world is a homogenous place ...
__label__0  and it is not.
__label__0  In reality, our world has a huge impact on where and why cities develop.
__label__0  To begin with, let's take this model back to one city in a bare environment without resources.
__label__0  What most influences the location of cities is water.
__label__0  If we place an ocean next to our isotropic stretch of land, our city will almost certainly develop
__label__0  close to this ocean.
__label__0  Oceans still connect the world.
__label__0  There is no other way of transport to transport such large quantities of goods
__label__0  for so little money.
__label__0  Every city must be economically efficient to grow and it costs more for goods
__label__0  to a city that is 1,500 kilometers inland than to a city near the ocean.
__label__0  Just look at Europe.
__label__0  Six of the ten largest European cities are within 150 kilometers of the coast.
__label__0  But oceans are not the only forms of water that affect cities.
__label__0  Rivers have just as much - or perhaps even more - influence.
__label__0  Milan, the 18 th largest city in Europe, is the largest one that is not immediately on
__label__0  an ocean or river lies and then it is only 25 kilometers away from a river and 120 kilometers from
__label__0  the ocean.
__label__0  Until the last century, cities could not survive without direct access to water.
__label__0  If you need more evidence: 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen
__label__0  kilometers from the ocean.
__label__0  Perhaps the most logical attraction for cities is resources, so back to us isotropically
__label__0  land: we place raw materials somewhere on this map and sign cities in the neighborhood.
__label__0  Cities that existed for the past century arose close to resources,
__label__0  like Pittsburgh, since this city acted as producer and transporter for
__label__0  these means, but nowadays cities that depend on resources are no longer so close to
__label__0  the means itself to be established.
__label__0  New techniques of transport can supply the resources from their source.
__label__0  Just look at Dubai.
__label__0  Of course, the UAE have a huge supply of oil, but they are much closer to Abu Dhabi and
__label__0  the southwest than Dubai.
__label__0  In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 inhabitants, less than half of Carlisle in Pennsylvania - one
__label__0  from the farming villages we talked about at the beginning of this video.
__label__0  That only grew to 40,000 in 1960, but nowadays it is known worldwide and has more than it
__label__0  2.5 million inhabitants.
__label__0  It was able to grow rapidly - even faster than Abu Dhabi - because it threw itself
__label__0  as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industry in the region.
__label__0  Another geographic aspect that we can add to the piece of land are mountains.
__label__0  Mountains do not always have the same effect on cities.
__label__0  Mexico City, Bogota and Addis Ababa are all three huge cities that are higher than
__label__0  2,000 meters.
__label__0  Mountains make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection.
__label__0  Many cities from antiquity developed in these places because they were easy to protect ...
__label__0  and that provided more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also stand in the way of that development.
__label__0  For a time the United States could not develop anything west of the Appalachian mountains.
__label__0  These mountains were a huge obstacle.
__label__0  In 1800, the center of the population was here, despite
__label__0  that the US had sovereignty over this entire area.
__label__0  Ultimately, technology defeated this obstacle and could extend the population
__label__0  to what is now Missouri, but if the Appalachians had not existed,
__label__0  American history and geography had looked very different.
__label__0  We had seen urban developments much earlier in the mid-west.
__label__0  But mountains can also have a different effect.
__label__0  Coal, silver, gold and other minerals are often located in mountainous regions
__label__0  areas and, just like in Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable areas
__label__0  because of the resources.
__label__0  The economic benefit of exploiting the funds is stronger than the economic disadvantage
__label__0  an inhospitable area.
__label__0  Denver, Colorado grew by 650% between 1870 and 1880 thanks to the opening of a rail network
__label__0  connected to the transcontinental rail network.
__label__0  It served as an access point for transportation to gold mines in the Rocky Mountains.
__label__0  Mountains can therefore keep cities away, but also attract themselves - it really depends
__label__0  of the circumstances.
__label__0  Let's exchange our isotropic piece of land for a world map.
__label__0  What should the cities be on here?
__label__0  The cities of our world are not necessarily all located in the most geographically efficient location.
__label__0  Although there is a certain level of natural selection that allows the efficiently placed cities to grow
__label__0  and the inefficiently placed cities shrink, people are not always able to
__label__0  to build cities in the most efficient place.
__label__0  Let's get the 224 cities in the world that have a population of more than 2 million.
__label__0  You can immediately see some patterns.
__label__0  We put the equator on the map and you see a clear difference.
__label__0  Only 32 of these cities are in the southern hemisphere.
__label__0  One might think that this is because there is much more land in the northern hemisphere,
__label__0  but that is not entirely true.
__label__0  The southern hemisphere still has 32% of all the country in the world, but only 14%
__label__0  of the largest cities in the world.
__label__0  There is clearly a greater density of cities in the northern hemisphere.
__label__0  You can easily trace this back to Europe and Asia.
__label__0  The first great civilizations and dominions were on these two continents, although it
__label__0  human race probably originated in Africa.
__label__0  There are hundreds of different theories about why civilizations are successful in some places
__label__0  and do not succeed in other locations, but one of the more plausible and interesting explanations is that
__label__0  Europe and Asia were successful because they are broad, rather than high.
__label__0  The shape of the continents may have changed human history.
__label__0  When a continent is wide, you have a lot of land with roughly the same climate.
__label__0  A climate generally changes when you go north or south, not when you go east or west,
__label__0  because of the way the earth revolves around the sun.
__label__0  Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with growing plants,
__label__0  the breeding of animals and the associated technology.
__label__0  When you expand in width, the climate is sufficiently equal so that a rule is the same
__label__0  successful plants and animals can use, while expanding in height requires that new ones
__label__0  plants and animals are bred and bred.
__label__0  If a civilization started in central America, for example, there would be very little land
__label__0  on the continent with a similar climate and the expansion possibilities would be limited.
__label__0  In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there are thousands and thousands of kilometers with the same
__label__0  climate that can be achieved simply by traveling east or west.
__label__0  There is evidence to support this.
__label__0  Just look at the maps of the four greatest early empires - the Qing dynasty, the Abbasid-
__label__0  Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate and the Mongolian Empire.
__label__0  These were all in Eurasia and the horizontal spread.
__label__0  When some of the more modern empires expanded, there was already technology to do this sea.
__label__0  The three great modern empires were the British, Spanish and French empires - all of them
__label__0  coming from a similar climate.
__label__0  An important reason why America was able to be successful was because all agriculture came from Europe
__label__0  worked there too.
__label__0  In terms of climate technology, Europe and America are almost identical.
__label__0  The majority of developed colonized countries are in the Northern Hemisphere because
__label__0  these were closest to Europe, but former British countries like South Africa, Australia
__label__0  and New Zealand are all very developed and are located in the southern hemisphere.
__label__0  Their success at the expense of the more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also become partial
__label__0  attributed to their climate, which more closely matches that in Europe.
__label__0  Let's ask one more question.
__label__0  If our world had only one city, where would it be?
__label__0  If you take the average of the location of every person in the world, you will end up
__label__0  in the south of central Asia.
__label__0  That means that this entire region is the best place to live, but true
__label__0  exactly must our metropolis come?
__label__0  This region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia, so we already meet
__label__0  those two criteria.
__label__0  We want a spot within about 150 kilometers of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains
__label__0  rich in minerals - the only real best place for a city on earth is probably ...
__label__0  Dhaka, Bangladesh.
__label__0  Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to build a city
__label__0  than here.
__label__0  There is evidence to support this: Dhaka is between the third largest metropolis
__label__0  on earth, depending on how you define it and Bangladesh is except for 5
__label__0  the most densely populated country in the world - 161 million people live in an area that is about the size of
__label__0  England.
__label__0  History has sufficiently influenced geography making it the largest and most advanced civilizations
__label__0  not all in the south of central Asia, but if we would start all over again, humanity
__label__0  would do again, then each geographic model says that this region the origin and the central
__label__0  point of human civilization.

__label__0 today we're going to talk about space
__label__0 walk so back in the old days property
__label__0 owners had the rights to their land
__label__0 going up forever and ever
__label__0 in perpetuity but then the airplane came
__label__0 around and smart people realized it you
__label__0 couldn't just go around asking every
__label__0 property owner for permission to fly
__label__0 through their airspace so government
__label__0 societ they would own the air above a
__label__0 certain level in general government
__label__0 decided that property owners owned their
__label__0 land up to 500 feet above ground level
__label__0 and then the air above that going up
__label__0 infinitely was to be owned and
__label__0 controlled by the government
__label__0 this made life easier for airplanes but
__label__0 then America invented space and that
__label__0 made things a little more complicated in
__label__0 most cases satellites and spacecraft
__label__0 orbit around the earth so it would be a
__label__0 logistical nightmare to request
__label__0 permission to enter into the airspace of
__label__0 each nation in an orbit once again smart
__label__0 people got together and decided that
__label__0 those air rights that countries had
__label__0 given themselves should end at a certain
__label__0 level different countries say different
__label__0 things but all of them agree that
__label__0 somewhere between 19 miles above earth
__label__0 the altitude of the highest airplanes
__label__0 and balloons and 99 miles above earth
__label__0 the altitude of the lowest orbiting
__label__0 satellites a country's claim to
__label__0 sovereignty stops so this begs the
__label__0 question which laws apply in space so
__label__0 let's say an astronaut commits a small
__label__0 crime all in space like I don't know
__label__0 doing a line want a spacecraft this
__label__0 isn't a huge crime against humanity but
__label__0 they're gonna have to be punished if the
__label__0 astronaut had those happy times on the
__label__0 spacecraft of a specific country it
__label__0 would be clear which country would
__label__0 prosecute if it wasn't a Soyuz capsule
__label__0 Russia would prosecute if it was in a
__label__0 SpaceX capsule the US would prosecute
__label__0 much like with boats the spacecraft is
__label__0 considered to be an extension of the
__label__0 sovereignty of that country but let's
__label__0 say mr. astronaut did his line while on
__label__0 the moon who would prosecute then the
__label__0 Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that no
__label__0 country can claim a section of space or
__label__0 a celestial body as their territory so
__label__0 this means that no country's laws apply
__label__0 universally on the moon well this is
__label__0 where the idea of extraterritorial
__label__0 jurisdiction comes into play in almost
__label__0 every kind
__label__0 citizens are subject to the laws of
__label__0 their own country even if they are
__label__0 outside of the country this doesn't
__label__0 apply when they are in other countries
__label__0 and see other countries laws Trump the
__label__0 extraterritorial jurisdiction but when
__label__0 they aren't in any country these laws do
__label__0 apply this means that two people in the
__label__0 exact same place can be subject to
__label__0 different laws an 18 year old british
__label__0 astronaut could technically drink on the
__label__0 moon one 18 year old american astronaut
__label__0 could not just to make things a little
__label__0 bit more complicated the rules are
__label__0 different on the International Space
__label__0 Station this Space Station agreement the
__label__0 document that outlines the rules of the
__label__0 ISS says that in most cases
__label__0 extraterritorial jurisdiction applies
__label__0 each astronaut is subject to the laws of
__label__0 their own country however if for example
__label__0 an American astronaut say punches a
__label__0 french one out of frustration France
__label__0 will be allowed to prosecute American
__label__0 astronaut the same rule applies with
__label__0 property if a British astronaut smashes
__label__0 a Canadian astronauts computer Canada
__label__0 could prosecute the Brit in addition
__label__0 this agreement allows for the
__label__0 extradition of astronauts in all cases
__label__0 regardless if the two countries have a
__label__0 normal extradition treaty this is
__label__0 actually pretty important because Russia
__label__0 doesn't have an extradition treaty with
__label__0 the US this means that Russia doesn't
__label__0 have to give up individuals who have
__label__0 committed a crime in which the US has
__label__0 the right to prosecute in the case that
__label__0 a Russian commits a crime against an
__label__0 American on the ISS however Russia would
__label__0 be obliged to extradite that astronaut
__label__0 another situation and look at is what
__label__0 would happen if a baby was born in space
__label__0 first off this is a super hypothetical
__label__0 because it's unknown if it's even
__label__0 possible for a baby to be born in
__label__0 zero-gravity and if they were their
__label__0 bones would be so brittle that they
__label__0 would crush under their own weight if
__label__0 they return to gravity it's unlikely
__label__0 that any country would allow for an
__label__0 astronaut to have a baby in space
__label__0 because that would be like super
__label__0 unethical but for the sake of argument
__label__0 let's say there was a space baby
__label__0 what nationality would that baby be
__label__0 there is actually precedent for this
__label__0 question thirteen babies have been born
__label__0 in Antarctica where there's a similar
__label__0 treaty that disallows sovereignty
__label__0 while those babies were not born in
__label__0 their parents countries they took their
__label__0 parents nationalities the same policy
__label__0 applies in space there are countries
__label__0 however that don't give citizenship to
__label__0 babies born outside of the country so in
__label__0 that case the baby would take the
__label__0 citizenship of the country of the
__label__0 spacecraft they were born in this is the
__label__0 same rule that applies when a baby is
__label__0 born on an airplane in flight they take
__label__0 the nationality of their parents and if
__label__0 that's not possible
__label__0 they take the nationality of the country
__label__0 in which the aircraft is registered and
__label__0 what happens that the baby is born on
__label__0 the Moon or Mars where there is no
__label__0 sovereignty well I don't know man what
__label__0 do I look like a lawyer but seriously
__label__0 nobody really knows this is just one of
__label__0 many flaws in current space law only 536
__label__0 people have been to space and all of
__label__0 them were highly trained and were
__label__0 representing their country they just
__label__0 aren't the type of people to commit
__label__0 crimes as commercial spaceflight and
__label__0 space tourism develop all these laws
__label__0 will need to be made more clear to
__label__0 prevent future problems gone is the era
__label__0 when these laws can just be figured out
__label__0 when and if the time comes in the near
__label__0 future we could be seeing space mining
__label__0 as well and that will require economic
__label__0 laws and environmental treaties the
__label__0 coming decades will be a fascinating
__label__0 time as we watch not only the
__label__0 development of commercial space
__label__0 industries but also as we lay out the
__label__0 legal and political groundwork needed
__label__0 for the opening of the final frontier
__label__0 following the bombing of Pan Am flight
__label__0 103 over Scotland a deal with reach
__label__0 between Gaddafi of Libya and the British
__label__0 government in which the trial of the
__label__0 accused bombers would happen in a
__label__0 neutral country in return the
__label__0 extradition
__label__1 synergy 2 is available now and makes
__label__1 sharing a keyboard a mouse between two
__label__1 systems so simple that anyone could do
__label__1 it check it out in the link of the
__label__1 description down below
__label__0 we're here at fantex checking out a
__label__0 setup that has two power supplies shared
__label__0 into one system that's so simple anyone
__label__0 can do it or one power supply shared
__label__0 into two systems so simple that anyone
__label__0 could do it
__label__0 fantex has teamed up with c sonic to
__label__0 make these power supplies and they're
__label__0 two different ones for the two different
__label__0 applications let's start with the revolt
__label__0 Pro this is the one you'll be using if
__label__0 you want to use multiple power supplies
__label__0 on the same system that isn't just two
__label__0 you could theoretically go beyond just
__label__0 the two we have here but I suspect the
__label__0 vast majority of people will stick with
__label__0 just two power supplies now how does
__label__0 this work you may have seen the power
__label__0 supply combiner and splitter that fantex
__label__0 is released in the past they've
__label__0 essentially built that functionality
__label__0 into these power supplies individually
__label__0 so the revolt Pro has your motherboard
__label__0 connector a whole bunch of CPU and PCIe
__label__0 connectors a whole bunch of SATA and
__label__0 molex connectors and then down below
__label__0 these rubber stoppers there's another
__label__0 motherboard and another CPU pin input
__label__0 connector that you would plug another
__label__0 power supply into it doesn't technically
__label__0 have to be a fan Tech's power supply
__label__0 although I do suspect that they would
__label__0 probably prefer that but you could use
__label__0 whatever power supply you want and it's
__label__0 able to share some of its power up to I
__label__0 believe 600 watts through this main
__label__0 power supply but it's also able you're
__label__0 able to use the other cables from the
__label__0 other power supply if you want to plug
__label__0 in more molexes or more graphics cards
__label__0 or whatever else you need
__label__0 and there's failover protection so if
__label__0 you are able to power both systems off
__label__0 of one power supply that is connected
__label__0 into each other say you go with the
__label__0 1,000 watt version and you have a beefy
__label__0 system or the 850 watt version and you
__label__0 have a fairly mid-tier average system
__label__0 that people are building these days one
__label__0 entire power supply could go down and
__label__0 your system won't shut down another cool
__label__0 thing about this that I like is if
__label__0 you're building a system that you need
__label__0 to power supplies for say Austin and
__label__0 scrapyard Wars season 3 or if you're
__label__0 mining or if you're just doing something
__label__0 crazy with computers and you need
__label__0 multiple power supplies you don't have
__label__0 to mess around with bridging the 24 pin
__label__0 connector with the green wire and the
__label__0 black wire and making sure that you
__label__0 switch both the power supplies on at the
__label__0 exact right time so that you don't have
__label__0 part of your system powered up and the
__label__0 other part
__label__0 not powered up now everything's plugged
__label__0 into each other it's really simple you
__label__0 have one power switch everything's just
__label__0 fine it'll work but moving on from there
__label__0 we have the revolt X which is kind of
__label__0 the opposite it splits instead of
__label__0 joining on this one you have labels for
__label__0 system one where you have motherboard
__label__0 CPU connections SATA molex PCIe all that
__label__0 kind of stuff and then there's system
__label__0 two where you have motherboard and CPU
__label__0 as well this is also great but for
__label__0 completely different scenarios this
__label__0 enables you to run say two systems in
__label__0 one box you could have your main system
__label__0 that you do everything on air and your
__label__0 day-to-day then you could have your
__label__0 streaming box or a workstation or a test
__label__0 system or whatever else on the other
__label__0 side this also makes it so that say you
__label__0 have two workstations next to each other
__label__0 you could run them out of the same box
__label__0 with two systems out of the same box
__label__0 split monitors onto each side and then
__label__0 you're at higher efficiency this is a
__label__0 1200 watt Platinum rated power supply
__label__0 and if you look at efficiency curves
__label__0 down on the lower end if you're not
__label__0 using that much power say both the
__label__0 systems are idling on two separate power
__label__0 supplies you're at low efficiency on
__label__0 both of the power supplies this will
__label__0 make it that you're gonna climb the
__label__0 efficiency curve a little bit make us of
__label__0 those idling times which is actually a
__label__0 pretty high percentage of the time
__label__0 you're using your core you're not using
__label__0 your computer I guess when you're asleep
__label__0 and whatnot if you don't turn your
__label__0 computer off or even when you just walk
__label__0 away from it if it's idling it will be
__label__0 more efficient than other possible
__label__0 solutions you get one power supply that
__label__0 isn't at a higher price than it would be
__label__0 if it didn't have this internal
__label__0 functionality it's a quite competitive
__label__0 price for other power supplies at the
__label__0 1200 watt range same with the revolt pro
__label__0 that we mentioned earlier it's not
__label__0 necessarily higher price than anything
__label__0 else in its competitive range and it
__label__0 looks really good
__label__0 I like this grill on the top and you're
__label__0 able to gain this functionality you
__label__0 could use these things you could use the
__label__0 revolt X 1200 watt as a single power
__label__0 supply for a single system you could use
__label__0 the revolt Pro 850 or 1000 watt as a
__label__0 single power supply for a single system
__label__0 you're paying essentially the same
__label__0 amount and you're gaining functionality
__label__0 to possibly use in the future say you
__label__0 want to grow on your system you want to
__label__0 add a graphics card or two or do some
__label__0 other crazy stuff and you have the
__label__0 revolt Pro well you could just get
__label__0 another power supply link it in you have
__label__0 more wattage you have more connectors
__label__0 everything's kind of handled for you
__label__0 it's nice and smooth so you go with the
__label__0 revolt X and you
__label__0 - just add another whole computer you
__label__0 had a workstation beside you you had an
__label__0 employee your girlfriend wants a
__label__0 computer something like that you already
__label__0 have the power supply you just plug it
__label__0 into the other system and you're done
__label__0 you even have to buy another one that's
__label__0 pretty cool a trusted power supply brand
__label__0 like see sonic coming together with
__label__0 fantex to add really cool functionality
__label__0 to their power supplies and make
__label__0 everything nice and simple and easy to
__label__0 use is really cool if you decide to go
__label__0 with something like the revolt X and
__label__1 have two systems you might need some
__label__1 software to link the keyboard and mouse
__label__1 as well over the system soon I'm doing
__label__1 sponsor spot there we go synergy 2 is
__label__1 out they've simplified a whole bunch of
__label__1 stuff with the new release there's no
__label__1 longer the server client settings that
__label__1 you have to set up just all your systems
__label__1 will work together it's also able to
__label__1 communicate over more complicated
__label__1 networks that's energy to you sooner if
__label__1 you one used to have problems with back
__label__1 in the past so you have to worry about
__label__1 that stuff anymore
__label__1 there's a new UI there's SSL encrypted
__label__1 connections it's it's much more simple
__label__1 even able to access your computers
__label__1 before you've logged into them if you
__label__1 have all this stuff shared over which is
__label__1 nice so you can move the stuff over
__label__1 login from there everything's nice and
__label__1 good to go if you want to check it out
__label__1 check it out in the link in the
__label__0 description I like the video if you
__label__0 liked it dislike if you disliked it stay
__label__0 subscribed for all the rest of our CES
__label__0 2018 content I did not suspect we would
__label__0 be doing this many power supply videos
__label__0 but everything's been really cool so far
__label__0 so yeah stay tuned I'll see you next
__label__0 time
__label__1 so this video from CES 2018 is brought
__label__1 to you by group Renault check out our
__label__1 video there symbiote Zelo car at the
__label__1 link in the video description Haji bow
__label__0 are you ready I'm ready for anything
__label__0 well I'm ready for anything that I've
__label__0 been programmed to be ready for it so as
__label__0 you can probably imagine team G bow was
__label__0 well let's just say they recognized our
__label__0 crew when we were walking by on the show
__label__0 floor here at CES and they actually had
__label__0 some pretty specific responses to some
__label__0 of the criticisms we had of their geebo
__label__0 home robot first of all Haji bow who's
__label__0 the President of the United States
__label__0 Donald Trump is the president of the
__label__0 United States so there you go Jibo knows
__label__0 what's up now and they've made a lot of
__label__0 improvements since then rolling out OTA
__label__0 updates about every two weeks now
__label__0 there's actually been one small hardware
__label__0 tweak as well the screen has been
__label__0 swapped out for a higher resolution one
__label__0 with rounded corners unfortunately it's
__label__0 not OLED this supply is just not there
__label__0 yet but hey it's a small improvement and
__label__0 we'll take it now let's talk about the
__label__0 software updates because there have been
__label__0 a ton tweaks to camera processing for
__label__0 better pictures what they're calling
__label__0 fresh and lively features to make Gebo a
__label__0 little more topical like a snow globe
__label__0 during the holidays geebo can now play
__label__0 music through iHeartRadio so at this
__label__0 time there's not a ton you can do in
__label__0 terms of voice controls and he still
__label__0 doesn't support services like Spotify
__label__0 but they are expecting to add more
__label__0 services and the ability to do things
__label__0 like TiVo play the next song in the near
__label__0 future the team has added a new
__label__0 commander mode that actually allows you
__label__0 to see through G Bo's eyes which lights
__label__0 up a purple LED revealing that G bow has
__label__0 full RGB lighting in his LED strip and
__label__0 in fact there is probably other hardware
__label__0 lying dormant under the hood and the
__label__0 GEVO team has in fact confirmed that for
__label__0 us another feature of commander mode is
__label__0 the ability to type a message and have G
__label__0 Bo say it - Texas is the best so you can
__label__0 be looking around you can go hey this
__label__0 room's pretty messy
__label__0 hey there's my son yo kid clean your
__label__0 room and giba will say it well in a in a
__label__0 nicer way geebo now uses information
__label__0 from Google in addition to the previous
__label__0 sources and can also do live sports
__label__0 tours even adding a little bit of color
__label__0 commentary to the mix like the Celtics
__label__0 are crushing the Knicks integration with
__label__0 Philips hue nest and Allrecipes is
__label__0 coming as is a find my phone function
__label__0 something that I'm sure that we can all
__label__0 relate to a big priority for the
__label__0 development team is personalized report
__label__0 so debo will see you and say something
__label__0 like hey Linus you got to get going oh
__label__0 by the way it's raining so you might
__label__0 want to grab an umbrella on your way out
__label__0 the door or if I were to give debo an
__label__0 instruction like when you see my wife
__label__0 can you ask her to pick up some
__label__0 groceries next time she's at the grocery
__label__0 store debo can pass along that
__label__0 instruction using his facial recognition
__label__0 now to be clear I still have a lot of
__label__0 doubts about Jibo and for that matter
__label__0 smart assistants in general for as long
__label__0 as they are stationary but it's clear
__label__0 that the geebo team is a taking feedback
__label__0 seriously and be continuing their
__label__0 software development work so I do look
__label__0 forward to seeing how it continues to
__label__0 change in the future and we will be able
__label__0 to do that because the winning bid for
__label__0 our sign G bow was an epic troll so we
__label__0 still have it thanks for checking out
__label__1 this video from CES 2018 this video was
__label__1 brought to you by group Rando you guys
__label__1 got to check out their symbioses demo
__label__1 car we've got a video linked in the
__label__1 description but they did a full demo
__label__1 allowing me to take it out on real
__label__1 French roads with real drivers around at
__label__1 a level for autonomous operating level
__label__1 so that means that I was sitting in that
__label__1 thing going okay I'm leaned way back
__label__1 there's a big screen here I cannot even
__label__1 see over the dashboard and this car is
__label__1 straight up driving itself telegraphing
__label__1 its moves around other vehicles as we
__label__1 change lanes and even being able to
__label__1 operate autonomously with the driver
__label__1 wearing a VR headset I was a driver I
__label__1 was wearing a VR headset and they had
__label__1 the sensors of the car actually dialed
__label__1 into the VR headset
__label__1 and the programming for it so that you
__label__1 could be driving in this like
__label__1 fantastical environment like I had like
__label__1 a flock of birds go by and I kind of
__label__1 went like this and it was an actual car
__label__1 totally crazy go check it out to see
__label__1 what group renault is doing in the space
__label__1 of autonomous car innovation so thanks
__label__0 for watching guys if you dislike this
__label__0 video you can hit that button but if you
__label__0 liked it hit like get subscribed and
__label__0 maybe consider checking out where to buy
__label__0 the stuff we featured because this is
__label__0 one of the few things we've covered at
__label__0 the show that you can actually buy today
__label__0 but whether or not you should is still
__label__0 up to you Haji Bo how'd I do
__label__0 sorry ouch
__label__1 this video is brought to you by mass
__label__1 drop check out the focal LX headphones
__label__1 at the link in the video description so
__label__0 a soos is pretty into these portable
__label__0 monitors and they are stepping up their
__label__0 game this is the Zen screen go we've got
__label__0 two signs to make sure that nobody
__label__0 screws up what it's called you know I
__label__0 mean who could screw up what a display
__label__0 is called if it's on a sign next to it
__label__0 nobody obviously and the big difference
__label__0 between this one and other mobile
__label__0 displays is not really in the spec so
__label__0 it's full HD
__label__0 so if 1920 by 1080 IPS brightness I mean
__label__0 it's not I shattered or anything but it
__label__0 looks pretty darn good certainly
__label__0 suitable for the coffee shop but the big
__label__0 difference here is that it's got a
__label__0 battery built in now so you can get
__label__0 about 4 hours of charge using your
__label__0 notebook with an external display when
__label__0 you don't have access to a plug so if
__label__0 you're the kind of person who is often
__label__0 traveling and you're you know sitting at
__label__0 your gate at the airport trying to get a
__label__0 little bit of extra work done and you
__label__0 don't have an outlet this could be a
__label__0 lifesaver especially because it's not a
__label__0 lot thicker than other external portable
__label__0 displays that we've seen in the past but
__label__0 what if you're looking for something
__label__0 kind of like that except you have like a
__label__0 lot of money to spend and you want like
__label__0 the best one well then you might be
__label__0 after the Asus Pro rpq 22 you see this
__label__0 guy right here is a twenty one point six
__label__0 inch 4k display
__label__0 so that's 204 pixels per inch with 99%
__label__0 coverage of dcpip 3 it's got a USB C
__label__0 input actually it's got 2 USB C inputs
__label__0 as well as micro HDMI and ok none of
__label__0 that sounds that impressive but wait
__label__0 there's more this is actually an OLED
__label__0 display so this is the first that I've
__label__0 ever even heard of using an OLED panel
__label__0 from the company Jay o LED and like the
__label__0 ones that we just looked at before it is
__label__0 completely detachable it is only about 8
__label__0 centimeters thick
__label__0 meter centimeters thick and this is a
__label__0 great opportunity to check out those
__label__0 viewing angles is that impressive or
__label__0 what and they're estimating that pricing
__label__0 is going to be under $1,000 which
__label__0 doesn't sound that amazing for like a
__label__0 portable monitor
__label__0 but is super impressive for an OLED
__label__0 display at this time so The Stand
__label__0 folds up I actually haven't seen how it
__label__0 folds up yet so the fact that I could
__label__0 figure it out on the fly
__label__0 it's pretty impressive at least to me
__label__0 and then you just go ahead you unplug it
__label__0 hopefully I'm allowed to do that and you
__label__0 throw it in the carrying case which I
__label__0 also haven't seen how it works exactly
__label__0 but theoretically it's a little
__label__0 something like that in bippity boppity
__label__0 boop you are ready to leave the suite
__label__0 never to be seen again oh wait after I
__label__1 tell you about our sponsor today mass
__label__1 drop so the featured product here is the
__label__1 focal LX headphones they've got 44
__label__1 millimeter drivers using aluminium
__label__1 magnesium and shaped cones for great
__label__1 impulse response and transient response
__label__1 as well as low distortion so you can
__label__1 learn more about these headphones and
__label__1 get full details including pricing at
__label__1 the link to the drop below thanks for
__label__0 checking out this video from CES 2018 if
__label__0 you guys disliked you can hit that
__label__0 button but if you liked it hit like get
__label__0 subscribed and maybe consider checking
__label__0 out where to buy the stuff we featured
__label__0 at the link below which you can't buy
__label__0 yet so maybe just subscribe for all of
__label__0 our CES videos here at CES because
__label__0 that's usually where you make CES videos
__label__0 hello I'm Sam this is my channel this is
__label__0 that Wikipedia list and this is that
__label__0 Wikipedia list
__label__0 you can't copy money I don't mean it's
__label__0 illegal
__label__0 that's obvious I mean that you
__label__0 physically cannot copy money on a
__label__0 photocopier this is probably the only
__label__0 thing in the world that your copier will
__label__0 simply refuse to copy with pretty much
__label__0 any modern copier an error message will
__label__0 come up if you put a bank note or
__label__0 something resembling a bank note in the
__label__0 scanner I tell you to try it but there
__label__0 are so many laws surrounding currency
__label__0 that I'm pretty sure I'd have the police
__label__0 kicking down my door tomorrow if I did
__label__0 you can just take my word for it it's
__label__0 pretty interesting how money is detected
__label__0 by photo copiers for almost any major
__label__0 currency there's one symbol that tells
__label__0 machines that what they're seeing is
__label__0 money it's called the Orion
__label__0 constellation and it looks like this it
__label__0 was first discovered on the 10 euro note
__label__0 in this cluster of circles but has since
__label__0 been found on the American dollar the
__label__0 Swedish Krona the UK pound and pretty
__label__0 much every other major currency most
__label__0 photo copiers will if they see this
__label__0 pattern of dots stop printing in an
__label__0 attempt to stop counterfeit at least
__label__0 that's how it used to be more recently
__label__0 copiers have moved to a system called
__label__0 the counterfeit deterrent system which
__label__0 is incredibly secretive and effective
__label__0 nobody is really sure how it works
__label__0 and while the Euro Ryan constellation
__label__0 might be part of it these security
__label__0 measures make it even more difficult to
__label__0 copy banknotes Adobe Photoshop like most
__label__0 photo editing software's has the
__label__0 counterfeit deterrent system built-in
__label__0 which lets you see just how well it
__label__0 works Photoshop can of course detect
__label__0 this image of a ten-pound note since
__label__0 it's you Ryan constellations are clearly
__label__0 visible but then it can also detect it
__label__0 if the area is blacked out it can even
__label__0 figure out that this tiny almost
__label__0 completely blacked out image is part of
__label__0 a u.s. $20 bill and refuse to edit it
__label__0 there's a ton of different laws relating
__label__0 to the duplication and publication of
__label__0 visuals of currency the US has 32 pages
__label__0 of laws related to currency along with
__label__0 the obvious
__label__0 of counterfeit it's also illegal in the
__label__0 u.s. to print or publish any
__label__0 illustration of currency postage stamps
__label__0 or revenue stamps of any nation in the
__label__0 world unless of course it's a stamp made
__label__0 under the migratory bird hunting Stamp
__label__0 Act of 1934 and no that's not a joke
__label__0 it's also illegal to deface currency in
__label__0 any way or to use the image of currency
__label__0 in any advertisement it is however legal
__label__0 to show authentic banknotes in videos
__label__0 and films for this reason in most cases
__label__0 the money used in movies is real -
__label__0 legally create prop money the bill has
__label__0 to be less than 75 percent or more than
__label__0 150 percent of the size of authentic
__label__0 currency one-sided and must be destroyed
__label__0 immediately after use unless they want
__label__0 to do something that's illegal with
__label__0 money like Burnet or otherwise to face
__label__0 it filmmakers will often use real money
__label__0 just for simplicity sake some prop
__label__0 manufacturers will create a stack of
__label__0 blank green paper then top it with one
__label__0 real bill to give the appearance of
__label__0 stacks of currency in conclusion don't
__label__0 mess around with counterfeit it will
__label__0 almost never end well thank you for
__label__0 watching sorry for the short episode but
__label__0 I wanted to get something out this week

__label__1 and enter Linus tech tips in the how did
__label__1 you hear about us section
__label__0 we're here at keikar keikar is the
__label__0 world's first multimedia robot for your
__label__0 home you can control him with native
__label__0 voice commands that are processed
__label__0 locally or extend his capabilities with
__label__0 Google home or Alexa does any of that
__label__0 make sense it didn't to me at first so I
__label__0 had to seek Iker with my own eyes
__label__0 to understand keikar let's break it down
__label__0 into parts for audio you've got 4 10
__label__0 watt speakers and a 50 watt subwoofer
__label__0 that's more than most TVs come with by
__label__0 default so your audio listening
__label__0 experience for music or movies should
__label__0 actually be pretty good now for video
__label__0 there's a projector on sort of the front
__label__0 at 720p and it can rotate up to 90
__label__0 degrees vertical so you can watch movies
__label__0 directly on the wall in front of it or
__label__0 you can tilt it all the way up
__label__0 vertically onto the ceiling or anywhere
__label__0 in between then on the top it has a
__label__0 360-degree camera which you can use to
__label__0 interface with your kids or freak the
__label__0 ever living crap out of your pets or use
__label__0 as a security device or whatever else
__label__0 you could think of with a mobile
__label__0 360-degree camera and yes I did mean
__label__0 mobile keikar can move it has wheels on
__label__0 the bottom and while yeah it's gonna
__label__0 kind of suck at stairs it would be able
__label__0 to move around one floor of your house
__label__0 quite effectively and it will map out
__label__0 that floor of your house moving to its
__label__0 charging dock when it needs to and
__label__0 coming to you when you need it to so you
__label__0 just made a sandwich and you go into the
__label__0 living room and you want to watch a show
__label__0 for some reason kickers in the bedroom
__label__0 you're like hey keikar go to the living
__label__0 room play Netflix stranger things it'll
__label__0 come to the real living room it'll play
__label__0 Netflix for you on the wall because why
__label__0 not so if you're not currently watching
__label__0 Netflix which I know it sounds crazy but
__label__0 it is a possibility and you're not
__label__0 trying to harass your pet with this
__label__0 crazy robot that rolls around the ground
__label__0 and can you make light come from it you
__label__0 can do other things as well it has
__label__0 humidity and temperature detection and
__label__0 it also has movement detection and light
__label__0 detection so you can use it as a
__label__0 security device when you're away from
__label__0 the home but if you don't need your
__label__0 mobile temperature detecting humidity
__label__0 detecting intruder detecting light
__label__0 detecting robot to do anything other
__label__0 than just play different types of video
__label__0 in different rooms in your house well it
__label__0 has Android TV built-in as well so you
__label__0 can install whatever apps on it you want
__label__0 with keikar extending from Google home
__label__0 and Alexa much in the same way that
__label__0 something like Philips hue would you can
__label__0 send commands to it through those
__label__0 devices so like with Philips hue if you
__label__0 were like hey turn the lights down you
__label__0 could also do something like hey keikar
__label__1 what's the sponsor spot and keep you
__label__1 would be like oh yeah hey it's
__label__1 FreshBooks although i I don't I don't
__label__1 think that functionality is in that
__label__1 right now it might be in there later but
__label__1 with freshbooks you can do tons of stuff
__label__1 you can create invoices in 30 seconds or
__label__1 less which is awesome you can view if
__label__1 someone who's actually seen your invoice
__label__1 or not so they're not paying the invoice
__label__1 you can ask them why and make sure that
__label__1 they've actually seen the invoice maybe
__label__1 if they didn't see it you can resend it
__label__1 or something like that
__label__1 and you can even set up online payments
__label__1 so if they aren't able to pay you in
__label__1 person or if this is an online job or if
__label__1 it's really just easier for them to do
__label__1 it online because maybe they're paying
__label__1 later when you're not there you'd be
__label__1 able to handle all of that through fresh
__label__1 books so you can focus on being
__label__1 productive and actually growing your
__label__1 business instead of wasting time on a
__label__1 whole bunch of unnecessary paperwork if
__label__1 you want to try it out try out your free

__label__0 we'll make some cool videos I'm watching
__label__0 I'll see you later
__label__0  Higher education is expensive. But then also very expensive. Mainly here, in the United States of
__label__0  weapons, fast food and study debt. It has not always been that way. In 1980 the average tuition fee
__label__0  per year at a four-year private school about $ 3,500. After correction in connection with inflation
__label__0  is that about $ 10,200. Today, a year in higher education costs $ 32,000 -
__label__0  three times as much as just 36 years ago. How this comes? That is a complicated one
__label__0  and controversial question. To understand why higher education has become more expensive,
__label__0  we must first understand why higher education has always been expensive. The biggest part
__label__0  your school fees go to salaries. The average national student / faculty ratio is 18: 1,
__label__0  which means that there is one member of the faculty for 18 students. The average professor
__label__0  in a private school earns $ 126,981 a year. Divided by 18, that's just $ 7,054,
__label__0  what does not seem that bad. However, you must realize that there is more than just the
__label__0  faculty. There are coaches, gardeners, kitchen and facility staff, technicians,
__label__0  admission committees, marketers, IT staff, security guards and
__label__0  directors. Added up are these salaries and extras from all these people
__label__0  an amazing $ 24,000 of the total $ 32,000 in school fees. Salaries are high because,
__label__0  like in many other branches, follow the rules of supply and demand. The most popular
__label__0  studies change from time to time because interests change because of changes in culture. The
__label__0  problem is that you can not magically make new professors. By the time new professors
__label__0  have finished their 20 year study and have specialized in a field, that study is not
__label__0  longer popular. So when a study is popular, colleges should compete for it
__label__0  to get professors and the only thing that matters is money. Money provides more professors,
__label__0  more professors provide more students and more students provide more money. At the same time
__label__0  get professors of studies that were popular in the past, job guarantee. That means that
__label__0  promote academic freedom, professors have the guarantee to keep their jobs
__label__0  until they retire. Because professors can not be dismissed, there is often a surplus
__label__0  to professors in studies that are less popular. So, we still have $ 8,000 in tuition
__label__0  about. Colleges need places to teach and the school infrastructure is unusually expensive.
__label__0  Lessons usually take place only for 8 to 10 hours a day, 5 days a week and about 40
__label__0  weeks per year. That means that classrooms are only used 23% of the time. The university must
__label__0  however, just pay for that space during that other 77% of the time, which costs a lot.
__label__0  Moreover, colleges like to build beautiful buildings because they attract students. The average
__label__0  cost to build a building varies by location, but is $ 115 to $ 215 per average
__label__0  square meter. However, U-Mass Amherst's Commonwealth Honors College cost $ 354 per year
__label__0  square meters, the U-Mass Boston's General Academic Building 1 cost $ 594 per square meter
__label__0  and the Berkely's Lower Sproul Building cost $ 659 per square meter.
__label__0  There are, of course, other factors that contribute to the high price of higher education, but staff
__label__0  and buildings are the big two. Then now why higher education has become three times as expensive. It is
__label__0  always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently used buildings,
__label__0  So what has changed in the last 30 years? Well, higher education is more popular than ever. In
__label__0  in the past 20 years the number of registrations has increased by 50%. Support from the government
__label__0  for colleges has also risen to record high since 1980, but with the simultaneous
__label__0  increase in the number of students, the converted support per student is at a low point. Ohio paid in 1990
__label__0  flagship of universities - Ohio State University - 25% of their public money budget,
__label__0  while in 2012 only 7% of their budget was paid by the government. With less government money
__label__0  students have to pay more out of their own pocket to make up for the difference. Added to this
__label__0  colleges have adapted to be attractive to the new generation. According to William Strauss and
__label__0  Neil Howe is the generation of millennials - people born between 1982 and 2004 - characterized
__label__0  7 properties: they are protected, confident, cooperative, conventional, pressured,
__label__0  results and they feel special. Millennials are also sometimes called 'trophy children'
__label__0  and are generally more ambitious and feel more unique than the previous generation, which means
__label__0  that they believe more in 'the right match' when choosing a study. Colleges responded
__label__0  to this new attitude by adding more and more facilities to stand out more for
__label__0  the growing number of students. All these new facilities had to be managed, which contributes
__label__0  to the explosion in administration at universities. According to the US Department of Education
__label__0  the number of administrative jobs increased by 60% between 1993 and 2009. That is 10 times
__label__0  faster than the number of permanent jobs for professors.
__label__0  Just as I finished my video 'Why Fly So Expensive' with the announcement that
__label__0  flying is not very expensive, I finish this video with the announcement that higher education also
__label__0  not that expensive. 85 process of full-time students on four-year programs
__label__0  receive a financial compensation of about $ 15,500 on average.
__label__0  That is a considerable amount, but I admit that there is still a large amount left. Until
__label__0  you consider that higher education is the only major investment you can make
__label__0  your life, especially today. People who follow higher education earn on average 98% more per hour
__label__0  than people who only have a high school diploma and that was only 40% 35
__label__0  year ago. Taking that into account, what is the real price of higher education? When you look at it holistically,
__label__0  Over your entire life, the costs of higher education are not $ 32,000 per year or $ 128,000
__label__0  for four years, but minus $ 500,000. By crossing the possibility to go to a college,
__label__0  you lose on average half a million dollars in potential income. Follow higher education,
__label__0  children. Thanks for looking! I'm very happy
__label__1  to tell - for the first time ever - that this video has been sponsored by audible.com. Audible is one
__label__1  company that I really admire and used for years before they sponsored me. Just like probably
__label__1  all subscribers of Wendover Productions, I love learning and a good way to learn
__label__1  is by reading books. The problem is that I have a busy life and hardly have time to
__label__1  to sit down to read a book. Instead I only read in my planning by listening to books
__label__1  while driving, washing, running, and so on. Audible has a fantastic selection of 250,000
__label__1  titles, including one of the best non-fiction books of all time and a personal favorite
__label__1  from me, Freakonomics. This can be free for you, forever, by signing up for a trial version
__label__1  of 30 days by using the link www.audible.com/wendover. And you can do anything else
__label__1  download book for free with that trial version. Using that link to sign up is the

__label__1 thank you the group Renault for
__label__1 sponsoring this video at CES 2018 check
__label__1 out their symbiotes concept car in the
__label__1 description down below
__label__0 we're here at table pong they have these
__label__0 Atari pong tables for $2,800 they've got
__label__0 these chairs for 250 bucks it can
__label__0 display the time or the scoreboard on
__label__0 the table it has RGB lighting but who
__label__0 cares let's let's just play that's kind
__label__0 of all doing okay two-player mode then
__label__0 you have to tap an orange button so that
__label__0 you lock in your number here okay so I
__label__0 serve that's what I mean have you tried
__label__0 this already I have okay give me okay
__label__0 okay so three three three two one play
__label__0 against the AI press press one player
__label__0 does this work
__label__0 hold on what's in it so let's go man
__label__0 that's how it used to be let's see if
__label__0 you can beat me I'm gonna pretend I'm
__label__0 playing your control level is pretty
__label__0 you got to spin a lot it's realistic
__label__0 though who's gonna be some real if
__label__0 you're on the wrong side and you need to
__label__0 get over you have to go really fast
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 oh I'm good computer play yeah yeah how
__label__0 you like that how you like that no wow
__label__0 that's right that's right baby no no so
__label__0 you kids today you want to play your
__label__0 your digital game maybe you have an
__label__0 advantage like analog games
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 [Applause]
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 what you know I'm taking it twice
__label__0 oh okay okay now let's not even against
__label__0 the thing tell you what why don't you
__label__0 play the game
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 that's pretty close that was pretty
__label__0 close good job good job all right
__label__1 thanks for grouper known for sponsoring
__label__1 this video check of the symbiotes car in
__label__1 the concept in the description down
__label__1 below
__label__1 lioness rode in it in France with a
__label__1 laptop in the front seat yeah it's like
__label__1 seriously cool I was wearing a VR
__label__1 headset at one point in the sensors of
__label__1 the car we tied into the headset so that
__label__1 I would see like virtual representations
__label__1 of cars and objects around me as like
__label__1 flocks of birds going past while he's
__label__1 driving down the road because it's level
__label__1 4 autonomous so it completely drives
__label__1 itself yeah it was one of the weirdest
__label__1 experiences of my life just like taking
__label__1 my hands off the wheel so guys if you
__label__1 want to see group rhinos vision of the
__label__1 future of autonomous driving you can
__label__1 check out that video on the link below
__label__1 rematch
__label__1 sure this is freaky this is very feisty
__label__1 $2,800 I think and then 250 bucks if you
__label__1 want the two chairs yes which you should
__label__1 probably give the two chairs because
__label__1 it's a little low and these are the
__label__1 perfect height for it anyways thanks for
__label__0 watching like it if you liked it dislike
__label__0 if you disliked it get subscribed to see
__label__0 no more CES content because this is it
__label__0 I'll see you later
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 but
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 [Music]
__label__0 whoa
__label__0 moon colonization is something that
__label__0 humans have dreamt about for centuries
__label__0 and it's entirely possible it's just a
__label__0 matter of cost bringing both humans and
__label__0 supplies the two hundred and thirty-four
__label__0 thousand miles the lunar surface costs
__label__0 an enormous amount of money and it's
__label__0 difficult to justify the cost of
__label__0 taxpayers so how much would it cost well
__label__0 that's a complicated question for the
__label__0 sake of simplicity let's say we're doing
__label__0 a one-year return mission with four
__label__0 astronauts using NASA technology
__label__0 the first thing we'll calculate is the
__label__0 cost of getting there and we'll need a
__label__0 rocket the Saturn 5 is the only rocket
__label__0 to have ever existed that is powerful
__label__0 enough to take humans beyond low Earth
__label__0 orbit the problem is all 15 of them are
__label__0 long retired the Saturn 5 had a lunar
__label__0 payload capacity of 90,000 pounds and a
__label__0 per launch cost of a hundred and eighty
__label__0 nine million 1971 dollars or 1 billion
__label__0 123 million 2016 dollars which works out
__label__0 to $12,500 per pound transported to the
__label__0 moon that may seem like a lot but that
__label__0 would mean that the average American
__label__0 winged 159 pounds could travel to the
__label__0 moon on technology that existed when
__label__0 computers looked like this for a mere
__label__0 two million dollars I know you know that
__label__0 that's not right there are two problems
__label__0 in that calculation first off that
__label__0 doesn't include research and development
__label__0 costs a staggering 6.4 billion dollars
__label__0 was spent to develop the Saturn 5 which
__label__0 is 38 billion in 2016 dollars so
__label__0 considering that the Saturn 5 was
__label__0 launched 13 times that works out to just
__label__0 over 4 billion dollars per launch or 44
__label__0 thousand dollars per pound but to
__label__0 colonize the moon you don't just need to
__label__0 get things to the moon you need to get
__label__0 them on the moon the budget allocated to
__label__0 develop and build 12 lunar landers back
__label__0 in the Apollo days was 18 billion 2016
__label__0 dollars or 1.5 billion dollars per
__label__0 Lander once again the lunar landers are
__label__0 no longer in service so we're including
__label__0 the R&amp;D costs in our calculations we
__label__0 need two Landers to bring our four
__label__0 astronauts to the moon and these have to
__label__0 be able to return so they need to land
__label__0 with both the launch systems and fuel so
__label__0 that's 1.5 billion per Lander plus 4
__label__0 billion per saturn v launch so 11
__label__0 billion total to carry our astronauts to
__label__0 the moon and back during the Apollo days
__label__0 NASA also developed a module called the
__label__0 LM truck which was designed to deliver
__label__0 payloads to the surface of the Moon
__label__0 without a crew not only could these land
__label__0 with 11,000 pounds of car
__label__0 but a Saturn 5 rocket could launch with
__label__0 two of them using the truck we can bring
__label__0 our per pound cost of bringing cargo to
__label__0 the lunar surface down to a reasonable
__label__0 three hundred and eighteen thousand
__label__0 dollars believe it or not that's a
__label__0 bargain so once our four astronauts get
__label__0 to the moon they need somewhere to live
__label__0 the Center for Strategic and
__label__0 International Studies in Washington DC
__label__0 did a super detailed study on how much
__label__0 the development and construction of a
__label__0 lunar base would cost for our
__label__0 four-person base it would cost twenty
__label__0 billion dollars to develop plus one of
__label__0 our four billion-dollar launches
__label__0 equaling twenty four billion that's a
__label__0 little steep for a budget option we
__label__0 could go with something like big low air
__label__0 spaces be three thirty spacecraft these
__label__0 are essentially inflatable buildings
__label__0 that work in space and with a bit of
__label__0 modification they could conceivably be
__label__0 altered to work on the surface of the
__label__0 Moon Bigelow airspace is a commercial
__label__0 company they've said that the be three
__label__0 thirty would rent out for 1.25 million
__label__0 dollars per day or four hundred sixty
__label__0 five million dollars for our one-year
__label__0 mission concerning that's the first time
__label__0 I've said million when talking about a
__label__0 current day cost that's practically
__label__0 nothing until you consider the problem
__label__0 of getting the be three thirty to the
__label__0 moon
__label__0 it weighs forty three thousand pounds so
__label__0 it takes four LM truck landings and to
__label__0 Saturn five launches for a total of
__label__0 fourteen billion dollars well that's a
__label__0 little better than 24 billion let's move
__label__0 on to food for food the best but not
__label__0 simplest solution is to just grow it one
__label__0 lunar greenhouse developed by the
__label__0 University of Arizona could produce
__label__0 about 5.5 pounds of food per day in
__label__0 order to have variety NASA would
__label__0 probably choose a few different crops
__label__0 that would do well on the moon for our
__label__0 calculations will say that the
__label__0 greenhouse would be filled with 76%
__label__0 sweet potato 16 percent tomato and 10
__label__0 percent strawberry that'll come out to
__label__0 4.3 pounds of sweet potato point eight
__label__0 pounds of tomato and point four pounds
__label__0 of strawberries per day sweet potatoes
__label__0 have 389 calories per pound or 1675
__label__0 calories per day per greenhouse the
__label__0 tomatoes and strawberries will make
__label__0 sixty five and sixty calories per day
__label__0 per greenhouse respectively so that's
__label__0 1800 calories per day per greenhouse
__label__0 total each of our four astronauts would
__label__0 need about three thousand calories per
__label__0 day equaling 12,000 total per day so
__label__0 we'll need six point six seven
__label__0 greenhouses total and since you can't
__label__0 really bring two-thirds of greenhouse
__label__0 we'll bring seven and have surplus food
__label__0 which is great for backup each lunar
__label__0 greenhouse will require a point two
__label__0 pounds of fertilizer
__label__0 per day which adds up to 1.4 pounds of
__label__0 fertilizer per day for our seven
__label__0 greenhouses and 510 pounds for the year
__label__0 so for the greenhouses growing scheme
__label__0 we'll need to physically bring the
__label__0 greenhouses which each weigh a full
__label__0 metric ton or 2200 pounds which for the
__label__0 seven of them is fifteen thousand four
__label__0 hundred pounds or four point nine
__label__0 billion dollars plus another one hundred
__label__0 and sixty two million dollars for
__label__0 fertilizer the international space
__label__0 station is a really good example of how
__label__0 water resources could be managed on the
__label__0 moon every bit used on the ISS is
__label__0 recycled that includes water from
__label__0 condensation showers sweat and yes urine
__label__0 it of course gets filtered heavily but
__label__0 the water and astronauts food is the
__label__0 same that came from you know other stuff
__label__0 nASA says that without water recycling
__label__0 forty thousand pounds of water would be
__label__0 needed to sustain for astronauts on the
__label__0 moon that would cost twelve point seven
__label__0 billion dollars to transport with water
__label__0 recycling we can bring that down to five
__label__0 thousand one hundred and ten pounds of
__label__0 water for the year except we have our
__label__0 greenhouse quite a bit of water is
__label__0 needed to grow the plants six thousand
__label__0 nine hundred and twenty pounds worth to
__label__0 be specific that's twelve thousand
__label__0 thirty pounds of water for the year
__label__0 which would cost three point eight to
__label__0 five billion dollars to bring so next we
__label__0 need air as an oxygen to breathe a human
__label__0 at moderate activity levels needs one
__label__0 point eight five pounds of oxygen per
__label__0 day so that means we need seven point
__label__0 four pounds of oxygen per day for our
__label__0 four astronauts 2701 pounds of the year
__label__0 which would cost eight hundred and sixty
__label__0 million dollars but wait because of our
__label__0 greenhouses and the amazing process of
__label__0 photosynthesis we don't one lunar
__label__0 greenhouse produces 0.75 pounds of
__label__0 oxygen per day so our seven create five
__label__0 point two five pounds of oxygen each day
__label__0 so we only need to bring two point one
__label__0 five pounds of oxygen per day or 785
__label__0 pounds for the year which will cost a
__label__0 mere two hundred and fifty million
__label__0 dollars you may ask why we don't use an
__label__0 oxygen scrubber and the simple answer is
__label__0 that it would cost quite a bit more to
__label__0 develop build and deliver a scrubber
__label__0 capable of creating enough clean air for
__label__0 a crew of four it's just cheaper and
__label__0 less risky to bring all the necessary
__label__0 oxygen there in terms of power it's been
__label__0 proposed that the best way to bring
__label__0 electricity to the moon is to literally
__label__0 bring a nuclear reactor it'd be a little
__label__0 one but it would carry out fission
__label__0 reactions on the surface of the moon
__label__0 nASA has only proposed not developed
__label__0 this system but they said it could be
__label__0 developed fly
__label__0 tested and delivered to the moon for
__label__0 only 1.4 billion dollars now we have
__label__0 everything we need so to answer the
__label__0 question you came here for how much
__label__0 would it cost to live a year on the moon
__label__0 I'll just say before giving my answer
__label__0 that these were all estimates and far
__label__0 from perfect for example it's likely
__label__0 that if NASA ever actually colonized the
__label__0 moon it would be decades in the future
__label__0 when commercial space companies are far
__label__0 more developed and the cost of transport
__label__0 would be much less spaceflight
__label__0 Industries already sells cargo space to
__label__0 lunar orbit for a mere 10 million
__label__0 dollars per 220 pounds with prices that
__label__0 low it may not be long until living on
__label__0 the moon and other celestial bodies
__label__0 becomes commercially advantageous
__label__0 through mining and tourism the very day
__label__0 this video goes up Elon Musk is
__label__0 anticipated to announce SpaceX is plans
__label__0 to get to Mars including a massive
__label__0 rocket they'll be able to carry as many
__label__0 as two hundred and twenty thousand
__label__0 pounds to Mars for less than any
__label__0 previous rocket which could make Martian
__label__0 colonization economically feasible so
__label__0 after adding everything up my
__label__0 conservative estimate for one year with
__label__0 four astronauts on the moon comes out to
__label__0 36 billion dollars that's 98 million per
__label__0 day 4.1 million per hour sixty eight
__label__0 thousand three hundred dollars per
__label__0 minute or 1130 eight dollars per second
__label__0 more than an average family makes in a
__label__0 year in Madagascar is it worth it
__label__0 maybe if we ever have to leave Earth
__label__0 because of the environmental change that
__label__0 we've started that 36 billion dollars
__label__0 might be the best investment we've ever
__label__0 made after all living on the Moon or
__label__0 Mars or some other celestial body is a
__label__0 crucial first step in learning how to
__label__0 survive when the earth is no longer
