__label__0  So I learned it was a great opportunity in front of me
__label__0  I was able to sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how to run the country in my view
__label__0  Or I would accept that he sees things differently than I think
__label__0  And to try a deep, intelligent and respectful interview.
__label__0  My goal was not only a smart and respectable interview
__label__0  With someone I may not share my opinion on some topics
__label__0  But I was hoping to prove that it would be fun.
__label__0  For that, I went to Washington where I met the president.
__label__0  Yesterday the meeting, we went to the studio
__label__0  In Maryland, we trained on it with Frederic
__label__0  He's a Google employee, a very funny man.
__label__0  The next day, we went to the White House and we met a dog president
__label__0  Which was in fact very soft.
__label__0  We have settings and make sure we move correctly what we need
__label__0  Each of us went to a corner to review the questions for the last time
__label__0  To make sure we adjust what we say.
__label__0  Then the President waited for us to come and we started the interview
__label__0  The president had told us who we were
__label__0  Susie would give him a light about the interview,
__label__0  And then I was watching him with a video
__label__0  Then Ingrid would ask him what was in his pocket.
__label__0  Many people wanted to know, once I read these, cards
__label__0  In the White House, these cards are available, before the interview.
__label__0  The answer is: no.
__label__0  What I did is
__label__0  I looked him in the eye all the time
__label__0  This was evident, through his physical expression
__label__0  That makes him comfortable
__label__0  That impressed me. When I was aware of it
__label__0  I said to myself: Yahah, a citizen who came back to the White House
__label__0  In an interview with the world's most powerful man,
__label__0  In an interview on live broadcast
__label__0  This is very transparent.
__label__0  I do not care what you say about the man's policy,
__label__0  But that impressed me, and I liked it a lot.
__label__0  For several reasons, I was not nervous, really
__label__0  I was so excited about it.
__label__0  I decided to ask questions first
__label__0  On how to develop his intelligence in areas that may not be his specialty.
__label__0  The answer was important, because it is clear
__label__0  Has changed its means throughout the presidency.
__label__0  While he was answering, it was clear to me that he was in a traditional position to meet
__label__0  His body was untouchable
__label__0  Remember that until now the president is not aware of the quality of the interrogators I am.
__label__0  For information, I could have been tough.
__label__0  What happened next is something I will never forget
__label__0  I learned that we were on the same wave,
__label__0  I really wanted to make it clear to him,
__label__0  He listened to him for 10 hours through recorded books.
__label__0  Note the face of the President,
__label__0  You will see the moment when we were contacted.
__label__0  Opama: I think it's compatible with,
__label__0  You are aware of this, the approach of scientists to address problems in general.
__label__0  Destin: Actually I've listened to your recorded books
__label__0  And in "my father's dreams,"
__label__0  He concluded by addressing the National Democratic Convention of 2004.
__label__0  Did you see that? Let's go back and take a look at the language of his body.
__label__0  He was discreet, and then the call happened.
__label__0  Is not that great?
__label__0  It was the moment when she was really interviewed
__label__0  It became fun and smart
__label__0  Between two people who want each one for the better one.
__label__0  It was a wonderful moment, and I will never forget it.
__label__0  My second question was about polarization.
__label__0  It was clear to me that the country knows two poles very much about what it was before,
__label__0  In fact, there are data to make sure.
__label__0  Whatever your point of view, it has become very common to make fun of
__label__0  From the other side and to blame him for all the country's problems.
__label__0  The president explained why this is growing.
__label__0  Obama: The problem is that, when we return to our policy,
__label__0  Whatever the reason,
__label__0  This is largely related, as you know, to the media
__label__0  Some people only watch Fox News
__label__0  Others do not, only read the New York Times,
__label__0  And so they are not starting from the common points between them.
__label__0  They take two positions in their view of the world only.
__label__0  Dastin: In the field of theoretical enmity, there are so-called "magnifying results"
__label__0  There is what is positive and what is negative views.
__label__0  If you remove the negative from any two systems, the discrimination will occur and create chaos.
__label__0  This is not the science of politics, this of mathematics.
__label__0  When people listen, from right or left, to the media that pleases them only
__label__0  This is dangerous.
__label__0  There are no negative responses that bring you back to the moderate middle, and this will lead to extremism.
__label__0  I liked what the President said on this point,
__label__0  Because it is the responsibility of each of the parties in the political dialogue
__label__0  To listen to the arguments of the other.
__label__0  Otherwise, you will be in the echo room, and you will only hear those sounds
__label__0  That inflated, what, you want to hear, and then a little will only remain a controversy.
__label__0  My third question was about space, where the president shook hands,
__label__0  I forgot to be a respected and respected gentleman.
__label__0  On the whole, you can see in my face how excited you are to this question
__label__0  I would like the viewer to listen to the President's answer.
__label__0  I wanted to end this with a funny observation, so I asked him this interesting question from Reddit:
__label__0  Destin: If there is something to be called after you, opium
__label__0  I hope that this is the first time that you have been asked this question.
__label__0  OBAMA: I never got that question.
__label__0  Destin: Excellent
__label__0  the question is:
__label__0  Obama: This is the first time.
__label__0  Destin: So what do you want this tool to be
__label__0  Obama: What is the tool ..... What will be ....
__label__0  Destin: The tool is an opium.
__label__0  OBAMA: The question is, what will be the affairs of Obama?
__label__0  Destin: That's true
__label__0  Obama: That's important
__label__0  Dosten: I will not show all his answers now, and I encourage you to see the whole interview
__label__0  You will find it full in the White House Channel. White's House Channel.
__label__0  It is time to talk about what you have learned from this experience.
__label__0  The exercise of thinking about questions to ask the most powerful man in the world
__label__0  It's different from being at home or chatting with your friends
__label__0  And planning to go and sit, and look into his eyes
__label__0  And ask questions.
__label__0  I united myself I would like to know more,
__label__0  More mutual and more compassionate.
__label__0  Why? Why do we tend to be disrespectful?
__label__0  These two things are what I have learned from the president's interview on how to communicate with people
__label__0  May differ from them.
__label__0  No. 1. If you write or chat with someone in your phone,
__label__0  I will say that I sit with that person, and look at them in the right,
__label__0  Because I want to be respectful and tolerant.
__label__0  # 2: If you can listen, that's great!
__label__0  Think about it, if I listen, not just ride my answer to show that I'm smart,
__label__0  But if he really listened to contact with them from heart to heart,
__label__0  My credibility and the extent of my influence on that person will increase!
__label__0  Even if he was the most powerful man in the world, think about it.
__label__0  Respect and listen.
__label__0  It's really simple.
__label__0  But that is very hard.
__label__0  And thank you, it went from the rockets,
__label__0  To the President's interview .... This is really crazy!
__label__0  In any case, if this is the first episode you see on the channel every day smarter
__label__0  For some reason, you feel comfortable joining the channel, do so,
__label__0  But only if you think it's worth it!
__label__0  Another scoundrel, I thank the fans who supported me from the start
__label__1  To date, this is awesome and is Audible.com
__label__1  So I prepared for this interview,
__label__1  I shot some shots from the White House to tell you what I learned.
__label__1  I hope you enjoyed my experience at the White House.
__label__1  If you are interested in listening to President Barack Obama's books,
__label__1  The first is "Dad Dreams", you can get free sermons on Audible.com/smarter
__label__1  And I really advise you this book, it is an excellent reader,
__label__1  Fabulous. Another book, "The Audacity to Hope"
__label__1  You have full freedom to check out these books, and I suspect it is, important to you
__label__1  Be aware of the ideas of the country.
__label__1  On the whole, I would like you to pass on Audible.com/smarter
__label__1  "The audacity on the amps" and "My father's dreams."
__label__1  He was with you Dustin. To win every day is smarter! I wish you a pleasant day!
__label__0  So there is a fantastic list on Wikipedia called 'Wikipedia: Unusual Items'.
__label__0  I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
__label__0  It is a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected and incredible subjects.
__label__0  Whichever link you click, it is guaranteed to be interesting.
__label__0  And that is why I am going to click on a new link
__label__0  and you learn a bit more about our amazing world.
__label__0  Today we are going to make a trip.
__label__0  We are going to escape the stiff boundaries of the earth.
__label__0  Up to the heavens.
__label__0  We travel through the galaxy.
__label__0  To learn about keeping time, on the red planet.
__label__0  Mars.
__label__0  But before we can keep track of the time on Mars,
__label__0  we must first understand how we keep time on the earth.
__label__0  Damn. Ehm. Can we ... can we turn this thing around?
__label__0  OK. So this is the Greenwich Observatory, in England.
__label__0  Greenwich is known as the place where the prime meridian lies.
__label__0  For clarity, this is the middle of the earth in length.
__label__0  For the sake of clarity we say that time is determined on the basis of the sun.
__label__0  However, this is not entirely true, so I have another video in which time is explained in more detail.
__label__0  When the sun is at its highest in the air at a random location, we call it 12:00 in the afternoon.
__label__0  And the time during the rest of the day is relative to this.
__label__0  So let's go south now, to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.
__label__0  We are in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.
__label__0  Just as the prime meridian is the middle of the earth in length,
__label__0  the equator is the center of the earth in width.
__label__0  At this point of 0 ° length and 0 ° width,
__label__0  It is 12:00, because the sun is at its highest point in the air.
__label__0  Beautiful. When we go 1000 ° to the east,
__label__0  we are in the nice village of Etoumbi, in the Republic of Congo.
__label__0  In Etoumbi it is 13:00 in the afternoon,
__label__0  because the sun was here at its highest point an hour ago.
__label__0  This is why we have time zones.
__label__0  Since the earth revolves every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.
__label__0  But wait a minute, I lied. The earth does not do 24 hours to do a round,
__label__0  That is because there are actually two definitions of 'one day'.
__label__0  The usual definition is a solar day.
__label__0  That is the time between 12:00 noon, when the sun is at its highest in the air.
__label__0  The more scientific definition is a star day.
__label__0  That is the time it takes the earth to turn 360 ° around its axis
__label__0  and therefore also the time it takes for a star to appear in the same place
__label__0  between one and the other day.
__label__0  There is a difference between star days and sunny days
__label__0  because the earth revolves around its own axis and around the sun.
__label__0  So, look at this.
__label__0  Let's put a point on a spot on the earth and flush a star day.
__label__0  You will see that the same point is not the closest yet
__label__0  is in the sun because the earth also revolves around the sun.
__label__0  To bring the point as close as possible to the sun,
__label__0  we have to go 4 minutes ahead and now one solar day has passed.
__label__0  Those 4 minutes count perfectly up to about 24 hours, spread over a year.
__label__0  This means that a star day is more than solar days per year.
__label__0  Okay, now we can go to Mars.
__label__0  That was quick.
__label__0  Mars is a planet that looks quite like the earth and time works in a similar way.
__label__0  It has a prime meridian ... here.
__label__0  Strangely enough, astronomers chose this prime meridian before it was chosen from the earth.
__label__0  According to the same principle as the Greenwich Mean Time,
__label__0  there is a coordinated Mars time called MTC.
__label__0  But in general, robot cars use Mars
__label__0  just the time of the place where they land.
__label__0  This is almost the same as how places on earth
__label__0  determined their time before coordinated time zones existed.
__label__0  Each place on earth determined the time with the highest position of the sun as 12:00 in the afternoon.
__label__0  However, this became difficult when ways were found to travel quickly between places,
__label__0  since nobody knew more then what time it was.
__label__0  If you want to know more about this, you can view my other video over time.
__label__0  Since there have only been 11 operational spacecraft on Mars,
__label__0  the use of times based on the sun has never caused problems.
__label__0  That means, however, that even the seconds are not coordinated between the different robot cars.
__label__0  What is a little tricky is that a day on Mars takes a little longer than a day on earth.
__label__0  Everyone who has watched The Martian, knows that a solar day on Mars is called a Sol.
__label__0  Robot trucks on Mars generally work only during the day,
__label__0  partly because some work on solar energy
__label__0  and partly because a lot of work is carried through cameras and enough light is needed.
__label__0  That is why the teams that run the robot cars on Mars from the earth live
__label__0  based on time on Mars.
__label__0  Their shifts shift every day for 40 minutes to coordinate it
__label__0  with the time that it is light on Mars.
__label__0  Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
__label__0  who has worked on the Spirit and Opportunity programs, says that
__label__0  scientists who work with robot trucks sometimes have two watches,
__label__0  one for the time on Mars and one for the time on earth.
__label__0  So when we go to Mars we have to create time zones and use the coordinated time.
__label__0  Having different time standards in different places always causes problems,
__label__0  especially for computers and communication.
__label__0  This is of course only one of the many details that we need to figure out before we start living on the red planet.
__label__0  I hope you enjoyed the episode of this week, it was a lot more instructive than last week's

__label__0  Thanks for watching and come back next week for more than The Wikipedia list.
__label__1 thank you to a group were known for
__label__1 sponsoring this video at CES 2018 you
__label__1 can check out there symbiosis concept
__label__1 car in the description down below we're
__label__0 talking with the Jenna vation KB 170 l
__label__0 and one other keyboard play you have to
__label__0 wait for that this one as you can see
__label__0 immediately has 66 macro keys at the top
__label__0 of the keyboard each one of those keys
__label__0 can take 220 character inputs you do
__label__0 that by switching a switch just right
__label__0 here on the back of the keyboard from
__label__0 program mode to keyboard mode and you
__label__0 can type all that kind of stuff in to
__label__0 program those individual keys there's
__label__0 only one profile for these keys but you
__label__0 easily switch to another mode by holding
__label__0 shift just like you would for any other
__label__0 key on the keyboard to switch to
__label__0 essentially another set of 66 more macro
__label__0 keys all of the keys at the top have
__label__0 these clear top covers on them so you
__label__0 can print out little cards for each one
__label__0 of them insert it under the top cover
__label__0 and then be able to reference what
__label__0 that's actually for in the future which
__label__0 is really helpful because well they're
__label__0 programmable keys so they're what you
__label__0 set them to not what they're
__label__0 pre-programmed for so they can't come
__label__0 with labels on them they are single-shot
__label__0 abs key caps naturally due to the cap on
__label__0 top of them and these standard qwerty
__label__0 keys are double shot key caps and I want
__label__0 to show you guys something right here
__label__0 this whole keyboard if I try to grab it
__label__0 pretty firmly on each side and try to
__label__0 twist it it essentially doesn't twist at
__label__0 all and I'm giving it quite a bit of
__label__0 force I have seen drastically more
__label__0 keyboard twists intend keyless keyboards
__label__0 that don't have three rows of macro keys
__label__0 above it then this one does it's it's
__label__0 build quite well there's a metal plate
__label__0 throughout the entire thing so ways to
__label__0 point to kilograms are four point eight
__label__0 five pounds that's a lot for a keyboard
__label__0 good for bashing zombies with or just
__label__0 staying where it's supposed to be on
__label__0 your desk they did however take some
__label__0 precautions and making it as compact as
__label__0 they could you can see compared to a
__label__0 standard keyboard there isn't this
__label__0 divide between the F keys and the normal
__label__0 core D keys they shrank that down
__label__0 whether that's a positive or negative
__label__0 I'm not entirely sure personally I think
__label__0 my muscle memory would make it so that
__label__0 when I go to press escape I would end up
__label__0 pressing this macro key in the corner
__label__0 but you know making the macro keys at
__label__0 the very top actually more pressable
__label__0 it's probably benefit for that so
__label__0 depends on you in terms of usability the
__label__0 switches are
__label__0 IMX blacks there's a USB pass-through
__label__0 port on the back of the keyboard and
__label__0 when you're in program mode there is a
__label__0 little light just next to numb log caps
__label__0 lock and scroll lock so that you know
__label__0 that you're in program mode and not
__label__0 typing though this keyboard was just
__label__0 announced at the show and will probably
__label__0 be available through Amazon but just in
__label__0 case you can get it at DSi - keyboards
__label__0 comm the backlit version will cost three
__label__0 hundred and forty dollars and the non
__label__0 backlit version will cost two eighty to
__label__0 ninety around there next up we have the
__label__0 lens in GK 358 which as you can see it's
__label__0 quite water resistant it's an IP 68
__label__0 rated keyboard meaning that it can be
__label__0 submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water
__label__0 for 30 minutes but they don't know the
__label__0 maximum depth that it can be submerged
__label__0 for because it's made for like spills
__label__0 and stuff not actually gaming underwater
__label__0 they did say however that it can be
__label__0 underwater to some degree for a boat up
__label__0 to a week which is pretty cool it's also
__label__0 only thirty bucks and features double
__label__0 shot injected key caps and back letting
__label__0 the backlighting is for different colors
__label__0 across the board not RGB LEDs but there
__label__0 is different lighting modes as well so
__label__0 if you hold the function key and press
__label__0 scroll lock it will change what lighting
__label__0 mode it's in we have experienced a
__label__0 couple glitches while sitting here but
__label__0 it seems to be only if you like get
__label__0 water on it and then lift it up
__label__0 vertically so the water goes up into the
__label__0 key caps that there is any problem so if
__label__0 you spill stuff on your keyboard maybe
__label__0 don't like pour the water into the top
__label__0 of the key caps and you'll probably be
__label__0 fine it does also feature an actually
__label__0 pretty nice colored metal top but there
__label__0 is a little bit of flex actually a fair
__label__0 amount of flex it is a thirty dollar
__label__0 keyboard so I maybe wouldn't worry about
__label__0 that too much this is the price range
__label__0 that you're shopping for
__label__0 it features an optical switch I have not
__label__0 personally seen before manufactured by a
__label__0 Taiwanese company called ever light
__label__0 other notable features is that there's
__label__0 RGB lighting along the sides of the
__label__0 keyboards which is pretty cool it's only
__label__0 two milliseconds of delay and this metal
__label__0 plate comes in either black or blue it
__label__0 will be available on Alibaba or BB r86
__label__1 comm so cool there's a keyboard that you
__label__1 can use literally underwater I'm typing
__label__1 right now and I can see it on the screen
__label__1 over there pretty sweet if you're more
__label__1 interested in things outside of the
__label__1 water whoever I'm gonna bring back our
__label__1 sponsor group run Ofra sponsoring this
__label__1 video
__label__1 lioness went to go check out their
__label__1 symbiote scar in France not that long
__label__1 ago and he was able to experience level
__label__1 4 automation that means he was able to
__label__1 sit in the driver's seat and not drive
__label__1 he just used his laptop while he was
__label__1 sitting there and it drove him down real
__label__1 roads in France with other cars on it
__label__1 really cool there's also tons of other
__label__1 cool tech inside of the car so be sure
__label__1 to check that out up here or possibly
__label__1 down in the link below see you guys next
__label__0 time like this video if you liked it
__label__0 dislike it if you dislike it get
__label__0 subscribe all that fun stuff and I
__label__0 already said I'll see you next time so I
__label__0 guess I don't really have anything else
__label__0 to say bye
__label__0  Flying is expensive. Why is this? Most will say by the cost of fuel
__label__0  but that's not quite right. The Airbus A320Neo can carry 24,000 liters of fuel. That is
__label__0  as much as 376 Toyota Camry's that have been refueled. For every mile and a half that the A320 flies,
__label__0  it consumes 6 liters of kerosene. That amounts to a void kilometer per 4 liters. An A320
__label__0  can hardly fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Termal on those four liters
__label__0  fuel. To fly the 340 kilometers from New York to DC, the A320 needs 1200 liters of fuel.
__label__0  With that amount, our Toyota Camry can drive 49 times from New York to LA. But we also have to think
__label__0  that our Camry has only 5 seats. An A320 has 154. So, assuming the plane
__label__0  fully loaded, it has a fuel efficiency of 170 kilometers per four liters per person.
__label__0  That is amazing! According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, airlines pay an average of only $ 1.24.
__label__0  per four liters of fuel. So, you even use only $ 2.50 of fuel, flying from New York to DC,
__label__0  so why do these tickets cost more than $ 80 ?! Well, there is a lot more
__label__0  the ticket price then only determines fuel. Before we start I just want to say this
__label__0  are already gross estimates. Many of these prices will vary greatly over time and there will be
__label__0  certainly way in which airlines reduce these costs, but this gives you a general idea
__label__0  what really makes flying so expensive. The first thing we can add to the airline ticket
__label__0  are the costs of the crew. A pilot earns an average of $ 79,000 per year, which amounts to about $ 44 per flight hour.
__label__0  We have two pilots for a one-hour flight from New York to DC
__label__0  that's $ 88 for the pilots. A fully loaded A320 needs four flight attendants,
__label__0  each à about $ 38 per hour, for a total of $ 152, representing the total cost of the crew
__label__0  $ 240 brings. So, with our 154 seats that comes down to about $ 1.50 per person in costs for the crew.
__label__0  Okay, now we're at $ 4. Then we have to pay for the airports.
__label__0  The JF Kennedy Airport in New York is asking for $ 6.33 per 500 kg plane that is taking off, and our A320
__label__0  weighs 86,000 kilos. That means we pay $ 1089 in JFK, or over $ 7 per person
__label__0  Dulles Airport does not show what its landing costs are, but we assume that it's about
__label__0  the same as the landing costs at JFK for our 86,000 kilos aircraft. These costs
__label__0  generally contain the costs of using gates, doormen and other facilities, and
__label__0  come down to $ 13.50 per person. Our total is now $ 17.50. Now comes the nice part - taxes.
__label__0  There is a long list of different taxes and they all vary per country,
__label__0  so for convenience we only deal with those for the US. The easiest load is the
__label__0  tax for domestic passenger transport at 7.5% of the ticket price. That money goes to the FAA.
__label__0  If you land or take off at an airport in the countryside, defined as "an airport with less than 100,000
__label__0  landings / starts during the second consecutive calendar year and is either 1) not located within 120 km
__label__0  from another airport with 100,000+ takeoffs / landings per year, 2) receives essential aviation subsidies
__label__0  or 3) is not connected to another airport connected by "a highway", then they also add
__label__0  7.5% more. That is obviously not applicable for both airports. The FAA also brings
__label__0  $ 4 for every flight within the US unless you fly to Hawaii or Alaska. Then they bring
__label__0  $ 8.70 in charge. The TSA then adds $ 5.60 in taxes, called the "9/11 security tax" that is used
__label__0  to pay for the increased security since 9/11. This is only for domestic flights.
__label__0  If we were to fly from New York to Paris we would also pay $ 17.70 as
__label__0  tax for international transport, $ 5.50 for customs costs, $ 5.00 for the
__label__0  "Animal and plant health inspection", $ 7.00 for Immigration and Naturalization supplement
__label__0  and $ 14 for the French Civil Aviation Tax. So, with all taxes and surcharges that apply
__label__0  for this short flight we are now at $ 33 in total. Let's not forget that planes
__label__0  expensive. Our A320 costs $ 170 million. The lifespan of aircraft is not really determined
__label__0  by the number of flight hours, it is determined by something we call "flight cycles",
__label__0  what the neat word is for one flight. It does not really matter how long it flies
__label__0  in its lifetime, which is how often it has been under pressure. This is
__label__0  because every time an aircraft has been under pressure micro cracks develop around the rivets
__label__0  connect the metal plates to form the hull. Regardless of whether the aircraft flies for 30 minutes
__label__0  or 9 o'clock, the wear and tear of the aircraft remains the same. This is why long-distance aircraft
__label__0  usually older. They only go through one flight cycle per day
__label__0  while small regional jets do 8 to 10. So, back to our A380. Our plane
__label__0  is actually a relatively sustainable aircraft. It can fly up to 60,000 cycles. If we are the
__label__0  dividing the total price of the aircraft by the maximum number of flight cycles, we arrive at $ 1783
__label__0  per flight required to pay the aircraft.
__label__0  Per person that comes down to $ 11.50. We are now at $ 44.50. To keep the plane safe,
__label__0  airlines also have to do regular maintenance. For a one-hour flight, a society must
__label__0  carry out maintenance at the cost of about $ 646 in working hours, $ 276 in parts, $ 603 in inspections and
__label__0  and another $ 596 on repairs to the engine. That is $ 2121 in total or $ 14 per passenger. We sit
__label__0  now at $ 58.50. We must also think of the part that is not flown.
__label__0  Every airline has a company that is a company and incurs costs in itself. They pay
__label__0  administrative staff, directors, software engineers, marketing staff, consultants,
__label__0  customer service staff, PR staff, cleaners, but also rent, benefits, travel costs,
__label__0  running costs and much more. It is difficult to put an exact amount on it and how much that costs
__label__0  per person, but we make a conservative estimate of $ 10. We are now at $ 68.50.
__label__0  OK, insurance. A company pays approximately $ 106,500 a year to insurance for an A320 and assuming that
__label__0  our plane is in the air 8 hours a day, this hour costs $ 36,
__label__0  or about 25 cents per person. So, our total amounts to $ 68.75.
__label__0  We round this off to $ 70 because we are a few small things that I have not treated
__label__0  such as hotel costs for the crew, aircraft storage, assistance, entitlement insurance, etc.
__label__0  That means that 10 $ of the plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that my estimates
__label__0  on the conservative side and that I assume that the device is completely full. Eventually it goes
__label__0  not a lot of money to society. Back to my first sentence "Flying is expensive".
__label__0  Well, actually it is not that expensive and it is also cheaper. To be able to fly in the magical iron bird over land
__label__0  from New York to LA in 6 hours costs about $ 340 return. In our very economical
__label__0  Toyota Camry to drive over land in 40 hours costs $ 340 alone
__label__0  to fuel and then an estimated $ 300 in maintenance and depreciation costs. In the
__label__0  last 30 years the ticket price for flying has dropped by 50% if you include the inflation, and the
__label__0  is still falling. In 1974 it was illegal to offer a flight between New York
__label__0  and LA ,. for less than $ 1442, including inflation, and now you can take these flights
__label__0  sometimes l find for less than $ 200 return. One of the reasons for this reduction
__label__0  in prices is the emergence of highly efficient aircraft. Some innovations such as plastic structures,
__label__0  better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and, perhaps most importantly, winglets, have the costs
__label__0  for flying significantly reduced. Here is the only real reason of "Real Engineering"
__label__0  explain the winglets.
__label__0  As you said, the aviation industry is constantly looking for ways to reduce the cost of their fuel consumption.
__label__0  In the early 1970s fuel prices rose explosively, and engineers were obliged to find new ways
__label__0  to make their aircraft more efficient. One of them was the winglets, those are those small ones
__label__0  curved pieces at the end of the wing. Let's see how they work quickly. Winglets were
__label__0  introduced to lower induced air resistance, which occurs when high pressure is under the wing
__label__0  overflows to the low pressure above it. This flow creates swirls
__label__0  the tips of the wings that create resistance and reduce the upward pressure, which in turn is the fuel efficiency
__label__0  of the plane. Winglets are there to reduce these eddies through the airflow over the
__label__0  edge of the wing. For a full explanation you have to look at the history of the winglets, go
__label__0  to my channel and watch my new video where a special guest is
__label__0  Wendover Productions does his story.
__label__0  Thank you Real Engineering! Be sure to check out the Real Engineering channel and subscribe.
__label__0  If you like this channel, I guarantee you will like it too. I leave you with
__label__0  the real reason why certain tickets are so expensive, but also a reason why they become cheaper - competition
__label__0  or the lack of it. The aviation industry is one with very little competition. Ticket prices
__label__0  from New York to LA are cheap because there is a lot of demand and there is relative
__label__0  lots of competition. Five different airlines fly directly from New York to LA, two
__label__0  of these are budget companies. People often do not care what society they fly with, they do
__label__0  find the price more important, so companies will try to match the prices of the budget airlines.
__label__0  Compare this with a route like Denver - Gunnison Country. Especially because only United
__label__0  offering this flight will often cost you more than $ 500 for a flight of 210 km.
__label__0  So, that's why tickets are so expensive. Next time you book a wicker, you will
__label__0  know why you pay so much and how little of it actually goes to the airline.

__label__1 thank you daddy Brad for sponsoring our
__label__1 CES 2018 content check out there's six
__label__1 skins in the link down below
__label__0 we're here at high Perkin checking out
__label__0 three awesome up-and-coming projects the
__label__0 first one however is project Ultra GB
__label__0 which is a current name not a final name
__label__0 but we'll use that for now it's an
__label__0 all-aluminum Gameboy that includes a ton
__label__0 of awesome features like type-c charging
__label__0 an RGB switching wheel to change the
__label__0 color of the included backlight an
__label__0 included audio amplifier left and right
__label__0 audio channel output and potentially LS
__label__0 DJ software coming from the start we're
__label__0 not sure on that yet this is all because
__label__0 it's being made with chip tune fanatics
__label__0 in mind
__label__0 my favorite feature however is the og
__label__0 dot matrix display it looks awesome when
__label__0 you actually do things on the Gameboy it
__label__0 looks fantastic I like that they went
__label__0 that extra step and made sure that it
__label__0 was that much of an original product it
__label__0 is gonna come in at hopefully slightly
__label__0 under $100 but it looks great it sounds
__label__0 great it feels great I just I'm I'm a
__label__0 fan next up for the Atari 2600 fans out
__label__0 there we have the retron 77 this is a
__label__0 modern console so you have HDMI
__label__0 1080p ode 16 by 9 aspect ratio or 4 by 3
__label__0 but then it has the nice things that
__label__0 you'd expect from an Atari 2600 like
__label__0 difficulty changing a black and white
__label__0 switch the option to have savestates
__label__0 which I guess wasn't in the original but
__label__0 you have now which is very nice because
__label__0 could be really frustrating to not have
__label__0 those in terms of firmware its
__label__0 officially licensed ella emulation so
__label__0 you'll load the rom from the cartridge
__label__0 onto the drive and stella will make sure
__label__0 that it all works ok and there will be
__label__0 updates from high Perkin themselves but
__label__0 you can also load your own firmware onto
__label__0 the device if you would like as it is
__label__0 open source and last but not least we
__label__0 have the mega retron HD which as you may
__label__0 guess is for Genesis and Mega Drive
__label__0 systems although it's not emulation this
__label__0 is just straight-up standard hardware
__label__0 with 100% compatibility across the board
__label__0 in terms of modern features you have
__label__0 720p output over an HDMI connector 16 by
__label__0 9 and 4 by 3 aspect ratio switches and
__label__0 an NTSC pal switch to make sure that'll
__label__0 work for you also there's a controller
__label__0 in the box just like with the retro and
__label__0 77 now as you guys know I'm a Nintendo
__label__0 and Game Boy fanboy so I'm pretty
__label__0 excited for project ultra GB but if
__label__0 you're more of a Sega or Atari
__label__0 let me know in the comments down below
__label__1 and thank you to D Brandt for sponsoring
__label__1 this video and all of our CES 2018
__label__1 content they have awesome 3m vinyl skins
__label__1 I can go on your phone your laptop many
__label__1 other devices as well they have a bunch
__label__1 of different textured stuff like their
__label__1 dragon skin or their wood and they even
__label__1 have marble finishes as well it looks
__label__1 awesome and it also protects your device
__label__1 from scratches or dents which is cool
__label__1 it's not quite a case but they also have
__label__1 those if you're interested as well again
__label__1 check it out D brand calm /c es 2018 I
__label__0 like the video if you liked it dislike
__label__0 it if you're like why the heck did the
__label__0 light just turn off and stay subscribe
__label__0 to see all the rest of our CES 2018
__label__0 content I'll see you next time
__label__1 thank you daddy brand for sponsoring our
__label__1 CES 2018 content check out there are six
__label__1 skins and the link down below
__label__0 and speaking of SiC we're here at
__label__0 verdaguer they have their awesome chairs
__label__0 you guys probably know of them already
__label__0 they can go left and right they can go
__label__0 up and down they can go all the way back
__label__0 there just catches me out every time but
__label__0 it worked it's fine they support even me
__label__0 which is actually a good sign
__label__0 but what's new here today is the RGB
__label__0 lighting powered by NZXT cam software so
__label__0 you can control it on your desktop and
__label__0 it wirelessly connects to the chair it's
__label__0 all nicely done it has charging through
__label__0 the back with a breakaway cable so if
__label__0 you're like running if you're away from
__label__0 your computer and suddenly you have to
__label__0 be like oh my god this squads on
__label__0 counter-strike you can jump into your
__label__0 care chair hit colton while you're doing
__label__0 it the cable will break away and you
__label__0 don't have to worry about the cable
__label__0 breaking you have to worry about the
__label__0 chair breaking everything is fine you
__label__0 can charge your chair that way but if
__label__0 you do happen to forget to plug in that
__label__0 super fancy cable you can just swap in
__label__0 for more 18 650 batteries the same ones
__label__0 in your vape if you're into that so you
__label__0 might have a few around those could be
__label__0 externally rechargeable you could have
__label__0 an extra set waiting just in case you
__label__0 forget to plug it in and then you would
__label__0 be good to go again just through this
__label__0 nice little simple port on the back the
__label__0 batteries would go in there in terms of
__label__0 lighting modes it is powered by cam
__label__0 software like I previously mentioned so
__label__0 you have all your standard RGB lighting
__label__0 modes as you can see here we're just
__label__0 cycling through a bunch of colors so
__label__0 it's also breathing and everything else
__label__0 you would expect from an RGB product but
__label__0 then they also have a really cool
__label__0 counterstrike mode which we aren't
__label__0 currently displaying but you'll be
__label__0 seeing through b-roll it shows stuff
__label__0 like when you die it's red if you're at
__label__0 full health it's green and it gradients
__label__0 all the way through to paying on what
__label__0 health percentage you're at if you are
__label__0 flash banged it'll go white if you stand
__label__0 in smoke it'll go gray if the bomb is
__label__0 currently ticking it will go yellow and
__label__0 tick with the bomb and then when it's 10
__label__0 seconds left in the bomb it'll go red
__label__0 and tick with the bomb still which is
__label__0 actually a really cool feature so at
__label__0 this point in time I don't know what it
__label__0 will cost I don't know if it will show
__label__0 up as an upgrade kit or if it will be
__label__0 natively in the chairs or possibly both
__label__0 we'll have to find out at a later date
__label__0 another thing that they launched here
__label__0 was coffee fibre material for headrests
__label__0 and lumbar support cushions as long with
__label__0 an entire chair if you decide to get the
__label__0 one that I'm sitting in right now what
__label__0 the heck is coffee fiber material well
__label__0 it's actually a synthetic material
__label__0 with coffee fiber layered on top of it
__label__0 and what this does is it absorbs odors
__label__0 it dries faster so if you get a little
__label__0 sweaty when you're sitting in your chair
__label__0 it will absorb that and dry that much
__label__0 more quickly which is cool it's common
__label__0 in sportswear and clothes because of
__label__0 again odors and whatnot and it's good
__label__0 because if you think about what is
__label__0 currently sitting on your chair
__label__0 absorbing those odors it's probably a
__label__0 good idea
__label__0 also the vertigo your logos on these
__label__0 things it's a silver coated threading so
__label__0 that will also kill 99% of germs and
__label__0 bacteria which is great so if you're
__label__0 interested in any of the stuff that we
__label__0 talked about here today the RGB the
__label__0 coffee fiber whatever keep an eye out at
__label__0 verdaguer comm they'll be launching
__label__1 their products there and also thank you
__label__1 to Dee Brandt for sponsoring this video
__label__1 and all of our CES 2018 content they
__label__1 have awesome 3m vinyl skins I can go on
__label__1 your phone your laptop many other
__label__1 devices as well be sure to check out
__label__1 their website at D brand comm forward
__label__1 slash CES 2018 there we go they have a
__label__1 bunch of different textured stuff like
__label__1 their dragon skin or their wood and they
__label__1 even have marble finishes as well it
__label__1 looks awesome and it also protects your
__label__1 device from scratches or dents which is
__label__1 cool it's not quite a case but they also
__label__1 have those if you're interested as well
__label__1 again check it out D brand calm forward
__label__1 slash CES 2018 and yeah if you liked the
__label__0 video like it he just liked the video
__label__0 dislike it safe subscribe so you can see
__label__0 all of our content at CES this year I am
__label__0 sure there will be lots of our GB
__label__0 lighting so if you're into that keep
__label__0 watching I'll see you next time
__label__0  There is no clear definition of what makes something a country. What makes a country a country
__label__0  is that other countries agree that it is a country.
__label__0  For this reason the counts of the number of countries are running around the world
__label__0  range from 189 to 196. Each country decides for itself which other countries they recognize as a country. When 100 member states of the UN
__label__0  suddenly recognizing that your cellar is a country, then it will generally be
__label__0  accepted that this is so. There are, however, a number of steps
__label__0  that every future country founder must go through if they want to make a chance
__label__0  internationally recognized.
__label__0  The first thing you need to start with is one
__label__0  land is a piece of land. A possible way to get that is to steal it. Of course this means you
__label__0  have sufficient weapons to defend your own terrain. It could also become problematic when your
__label__0  country enters the stage where it is judged by other nations, but this method
__label__0  has worked before. An easier method is to claim unattended land. However, due to the attendance
__label__0  from satellite photos and modern cartography, there are virtually no islands or large ones
__label__0  areas that have not yet been discovered. Nevertheless, there is a small number of places that are not yet controlled
__label__0  or has been claimed by a recognized government. A well-known and recent example is
__label__0  an area not claimed by Croatia and Serbia, near the river Danube, the border between
__label__0  the two countries. This micronation, known as Liberland, is not international
__label__0  recognized and accused by a number of nations, but it claims to be a valid state
__label__0  because the piece of land has not been claimed before. The territory is 17 times larger
__label__0  than the area of ​​the small recognized country, the Vatican. Serbia has admitted than Liberland
__label__0  did not come to their field, but also dismissed the attempt as frivolous.
__label__0  Other new nations have had more success in obtaining international recognition. Most of these are
__label__0  partially recognized nations that have been split off from an already recognized state with support from
__label__0  the people within the territory. An example of this is South Ossetia, which split off
__label__0  Georgia in 1990 and is currently recognized by Russia, Nicaraqua, Venezuela and Nauru.
__label__0  Perhaps the most famous and fiercely contested newly established nation is State of Palestine.
__label__0  136 nations recognize Palestine and in 2012 it was designated by the United Nations
__label__0  as an 'observation state without membership'. Another option for unattended land is Antarctica.
__label__0  A large part of the country, known as Marie Byrdland, has not yet been claimed by a recognized
__label__0  nation. A problem with this option is the United Nations Antarctic Treaty,
__label__0  that states that there is' no new claim, or extension of an existing claim, with respect to territorial sovereignty
__label__0  will be made as long as the treaty is in force '. There are claims that already existed before
__label__0  the treaty, from 7 different states, but its validity is controversial
__label__0  because of the treaty. In addition to the problem with the Antarctic Treaty, it would establish a sovereign nation
__label__0  in Antarctica are difficult because of the next step in the process.
__label__0  A nation is created to serve its people,
__label__0  so without people there is no nation. There are always
__label__0  people in Antarctica, but they do not form a permanent population because
__label__0  they are mainly there for research or tourism and no one stays longer in Antarctica than one
__label__0  a few years. Interestingly, there are 11 babies born in Antarctica, but they generally have
__label__0  the nationality of their parents' country adopted. A permanent population is one of the
__label__0  first requirements to become a state. A sustainable, independent nation would be almost impossible
__label__0  in Antarctica. Every settlement would have no real economy and no natural way
__label__0  to produce food. However, there are rumors that there is oil in Antarctica and if this is the case, one would
__label__0  sovereign and possibly prosperous nation can be erected in this hostile environment, just like
__label__0  the United Arab Emirates. Like the dozens of micronation claims in Antarctica,
__label__0  Liberland lacks a permanent population. The founders are attempting the area
__label__0  reintroduced have been blocked by both Serbia and Croatia. At this moment it is unlikely
__label__0  that there will be a permanent population in the near future and for this reason the
__label__0  future of Liberland uncertain.
__label__0  A well-formed government is perhaps the most
__label__0  determining factor that determines the success of your new country. There are many forms
__label__0  from government, but since you are establishing this country in the 21st century, you will
__label__0  Probably base the government on John Locke's government principles. Locke's principles
__label__0  basically say that, in general, everyone has the right to "Life, Health, Freedom,
__label__0  or Possession '. You may recognize a similarity between this and another famous document.
__label__0  According to Locke, in a natural society - that is one without government, these rights
__label__0  not protected because there is no higher power to do this. So in exchange for taking away
__label__0  some of these rights, for example Freedom when you get in jail or Property when you pay taxes,
__label__0  the government protects the same rights. Locke also says that the government only works
__label__0  when there is a common belief in the abstract idea or illusion of a government and that is why
__label__0  a government can only really exist when one is behind it. This is the reason that
__label__0  autocratic or absolutist governments rarely work in a modern society. So, with these principles
__label__0  in the back of your mind, you now need a constitution. Every recognized country in the world
__label__0  has either a constitution or a similar document. This is not a complicated process,
__label__0  I will not go into details too much, but in essence everyone has to land a number
__label__0  laws, principles and entities that together form the land and the constitution is all about it
__label__0  define and specify it.
__label__0  This is where you examine all your work critically.
__label__0  Obtaining international recognition is by far the most difficult step in the process of creating
__label__0  a country. It may take hundreds of years for new countries to be complete or almost
__label__0  fully recognized. Chances are that unless you have full support from the people
__label__0  in your country, a good reason for the creation of your new nation, completely
__label__0  undisputed terrain and a well-balanced democratic government, you are recognized
__label__0  by no UN member state. The chance of a new, well-recognized nation outside of Africa
__label__0  or the Balkans is unlikely. The governments are too well organized and stable outside
__label__0  these areas. The last step to get undisputed recognition is to be admitted to the United
__label__0  Nations. Each application is handled by the Security Council - which consists of China, France,
__label__0  the Russian Federation, the United States of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the
__label__0  United States of America and a varying group of 10 other countries. As 10 of 15 votes before admission
__label__0  of your country - congratulations - you have just joined the United Nations. By most
__label__0  you are now seen as a country. Of course, other members of the United Nations can still opt for you
__label__0  to recognize and there are enough UN member states that are not fully recognized. That is, however
__label__0  a topic for another time. So success with your new country, thanks for watching and
__label__0  see you next time.
__label__1 thanks to iFixit for sponsoring this
__label__1 video check out their pro tect toolkit
__label__1 at ifixit.com forward slash Lynas for
__label__1 free solid generations digital storm has
__label__0 been making their small form-factor
__label__0 gaming computers bigger and bigger for
__label__0 some inexplicable reason but that all
__label__0 changes today they're showing off the
__label__0 Modena the event MX and the V locks X
__label__0 and those ones are pretty cool but this
__label__0 this is the star of the show this is the
__label__0 digital storm spark the kind of small
__label__0 form-factor gaming machine that I might
__label__0 have designed after I first laid eyes on
__label__0 many STX hardware back at Computex last
__label__0 year so inside this tiny box like look
__label__0 at this this is an event of extra scale
__label__0 like come on inside this tiny box you'll
__label__0 find tons of storage expansion that is
__label__0 three MDOT two slots and a two and a
__label__0 half inch drive bay you will find up to
__label__0 a core i7 8700 K you will find up to a
__label__0 gtx 1080 graphics card up to 32 gigs of
__label__0 ram and yes my friends that is full
__label__0 custom hardline water cooling with RGB
__label__0 lighting so they've done a couple of
__label__0 cool things to get that kind of hardware
__label__0 into this form factor number one is they
__label__0 have actually worked with Swift tech to
__label__0 design a custom block for the MXM
__label__0 graphics card that is used by this mini
__label__0 STX form factor number two is they're
__label__0 using super compact 92 millimeter
__label__0 radiator up here in the top as well as a
__label__0 one of the smallest pump reservoir
__label__0 combos that I have ever seen up there
__label__0 and number three is that they've
__label__0 designed their own custom chassis which
__label__0 by the time this is released in knock on
__label__0 wood quarter 2 of 2018
__label__0 will have tempered glass for the side
__label__0 panels on both sides it's digital storm
__label__0 so it's not going to be cheap once it's
__label__0 available you'll be able to customize
__label__0 not just the color of your coolant but
__label__0 even the color of the chassis with any
__label__0 one of their great paint jobs and while
__label__0 it's
__label__0 storm so this thing is not gonna be
__label__0 cheap if you're a gamer on the go and
__label__0 you don't like the laptop paradigm this
__label__0 looks like a pretty compact option this
__label__1 video from CES was brought to you guys
__label__1 by iFixit yes my friends at his courtesy
__label__1 of iFixit and their Pro Tech tool kit
__label__1 that I am able to cause the usual havoc
__label__1 that I do here at the show taking apart
__label__1 everyone's prototypes be they desktops
__label__1 laptops hell why don't we take apart a
__label__1 monitor this year I mean the sky's the
__label__1 limit because it's got everything from
__label__1 pry tools to sputters to suction cups to
__label__1 their 64 bit driver kit that means that
__label__1 you will never get stumped by a random
__label__1 screw that you just don't have that bit
__label__1 on you right now as long as you don't
__label__1 lose them so check them out at the link
__label__1 in the video description and a huge
__label__1 thanks to iFixit for allowing us to be
__label__1 here at CES 2018 thanks for watching
__label__0 guys if you dislike to do that if you
__label__0 like hit like if you really like to get
