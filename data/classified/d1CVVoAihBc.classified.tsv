384730	only 190 are actually owned by Liberians 0
388419	foreigners register their ships there 0

394690	for the same reason with 1437 foreign 0
398560	owned ships malta is a European Union 0

420100	to New Zealand 101 214 though so they're 0
422800	not that good New Zealand has a kind of 0
424960	territory of new way it's recognized as 0
427060	a freely associated state meaning by 0
428950	choice but new way isn't recognized by 0
431200	the UN as an independent country however 0

436210	of the world from Niger which is named 0
437979	for the Niger River the Niger River has 0
439960	probably the most bizarre River course 0

469810	African country they also have what 0
471910	might be the coolest flag in the world 0
473950	except for maybe st. Lucia's but I do 0
476289	have to give a solid runners-up position 0
478060	to st. Vincent and the Grenadines Saint 0
480490	Vincent and the Grenadines name is 0
481870	rather purposefully similar to that of 0
483430	its neighbouring Island Grenada 0

486750	1985 but nowadays you can fly to places 0
489639	like Port of Spain in Trinidad and 0
491349	Tobago Trinidad is also the name of a 0

506200	Ivory Coast the Cote d'Ivoire is almost 0
508419	always referred to by this name since 0
510400	its government refuses to accept any 0
512078	translated name if you draw a straight 0
513969	line south from Cote d'Ivoire 0
515169	until it crosses 0
515919	Antartica and goes north you'll end up 0
517690	intersecting Vanuatu which is one of 0
519490	seven countries worldwide to not be part 0
521740	of the International Criminal Police 0
523029	organization also known as Interpol 0

554949	covered Paraguay which is another one of 0
556720	these landlocked countries with a navy 0
558130	and with that we've touched on every 0
560649	South American country if you dig a hole 0
562420	through the earth from Paraguay you end 0
564100	up just north of Philippines which is 0
565870	our seventh to last Asian country the 0
568449	other ones are Myanmar which is one of 0
570010	the world's three countries not using 0
