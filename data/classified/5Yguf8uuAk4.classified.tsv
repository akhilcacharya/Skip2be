1500	CES 2018 content check out there are six 1
3780	skins and the link down below 1
5069	and speaking of SiC we're here at 0
6720	verdaguer they have their awesome chairs 0
8550	you guys probably know of them already 0
9840	they can go left and right they can go 0
11340	up and down they can go all the way back 0
13590	there just catches me out every time but 0
15240	it worked it's fine they support even me 0
16980	which is actually a good sign 0
18449	but what's new here today is the RGB 0
21480	lighting powered by NZXT cam software so 0
24600	you can control it on your desktop and 0
26279	it wirelessly connects to the chair it's 0
27990	all nicely done it has charging through 0
30269	the back with a breakaway cable so if 0
32340	you're like running if you're away from 0
34710	your computer and suddenly you have to 0
36420	be like oh my god this squads on 0
38100	counter-strike you can jump into your 0
39719	care chair hit colton while you're doing 0
41820	it the cable will break away and you 0
43770	don't have to worry about the cable 0
44700	breaking you have to worry about the 0
45690	chair breaking everything is fine you 0
47340	can charge your chair that way but if 0
48899	you do happen to forget to plug in that 0
50820	super fancy cable you can just swap in 0
53399	for more 18 650 batteries the same ones 0
56460	in your vape if you're into that so you 0
58590	might have a few around those could be 0
60239	externally rechargeable you could have 0
61680	an extra set waiting just in case you 0
63329	forget to plug it in and then you would 0
65400	be good to go again just through this 0
66810	nice little simple port on the back the 0
69000	batteries would go in there in terms of 0
70860	lighting modes it is powered by cam 0
72659	software like I previously mentioned so 0
74340	you have all your standard RGB lighting 0
76200	modes as you can see here we're just 0
77970	cycling through a bunch of colors so 0
79200	it's also breathing and everything else 0
80820	you would expect from an RGB product but 0
83400	then they also have a really cool 0
84930	counterstrike mode which we aren't 0
86880	currently displaying but you'll be 0
88110	seeing through b-roll it shows stuff 0
89610	like when you die it's red if you're at 0
91950	full health it's green and it gradients 0
93869	all the way through to paying on what 0
95040	health percentage you're at if you are 0
96750	flash banged it'll go white if you stand 0
99240	in smoke it'll go gray if the bomb is 0
101280	currently ticking it will go yellow and 0
103740	tick with the bomb and then when it's 10 0
106079	seconds left in the bomb it'll go red 0
107579	and tick with the bomb still which is 0
108930	actually a really cool feature so at 0
110670	this point in time I don't know what it 0
112290	will cost I don't know if it will show 0
114000	up as an upgrade kit or if it will be 0
115649	natively in the chairs or possibly both 0
118200	we'll have to find out at a later date 0
120360	another thing that they launched here 0
121950	was coffee fibre material for headrests 0
124350	and lumbar support cushions as long with 0
126479	an entire chair if you decide to get the 0
128369	one that I'm sitting in right now what 0
129959	the heck is coffee fiber material well 0
132000	it's actually a synthetic material 0
133830	with coffee fiber layered on top of it 0
135960	and what this does is it absorbs odors 0
138120	it dries faster so if you get a little 0
140520	sweaty when you're sitting in your chair 0
141780	it will absorb that and dry that much 0
143880	more quickly which is cool it's common 0
145950	in sportswear and clothes because of 0
147870	again odors and whatnot and it's good 0
149700	because if you think about what is 0
151590	currently sitting on your chair 0
153390	absorbing those odors it's probably a 0
155490	good idea 0
156240	also the vertigo your logos on these 0
158340	things it's a silver coated threading so 0
160890	that will also kill 99% of germs and 0
163110	bacteria which is great so if you're 0
165990	interested in any of the stuff that we 0
