23760	gaming monitors that are big have 0
25529	already existed for quite some time 0
27240	and there are even PC monitors that are 0
29429	as large as 42 inches though it should 0
32460	be noted that there are only a few 0
33890	outliers that you could really consider 0
36090	to be gaming monitors that are 30 inches 0
39090	or above well that all changes today the 0
43170	65 inch monstrosity behind me checks off 0
46620	a ton of the boxes from our video 0
50370	earlier this year where we designed our 0
52980	ideal gaming TV so it's got really low 0
56820	latency like super low like a monitor 0
59670	it's got DisplayPort and HDMI input just 0
62489	like a monitor it's got a hundred and 0
64470	twenty Hertz max refresh rate just like 0
67140	a monitor and like a high-end gaming 0
70680	monitor it supports variable refresh 0
73140	rate with Nvidia g-sync technology so 0
76350	they're announcing three different 0
77820	models but all of them are using a VA 0
79650	panel from a you Optronics with quantum 0
82320	dot film four DCI p3 color support and 0
85340	nice deep black levels they're also 0
87900	using a full array back light solution 0
90869	with local dimming in order to achieve 0
93150	1000 nits peak brightness with the 0
95430	ability to support HDR now they haven't 0
97920	announced plans for Dolby vision at this 0
99479	time but it should be noted that most 0
101610	games maybe there's an exception or two 0
103829	you guys can leave a comment if you can 0
105060	think of anything but most games are 0
107040	supporting HDR through HDR 10 anyway 0
109560	let's talk results now they haven't 0
112020	announced how many local dimming zones 0
114180	these TVs have but if I had to guess I'd 0
116790	say it's probably similar to the 4k high 0
119280	refresh rate monitors that they talked 0
121500	about at CES last year so more than tens 0
125969	but probably not you know over a 0
128818	thousand something along those lines and 0
130889	in terms of results well local dimming 0
133500	is still not oled so that's a thing you 0
138210	can see blooms around bright objects in 0
141210	very dark scenes from time to time and 0
143400	it was especially noticeable in menus or 0
145440	if you have a bright moving light moving 0
148560	around your character like let's say 0
150240	like a navvy type assistant but if 0
152880	that's the case you've probably got more 0
154530	annoying things in your life and in 0
155880	general and fast paced situations we 0
158010	didn't really notice it while gaming now 0
160410	let's take a look at the back of a sirs 0
162540	prototype here these are absolutely 0
166430	prototypes so I guess the other thing to 0
169050	consider is that you've got to give them 0
170190	some time to improve it so they're 0
171840	announcing three partners Acer Asus and 0
174420	HP who are gonna launch displays 0
176310	hopefully sometime in the summer and 0
178020	it's up to those guys how they want to 0
179640	finish the screen matte or glossy how 0
181680	they want to do the stand the sound the 0
183630	bezel and the OSD options but in terms 0
186750	of the actual performance of the panel 0
188370	they're all using the same panel so it 0
190470	should be pretty similar okay then so I 0
194040	mean it's a TV realistically the 0
195989	expectation would be that you can use it 0
197670	for more than just gaming so Nvidia 0
199739	solution to that is to integrate a 0
202049	shield TV so they're full standalone 0
205530	device experience into the display and 0
208530	this is another thing that was in our 0
210150	video why don't you just have a high end 0
212459	thing built into the thing why are they 0
213930	why are they laggy it's ridiculous so 0
215670	Amazon and Netflix both have 4k HDR 0
219090	support and now you've got full 0
220860	integration with Google smart home and 0
222510	Google Voice which is pretty big and 0
224430	this is another announcement today that 0
226410	just like someone mentioned in passing I 0
228269	was like what really g-sync is now 0
230730	supported with game stream and in 0
233220	android games on shield TV though it 0
237030	should be noted you can't just plug your 0
238530	existing shield TV into your TV or your 0
240570	monitor because it only has HDMI out and 0
243110	gsync on the desktop anyway at this time 0
245640	is only supported over DisplayPort 0
247910	another cool thing for the TV guys not 0
250470	the gaming guys out there is video 0
251730	playback thanks to variable refresh rate 0
253650	is done at the native frame rate so if 0
256380	you're watching cinematic content it'll 0
258060	be running at 24 fps or if you're 0
260040	running something like the Grand Tour on 0
261599	Amazon then you will actually see it at 0
263940	the 25 fps that it was shot at No 0
266970	stupid interpolation no pulldown no 0
269220	nothing like that 0
270120	so let us know what you guys think in 0
273120	the comments is couch gaming finally 0
275280	here we've got low latency wireless mice 0
277890	we've got wireless keyboards we've got 0
281010	actual gaming TVs is it time well it's 0
285090	gonna depend on your budget like I said 0
286800	it's coming this summer and Nvidia is 0
288600	not commenting on pricing at all so I'm 0
291750	just gonna have to wildly speculate 0
293340	based on what I know about a typical 0
294750	g-sync up charge over a decent monitor 0
297060	and say I wouldn't expect these to be 0
298350	less than probably around 5 grand so let 0
301200	me know what you guys think you're gonna 0
302640	see and what you would pay at the 0
305010	comment section at the comment section 0
