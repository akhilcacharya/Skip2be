110909	a half inch drive those drives would go 0
112110	on the inside so you actually close the 0

136409	aluminum plate which is great because 0
138390	all the areas that you're really going 0
139709	to be focusing on when you look at this 0
141269	case the front and the inside are 0
143760	covered by tempered glass and aluminum I 0
145890	mentioned earlier how you could buy the 0
147150	O 11 dynamic with three RGB fans 0
149700	included that brings us to their update 0
151980	of their Borah line of fans we're gonna 0
154530	start with the Borah plus 120 a three 0
157260	kit of these with their addressable RGB 0
159659	version which you can control through 0

173040	the controller now if you step down from 0
175230	there get the same three awesome fans 0
177389	but it's you it's managed by an external 0
180000	physical controller that's $69.99 for 0
183060	the three fans and the controller and 0
184650	then if you step down from there again 0

190620	plus you get what I'm going to call and 0
193109	they've been kind of saying around here 0
194609	the Borah light but that is not the 0
196169	official name for it and that's this guy 0
198269	I actually personally to possibly their 0
201090	dismay think that it might look better 0
202739	because the RGB is on the inside the 0
205410	LEDs I should say on the inside are 0
207930	actually hidden by the middle sticker 0
209310	and it looks like the fan is just 0
211019	glowing from nothing which i think is 0
212790	really cool that is managed by your 0
214980	motherboard through just a simple PWM 0
217109	connector and is $39 for three of them 0
220230	the O 11 dynamic and the new Borah fans 0
223319	are both cheaper than I expected much 0
