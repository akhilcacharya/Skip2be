30	Sup you beautiful bastards hope youre having a 0
2290	fantastic Wednesday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it and the first thing we're gonna talk about today is 0
8069	the news and seemingly meaningful updates around the Donald Trump stormy Daniels Michael Cohen situation 0
13889	So we've talked about this story several times in the past it initially started as this weird a tabloid gossip piece 0
18900	I didn't want to type but as more and more information comes out of the more 0
21840	It seems sketchy the more it seems like there 0
23910	There is something 0
24670	Meaningful here and to bring you up to speed there are news reports alleging that stormy Daniels had sex with Donald Trump at a country 0
29670	Club in 2006 while he was married to Melania along with that 0
32910	We saw reports that said Donald Trump paid stormy Daniels 0
35800	130 thousand dollars to keep quiet now in response to this the White House denies it Michael Cohen Donald Trump's lawyer releases a letter that 0
42120	Appears to be signed by stormy Daniels letter denies it but soon after in touch magazine says they have an unpublished 0
47050	Interview with stormy Daniels they published it the interview goes into incredible 0
50289	Detail was then reported by the Wall Street Journal that Michael Cohen actually created a shell company to pay 0
55719	stormy 0
56289	Daniels's lawyer that you might remember Cohen 0
58510	Responded her obsessive drive to prove a false narrative one that has been rebuked by all parties must come to an end following that On 0
64260	January 30th another letter is released it appears to be signed once again by stormy Daniels although many people questioned 0
70350	How real it was because the signature on this letter appeared different than the one from the first letter 0
75220	Discrepancy between the signatures on the letters is also brought up during a Jimmy Kimmel Live interview that that is very weird 0
81090	Did you sign this letter that was released today? I? 0
84820	Don't know wait a minute that you can say 0
88869	You know where it came from do you have any idea? 0
91439	I do not you do not know where it came from all of that brings us to the big news from the past 24 hours 0
95380	Where Michael Cohen has now openly admitted he paid? 0
99400	$130,000 to stormy Daniels real name Stephanie Clifford Cohen saying in a statement. I am mr. 0
103920	Trump's longtime special counsel 0
105509	And I have proudly served in that role for more than a decade in a private transaction in 0
109119	2016 I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of one hundred thirty thousand dollars to miss Stephanie Clifford neither the Trump 0
115689	Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Miss Clifford and neither 0
119829	Reimbursed me for the payment either directly or indirectly the payments miss Clifford was lawful and was not a campaign contribution 0
125350	or a campaign 0
126549	Expenditure by anyone Cohen also said he gave a similar statement to the Federal Election Commission after they received a complaint from the government watch 0
132270	Group common cause they alleged the money paid to Daniel's was an unreported in kind 0
136180	contribution and expenditure by president from 2016 presidential campaign and on that note in Cohen's statement 0
141210	He says the complaint alleges that I somehow violated campaign finance laws by facilitating an excess and kind 0
146110	Contribution the allegations in the complaint are factually unsupported and without legal merit and my counsel has submitted a response to the FEC 0
151950	I mean just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage. I will always protect mr. 0
156780	Trump and then he would not answer any follow-up questions now the reason this is big news is it appears that everyone has just been 0
162330	lying and misleading the public a Cohen's own admission the the reporting seems to have been real one hundred thirty thousand dollars was paid to 0
169300	Stormy, Daniel, which you could say that doesn't prove that it was in exchange for an NDA 0
173100	But why what why what? 0
174550	Other reason would Donald Trump's legal counsel pay a pornstar one hundred thirty thousand dollars out of his own money 0
180600	And so what appears going East right now to do is is no longer to deny that money was paid that was essentially hush money 0
185940	He's now moved to the argument of the money that was paid was definitely not 0
189040	Illegal so sometimes people pay other people hush money for things that didn't actually have also point 0
193050	That's really important 0
193800	Here is common causes 0
194740	Cohen's response doesn't dismiss the complaint saying as Trump's personal attorney Cohen was an agent of then candidate Trump timing in circumstances of the one 0
201720	Hundred thirty thousand dollar payment to Daniel's make it appear that the hush money was paid to Daniel's in an effort to influence the election 0
206709	Adding at the very least this latest submission by Cohen in the circumstances behind it requires a full investigation 0
211150	By the FEC and the Department of Justice as we requested last month 0
214620	And I have to say personally I agree with that statement Cohen can talk about not being reimbursed 0
217680	But he stayed employed did Donald Trump. He continued to be paid so the money could be seen as still connect 0
222930	It's not like how Donald Trump always says Mexico is gonna pay for the wall the the argument that he has moved to isn't that 0
227370	They're going to just actually 0
228550	Pay for the building based off of business deals the already existing flow of money we can tweak levers so that the money makes sense 0
235560	That's how Mexico pays for the wall so obviously the money could be made up elsewhere 0
239190	Which also creates an argument for seeing Donald Trump's finances? 0
242910	I'd really like to see if Michael Cohen's billable hours went up after this one hundred thirty thousand dollar payout just from his heart to 0
249660	A pornstar for no specific reason and to me. It's just it's surprising that in the midst of the the porter cover-up controversy 0
256140	We're now seeing this 0
257918	It's it's hard to call it anything else other than a cover 0
260370	But with all of that said I do want to pass a question off to you. What is your takeaway from this story? 0
264060	I'd love to know your so let me know in those comments down below 0
266280	We actually have a last second update to this story 0
268380	Oh as I was about to be finished according to the Associated Press? 0

351720	Shared the secret link of the day anything at all links is always there in the description down below then in international news 0
357150	Let's talk about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu the reason for that is yesterday Israeli police that there is enough evidence to bring charges against Netanyahu 0
363810	for corruption according to a statement released by police 0
365880	There is sufficient evidence against the Prime Minister on suspicions for the offence of accepting bribes fraud and breach of trust 0
371250	This statement is huge because it comes after a 14 month investigation 0
374169	Into two separate corruption cases involving the Prime Minister 0
377070	And these investigations are known as case 1000 in case 2008 1000 centers on Netanyahu allegedly accepting two hundred eighty thousand dollars in gifts between 0
384820	2007 and 2016 those from Hollywood producer in Israeli billionaire are non milk Shan and Australian businessman James Packer gifts included items such as champagne 0
392979	cigars jewelry clothing according to police in return for these gifts Netanyahu milchin with political and financial favor favors 0
400009	they say included Netanyahu pushing for a law that would give tax breaks to Israelis returning to Israel after spending time abroad this would have 0
405800	Been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars her milchem Netanyahu helping will Shaun become a shareholder in one of Israel's top television stations when Netanyahu 0
412370	Was Communications Minister? 0
413669	Netanyahu intervening to prevent the collapse of another Israeli TV station amil John had shares and and Yahoo 0
418889	assisting Milch on to get a new 10-year US visa 0
421199	Netanyahu pushing through a business deal involving Milch on an Indian billionaire Ratan Tata even though the Israeli defense ministry opposed it and while Netanyahu 0
427909	Has not denied that he received the gifts 0
429860	He said that there were just merely gifts between friends as far as the other investigation case mm 0
434360	That involves Netanyahu's striking a deal in 2009 with a man named Arne and Moses 0
437960	He's a publisher of one of Israel's largest 0
439710	newspapers and according to police 0
441149	Netanyahu would receive positive press coverage in his paper and then in exchange 0
444649	He would help promote the paper and try to stop the growth of a rival paper specifically one that was distributed for free and owned 0
450050	by billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson 0
452330	They're even secret recordings of 0
453629	conversations between Netanyahu and Moses that were released in January of last year this by Israel's channel 2 in which Netanyahu discusses passing legislation that 0
460550	Would prevent Adelson's newspaper from being freely distributed last week? 0
463310	We also saw the head of Israeli police 0
464849	Insinuating in an interview that Netanyahu had hired private investigators to tail the police this because they've been conducting the corruption 0
470759	investigation and following all this news and reaction to the recommendation Netanyahu made a ten minutes hell of a statement yesterday deny the 0
476999	Accusation saying that he would continue being prime minister saying since I was elected Prime Minister 0
481219	There was hardly a single day in which I was not 0
483180	Subjected to slander and false claims over these years there have been no less than 15 0
486870	Investigations against me with the goal of bringing me down they all began with explosive headlines live 0
490860	broadcasts from the studios and some of them even with noisy police 0
493770	Recommendations to indict just like today all these attempts ended with nothing because I know the truth Excel you these two will end with nothing 0
499550	Which then brings us to the question of what happens next and also potentially an answer to? 0
503819	why why does Netanyahu seem so sure that this will end with nothing now that the police have made their recommendation the 0
509129	Investigation goes to israel's attorney general's office the Attorney General the state prosecutors 0
513049	They'll look over the evidence from the police investigations, and they'll decide whether to indict Netanyahu 0
516979	It's all we're looking at as a situation where even if it does happen that could take months 0
520190	There's also been criticism and people wondering if everything's actually going to be above the board because Israel's Attorney General was Netan 0
526360	whose former cabinet secretary and also was his favorite choice to become Attorney General so obviously there's a connection there a 0
532279	relationship there many wondering if this person can be objective and it will be interesting to see what happens because 0
537410	Israel is in a very interesting place right now if Netanyahu is indicted. He is convicted 0
542200	He could face prison time at the very least does create a public perception 0
545660	problem for Netanyahu even if he is not indicted Israel's other political parties have enough seats in Israel's parliament to call for new elections before 0
552370	The scheduled election so they could potentially take advantage of the situation as it is right now 0
556000	And also let's say Netanyahu was removed this would be a massive change to the region. I mean we're talking about Netanyahu 0
561190	He's been in a position of power since the 1990s. There are a lot of question marks how would this change? 0
566360	Israeli Palestine peace talks 0
568370	Netanyahu has had a very hard line stance how would this affect the extremely? 0
571430	controversial Israeli settlement situation what this affects for the region is far-reaching so that's why this 0
576019	Is going to be one of those situations that it will be important to watch? 0
579100	This is a potential game changer, and so as we find out more as the situation develops 0
582430	I'll keep you in the loop 0
583540	Then I want to talk about some really interesting and controversial news coming out of the Netherlands and the reason for that is the Netherlands 0
588370	Has now officially passed a new law that automatically signs everyone up to be an organ donor they're also not alone in this move there 0
594010	They're following the footsteps of countries like Spain France Belgium. They have similar program now 0
598089	That said while the program does exist somewhere else it is still highly debate off with your everyday people and in the government in fact 0
603550	The upper house of representatives only passes by a vote of 75 to 74 0
607300	Then had to go to a lower house because it needed some amendments before it passed 0
610120	But even there it narrowly passed in a vote of 38 to 36 and so with this law passing means then 0
614810	2020 the act of donor registration changes the organ donation system from opt-in to 0
618980	Opt-out us most of the world you have to opt-in you have to say yes 0
622300	I'm fine if I die you can take my organs 0
624399	But in the Netherlands that will no longer be the case they say people 18 and over who aren't registered already will receive a letter 0
629260	Asking them if they want to be a donor. They have the options of yes 0
631930	No, my next of kin will decide the designated person will decide the person doesn't respond to that one 0
636940	They will get a second letter six weeks later, and if again. There is no response 0
640329	They will automatically be signed up to donate their organs. You can still opt out of the program 0
643959	You just you just have to take the steps yourself to do in response to this change the Dutch kidney 0
648199	Foundation's called the vote a real breakthrough for patients on waiting lists their founder Tom møøse 0
652190	traumatic hundreds of patients will get back their lives and freedom 0
654850	But I mentioned this story not to say whether it is right or wrong because I'm fascinated know what you think about this 0
660290	I'm still trying to digest the situation as someone whose father was saved by a transplant 0
665930	I kind of loved the idea of there being more 0
668130	Organ donation although my father got a kidney from someone that was alive so that today 0
671360	There's not a perfect connect to there 0
672860	I think that as long as the Netherlands does a good job of educating the public of this change 0
676910	Which it should be plastered everywhere? I think it'd be a great move that saves lives, but then I also start wondering well 0
682010	What do they do if they have a hard time identifying someone like what happens if you die? 0
685550	But you don't have your wallet on you like I said still trying to digest it 0
688430	And that's why I would love to know your thoughts on this man 0
690410	Let's talk about the potentially devastating news for 0
692610	YouTube Facebook and the creators on their platform in the past we talked about various iterations of the YouTube ad pocalypse 0
698850	Something happens on the platform a lot of advertisers freak out they pull their advertising for the time being right now Google 0
704370	YouTube Facebook hell any any social media platform that is that any controversy 0
708990	Whatsoever is looking at the bad end of a gun held by Unilever? 0
711740	And if you don't know Unilever is one of the biggest consumer goods companies in the world they own brands like dove 0
716700	Lipton Axe Ben and Jerry's even more important 0
719570	They had an annual global advertising budget of 9.5 0
722450	Billion dollars last year 25% of their ads were digital there were the second biggest global advertiser in the world in 0
727890	2017 and the reason we're talking about them this week is their chief marketing officer Keith weeds said they are prepared to remove their 0
733620	Advertises threat made in response the allegations that these online 0
736320	Platforms are still not doing enough to police extremists and toxic content now keep in mind in his speech 0
740990	He does not specifically name Facebook and Google 0
743510	But it's what he's talking about saying fake news racism sexism terrorist spreading messages of hate 0
748800	toxic content directed at children parts of the internet we have ended up with as a million miles from where we thought it would take 0
753980	Us as one of the largest advertisers in the world we cannot have an environment where our consumers 0
757670	Don't trust what they see online it is critical our brands remain 0
760370	Not only in a safe environment 0
761610	but a suitable Unilever will not invest in platforms or 0
764610	Environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society and promote anger or hate consumers care about fraudulent 0
770250	Practice fake news and Russians influencing the US election they don't care about good value for advertisers 0
774950	But they do care when they see their brands being placed next to ads funding terror or exploiting children 0
779300	We'd also saying that he has already begun discussions with Facebook Google Twitter 0
782850	Amazon and snapchat about policing their content better now in response to this facebook said they support weeds common Google saying weeds always push us 0
790040	To be better. This is then we take serious and also what I looked at youtube 0
793050	I think it's it's these kind of threats that are the reason why YouTube is finally policing people like a Logan poll 0
798090	It's not just that the actions of a very very large creator on the platform hurts all the little guys it hurts YouTube itself 0
803550	right with a website as big as YouTube you can say you know you know that there's so much content the bad contents at the 0
808470	Side when it's one of your staples that is at the center of a controversy 0
811750	it becomes a different conversation this actually ties into a story people have been wanting me to chime in on and that was specifically the 0
817170	CEO of YouTube Susan Wojcicki, if she had an interview may have already seen one of the headlines CEO of YouTube defends 0
822690	Logan Paul a great description of the situation 0
825130	YouTube CEO says Logan Paul doesn't deserve to be kicked off the platform, and I personally believe describes a situation better 0
831030	And there was a lot of outrage around this report because a lot of people saw this as YouTube defending, Logan Paul 0
835170	You actually go through the full interview 0
836250	Which I did what? 0
837360	She's saying does make sense 0
838710	YouTube is currently punishing logan paul by removing him from google prefer removing his ads in general and susan points out 0
843630	It is incredibly important for them as a company to to look at something and go okay. That's distasteful 0
847920	That's maybe not advertiser friendly did it break guidelines 0
850770	Or enough guidelines the three-strike policy that we have as creators on youtube to remove that person from the site and on that no they 0
856440	Are saying they are trying to kind of police that grey area or something maybe distasteful off-putting 0
860760	But doesn't necessarily qualify for each right so with logan paul 0
863550	You know the suicide exploitation scandal strike some of the other things that people have gotten angry about not so much 0
869130	But that's where the removal of ads removing people from recomended 0
872460	That's where that could go into place the thing is we need to codify 0
875710	What we see as distasteful as in our policies, and then we need to have that be very clear for so with it 0
882600	We're not just saying oh look 0
883800	This is distasteful and kicking it off of the platform, and then I think the other thing we need to do is 0
889900	Consult also with experts too, so we're starting to do a lot more of understanding 0
894340	You know sort of where do we draw these lines my personal mindset as I've said from the beginning has not been that Logan Paul 0
899520	Should be removed from the website for YouTube to change their system 0
903060	Which as of right now still even even if you remove the advertisements still incentivizes people to do outrageous 0
909640	Outlandish things and they've taken those steps at least partially you've seen them actually suspend advertising 0
914820	They've they've also threatened to remove people from recomended, but with Logan Paul 0
918750	We haven't seen them actually implement that we'll have to wait and see what happens 0
922000	To several people who prowl who probably wouldn't want to be named from YouTube and and there are varying opinions 0
928400	About Logan Paul and his his treatment thus far 0
932020	That's at all of it brings us back to the Unilever situation which will be very interesting to watch out of all the ad pocalypse 0
937130	Situations. We've actually never seen Unilever back out 0
939760	That said you still have brands like AT&amp;T who have pulled their advertising still not coming back to play with you, too 0
944890	But that said we'll have to wait and see that's where I'm going to end today's show remember if you like this video you like 0
