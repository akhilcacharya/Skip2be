176009	The only way that I would be 0

178045	being Nassar's 0

181214	And actually, 0

182549	it's being reported Randall was 0

298147	And according to Emily, 0

299621	"had a really long talk 0

300921	"They sent me back to class, 0

302869	"again fifth block, 0

304304	"they told me about 0

331264	For the most part it just 0

333266	bullying sucks, 0

335035	This is a serious issue. 0
336169	Now in response to this, 0

338238	Scott Walter said he couldn't 0

340540	to her privacy rights as 0

342742	"In talking with Emily, because 0

344845	"we talked about what she was 0

359593	she recorded the video after 0

361828	permission of two teachers. 0
363063	Specifically she mentions two 0

365565	them is the one who has his 0

367901	Now, of course because the 0

369869	especially someone in a position 0

372939	down just because 0

374741	this story blows up. 0
375942	Gets hundreds and hundreds of 0

378615	not have gotten if 0

380981	In general, most of the reaction 0

383673	and very negative 0

385285	But also according 0

386686	the school has also received 0

389089	He's said they've received 0

391591	students who say they 0

393560	One including a gift from 0

422289	to please do a better job. 0
423537	You may feel 0

425225	but at least one person 0

427327	Also, just because one person 0

429829	the back doesn't 0

431197	Also, to the parents 0

433366	how my child talks about school. 0
434968	One, a ton of children don't 0

437570	They also have 0

439245	And two, none of what 0

441675	understandable that you gave 0
443022	this student two days 0

445297	that you punished this person 0

448160	And you're like, 0

449452	"it was on school property." 0
451685	Maybe you should do a 0

453286	a lot more listening. 0
454187	I think maybe that would be a 0

456890	who is helping and 0

459359	Or not, it's the 0

461394	Then, in a quickie 0

462762	I like to call "Is It Weird?" 0
466032	Let's talk about 0

468287	The reason for that is this 0

470437	March 2018 dual cover featuring 0

473606	And more specifically, 0

475366	was a photo of 0

477179	with their&nbsp;legs wrapped 0

478745	That photo got 0

479763	Some people loved it, 0

482015	others thought it was 0

484751	And so I pass the 0

486086	is it weird? 0
486820	As far as my opinion, 0

489189	bothered more by the amount 0

492505	and two, I don't 0

494561	Like my experience with 0

498865	are my two little boys. 0
500266	Right, so I'm like okay, 0

501935	they're gonna be 0

503737	You know, one's gonna be four, 0

505505	Also, what is up with that pose? 0
507173	What is supposed 0

508708	We got a hand on a foot, 0

510777	It kinda just looks like they're 0

512779	I'll pass the 0

514114	I'm done with this story. 0
514780	The more we stay on 0

516783	And then let's talk 0

518518	legal news out of California. 0
519986	And this all revolves 0

522188	Prop 64 is the voter approved 0

524657	January that legalized 0

527083	anyone 21 years or 0

529229	So most people know or 0

530797	But a big thing is it also 0

533400	marijuana convictions to 0

535568	cases dismissed or recalled. 0
536870	The only potential issue with 0

538972	costly and time consuming. 0
540206	So that's California in general 0

542342	San Francisco District Attorney 0

545045	office will be retroactively and 0

548815	This meeting that in 0

551017	misdemeanor marijuana 0

553887	will be dismissed and sealed. 0
555152	Also another 4,940 felony 0

557960	will be reviewed, 0

559705	That said, there are 0

561795	Individuals who 0

563496	have committed a violent felony, 0

566299	they've sold marijuana to 0

568234	age of 21, those people 0

570603	their conviction revisited. 0
571571	It just happens, 0

573206	to petition the court, 0

575041	it just happens. 0
575875	And as far as why the 0

577911	in a press conference 0

579599	"While drug policy on 0

581481	"backwards, San Francisco is 0

583817	"undo the damage that this 0

599766	"housing and other benefits 0

601935	"community to take action, 0
603269	"we're taking action 0

604904	And I mentioned the 0

606239	one, Gascón is 0

608575	and I hope other 0

610310	And two, to let people 0

612112	this part of Prop 64. 0
613646	According to the 0

615482	only 4,885 people across the 0

619118	the court to have 0

620753	This despite the 0

622722	we've seen in California. 0
623770	I mean just 0

626192	there were nearly 0

628394	related arrests in California. 0
629829	So there you go, now you know. 0
630897	Maybe you can do 0

633032	not only do I hope the rest 0

636402	right, just handle 0

638471	so they can live their lives. 0
639405	But hopefully more states 0

641307	because it is insane to 0

643309	nonviolent drug 0

645044	something with marijuana, 0
646416	and it can ruin 0

648348	But that's where 0

649096	Then we had a quick update on 0

651851	That, of course, the horrifying 0

654621	Morgan Geyser stabbing another 0

658658	That girl managed to survive, 0

661294	they were charged. 0
661995	The reason it's called the 0

663796	two girls said they did this 0

666766	so they could be in his favor. 0
667867	They could live in his mansion. 0
669102	The last update we had 0

671271	to 25 years in 0

673206	And the new update today is that 0

675842	to 40 years in 0

677947	That said, will she 0

680013	With how severe they described 0

683483	But according 0

684984	"She can petition to 0

687053	"and I presume we'll do that." 0
688254	This is where we 0

689622	And then let's talk about 0

691858	Baltimore Police Department. 0
693326	An elite gun trace task 0

695728	indicted in 2017 and is 0

698331	And over the 0

699476	details have emerged exposing 0
700967	over four years of 0

703496	This task force was supposed 0

705972	something Baltimore has 0

708274	But instead this group 0

710777	arresting without warrants, 0

713379	abusing overtime, selling drugs 0

717220	getting them back 0

718952	But they were finally caught 0

721220	internal affairs and the use 0

723590	And so these 0

725058	And all of them pled guilty 0
726192	except for Daniel Hersl 0

728428	And over the past week, 0

730464	detailing years of abuses, 0

733399	Things like nearly every 0

735168	doubled because 0

736869	So instead of the 0

739238	they'd essentially double it. 0
740206	They've stolen hundreds 0

741874	over the years. 0
742542	They're also facing 0

743977	and face decades in prison. 0
745311	Also some of the 0

746846	that have come out are crazy. 0
748281	Reportedly the task force 0

750443	drive fast at groups of people, 0

753475	see who ran and whoever ran 0
754733	they would just chase down 0

757100	And according to testimony this 0

759626	slow night and 0

761561	There's another story 0

763363	arrested a man by the 0

765298	They took his house keys. 0
766222	They then got his address 0

768525	went to the house 0

770737	broke in, found 0

773106	They crack open the safe that 0
774670	reportedly has 0

776816	They end up taking $100,000, and 0

780346	some expensive watches as well. 0
781554	They then seal it back up 0

784684	themselves opening 0

786452	There's footage of 0

788121	"Nobody touch anything." 0
789055	Then after that incident they 0

792242	with his wife while in jail, 0

795028	legal defense, and the police 0

796796	picture so they went to his 0

799032	door claiming to be another 0

801601	Detective Ward, who pled guilty, 0

804203	source in internal affairs 0

806005	he was being investigated. 0
807050	Officer Rayam testified they 0

809639	half of marijuana and a gun 0

812211	Jenkins told them 0

813680	so they sold it 0

815315	Rayam admitted to stealing 0

818184	He also recounted that in 0

820853	It was widely believed to be an 0

823523	it was actually 0

824924	heavily involved 0

826392	There was a bail 0

827960	with Sergeant Jenkins 0

829862	Reportedly Jenkins would bring 0

832565	So much so that the bondsman 0

835068	$1 million selling 0

837136	between $250,000- 0

839906	Also when stopping 0

841674	Jenkins would pretend to be a 0

844377	drugs and weapons but then he'd 0

846619	weren't his target and then 0

849115	They would also, I know 0

851454	but it just has to be told. 0
853386	They would also reportedly take 0

856122	their vehicles 0

857590	Now there, 0

858725	it's unclear whether they 0

860960	the officers when arrested 0
862228	did have fake guns 0

864030	And they're not even done yet. 0
865732	Holy hell, I mean with the 0

868017	of Baltimore, I mean 0

870770	for not feeling safe. 0
872071	And the last thing I want to do 0

874941	all Baltimore PD as these guys. 0
877543	When you see this is able to 0

881080	untested, I mean how can those 0
882231	people really be 0

884016	And the overtime situation is 0
885048	actually bigger 0

887120	Right now Baltimore PD spends 0
888521	about $1 million per 0

891114	It's gotten so bad that there 0

893960	planning on making their 0

896796	at the beginning and 0

898731	prove they actually did it. 0
899866	With that said, I want to pass 0

902061	really is just an 0

904771	when you see this story, 0

907607	what does this make you feel? 0
908908	Do you think that it's the bad 0

912678	there's a lot more corruption 0
914147	than a lot of people 0
