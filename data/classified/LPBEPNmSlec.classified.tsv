0	Sup you beautiful bastards. Hope even a fantastic Thursday, welcome back to the Philip DeFranco Show, and let's just jump into it? 0
6480	And the first thing I want to talk about today is actually a story about a person I used to include in my thumbnails as clickbait, Kate Upton was in the news. 0
12269	You may have seen on January 31st, Kate Upton alluded to fashion brand Guess' co-founder Paul Marciano assaulting her. 0
17940	She tweeted out, "It's disappointing that such an iconic women's brand Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director, 0
23820	hashtag Me Too." Also posting an image of her tweet on her Instagram with the caption, 0
27840	"He shouldn't be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women, hashtag Me Too." 0
33140	Now Upton didn't immediately elaborate on what happened but 0
35400	her statement had an immediate effect on the fashion brand. Within hours of her initial tweet, Guess' shares dropped by more than 17 percent. 0
41600	Now, obviously keep in mind this happened during that dip in the stock market, but 17 percent is a whole lot more than 4 percent. 0
47940	Marciano has responded to Upton's post, giving TMZ a one-page statement 0
51660	Saying he never touched up dinner was alone with her 0
53699	And that he has built a brand with a quote "long, and proud history of empowering women", also noting Upton's timing her, 0
59069	saying, "She leveled this malicious and false accusation only hours before a gala event at our headquarters in Los Angeles unveiling a new guest campaign." 0
65420	Also, saying he felt Upton statements provided no facts, no details, no dates, and no circumstances to corroborate her allegations. 0
71300	So then yesterday Upton provides details, dates, circumstances, and witnesses in a Time article 0
76340	Upton says that on the first day of her lingerie issue with Guess, Marciano forcibly grabbed her breasts. 0
80940	He kissed her against her will, he grabbed her thighs and arms to pull closer so he could smell her. 0
85240	He also allegedly told photographer Yu Tsai to leave the room so he could, be alone with Upton. Tsai has also corroborated Upton's story. 0
91360	Following that, she said, "Then Paul insisted that he walk me up to my hotel room. I immediately declined." 0
96020	"The only thing I was thinking is 'If he touches me like that in public, I can't imagine what he tried to do in private'." 0
100120	"Thankfully, Yu Tsai stepped in and insisted he do it." 0
102600	"I was so relieved and I felt like I had barely escaped." 0
104680	And following all of this, Kate said the harassment assault made her reconsider her career saying, 0
108220	"It took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth. I wanted to quit modeling. I constantly blamed myself after it happened. 0
113240	What am i doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that? I wondered if it was how i was presenting myself or what i was wearing. 0
118640	I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size, wearing baggy, clothes, started despising my own body." 0
123600	But then calling on the industry to change, saying, 0
125820	"The culture of complacency and tolerance in our industry needs to stop. 0
128560	People know what is going on and have previously accepted it and we can't always require the victims to be the ones 0
132920	to speak up and tell their story, because the victims only know their one story." 0
136520	And as far as where we are now, before Upton's Time interview, 0
139160	Guess said that they, would launch an investigation if she provided concerns that were determined to have merit. 0
143180	And so most likely what we're about to see is an investigation. 0
145640	Then let's talk about the failing New, York Times. The New York Times, who you may have heard are failing. 0
151180	I don't know if you've heard about this, people are saying it. 0
153080	Well the company came out with an announcement today and it really shows the big shift in news media. 0
158040	The company announced today that in 2017, they brought in 1.7 billion dollars and that's also a big deal for a few reasons: 0
164600	one, as a total that is an eight percent increase from 2016, 0
168080	two, a huge part of this is due to a surge in the number of people subscribing to their digital-only content, 0
173600	and three, thanks to an increase in digital advertising 0
176380	Subscriptions now reportedly account for 60% of their revenue; just in the last quarter 157,000 digital-only subscriptions were added. 0
183980	But also if there's something that kind of brings this story back down to earth let's talk 0
187370	About profit as reportedly operating profit dropped, from fifty six million for the quarter to twenty three million this they 0
193160	Say reportedly due to pension settlement charges and higher operating costs as 0
196819	Well as just on the print side a lot of their numbers drop but really all this story shows 0
200690	Is what most millennials and younger know? 0
202910	And that is the future is digit, also in this current climate people care 0
206510	About news, more than ever i used to joke about in the past but one of the biggest things to come 0
209870	From the trump administration and the election in general is that people care about, new 0
213269	Seven-days-a-week used to die over the weekend and for me the only question is do we get to a point 0
217850	Where print media in general 0
219329	dies out and it goes all digit or will there be 0
221850	Holdouts - there's reading an actual physical copy of a newspaper become a gimmick in the future i don't know 0
227150	But it'll be very interesting to see then let's talk, about this situation with holocaust denier and republican candidate arthur 0
233090	Jones, now before you just take, that headline you start saying see all republicans are nazis, this situations a little complicated 0
238970	yes 0

240660	Insurance agent and holocaust denier are they just really quick that description escalates very quickly like we're talking about arthur 0
246560	Jones, who of course loves bubblegum and is the former leader of the american nazi 0
250760	Party, also that that lasting stories is the former leader of the american nazi 0
254660	Party i don't know, about the bubblegum, but, who doesn't like, bubblegum 0
257180	That said this same guy is running as a republican for this midterm election 0
261298	In illinois some of arthur jones's greatest hits include a section on his web 0
265740	With a flier titled the holocaust racket saying there is no proof such a so-called holocaust ever took place anywhere in europe against 0
272610	The jews millions of dollars are made each, year by the jews telling this tall tale of woe and misfortune? 0
277199	also 0

280030	Heritage and culture and something that is not racist or horrible a quote this flag represents to millions of white americans a symbol of white? 0
286199	Pride and white resistance it is the flag of a, white 0
289150	Counter-revolution, also this month when talking to the chicago, sun-times he gave props to hitler for his economic policies economic policies of hitler 0
297039	brought that nation up for the very bottom and 0
300340	12 years of his rule they went from the age of the biplane to the age of the rocket and then interview, the following 0
305580	day says 0
306120	He doesn't support interracial marriages the 0
308500	integration of schools 0
309430	There's more and more we could include here but you get you get the point so the question for many of course is how 0
314130	The, hell, did this guy, become the republican candidate 0
316289	Well it's because he's running in a district where democrats have a lock on the seat democrats have, won the seat every election since 0
321400	1975 the last time a republican ran, which, was back in 2014 democrat won 64 percent to 35 percent so essentially what happened 0
328380	Is that a republican, was not going to run, and then arthur, jones just said 0
331949	Yeah i'll, do it jones actually tried to do this back in 2016 but the illinois election 0
335430	Board kept jones off the ballot for not collecting enough valid 0
337889	Signatures this after the state republican party brought legal action against joan now 0
341909	This, year the general counsel for the illinois republican party reviewed 0
344639	jones's petition and determined that the signatures were 0
346870	Legitimate and so jones could not be kept off the ballot but it is important to note the republican party is not endorsing 0
351990	This, guy, you! 0
352680	also 0

357849	Gathering, jones stated that he regretted voting for donald trump or in his words 0
366159	And once again the republican party wants nothing to do with him so i just want to cover this story for a few reasons the 0
371099	First is a lot of misinformation saying this guy, is representative republicans general know 0
375370	Publicans have denounced and pointed out he has no real connection to the gop, he's been running for a 0
379229	While he's just looking for any way in which is why - at least from a pr standpoint it might 0
382889	Make, sense for the parties to even even in districts where it looks like 0
385620	They, have zero chance whatsoever just just put up like a pizza 0
388830	Boy, you know just so monster mccade slaw doesn't get voted in as your candidate and you have that attachment 0
393539	And finally three this is just a reminder that there are horrible hateful people out there i know 0
399180	We end up covering a lot of stories where it seems like pc has gone wild and it's ridiculous but, but there are 0
404460	Also, people just just filled with 0
406840	bigotry 0
407340	And it's important to remember that because a? 0
408970	spotlight on the horrible is the best way to disinfect it from that i want to share some stuff i loved today and today in 0

442440	Below the first bit of awesome today is we got a teaser for venom and 0
445870	I'm saying, awesome because i'm excited about the movie or some people angry because you don't actually see 0
451030	Venom come on it's a teaser, let's see the beautiful and fantastic tom hardest enjoy him, while you can 0
456090	Also i would figure that, some people 0
457860	Would be kind of pumped about this kind of teaser trailer because there there's a big criticism that trailers show, too much these 0
462930	Days, or whatever i'm excited and we got this really interesting video from Seeker about squishy batteries explaining how they work 0
469380	Then, we have Life Noggin covering "How long will our monuments last" 0
472080	Then we've got a featurette on Altered Carbon, which is that new Netflix series 0
475040	Which I will say, I'm two episodes in right now, I'm kinda digging it 0
478600	I find it very weird that my favorite character so far is a hotel, but I'm digging it so far 0
483040	Then we've got Rich Brian on an episode of Hot Ones 0
485360	and if you want to see the full versions of everything I just shared, the secret link of the day 0
488340	anything at all, links, as always, are in the description down below 0
491460	Then very quickly let's talk about YouTube and Logan Paul 0
494260	Who you may just be sick of seeing his face, which actually is part of the story 0
498700	So of course after massive controversy, fallout, Logan Paul has done his redemption tour, he's posting videos again 0
504240	But something that happened around that, is when Logan Paul returned a lot of people got a notification 0
508540	saying "Hey! Logan Paul's back!" 0
510420	but the thing that made a lot of people angry is a lot of people who are not subscribed to Logan Paul 0
515380	got that message 0
516520	One of the tweets that blew up around this came from Rachel Monday 0
518539	Who tweeted, "Are you kidding me @YouTube!?" 0
520039	"I'm having a hard time receiving accurate notifications from my actual subscribed channels and this crap pops up!?" 0
524220	"I've never once clicked a video of his... at least try to hid the favoritism..." 0
527420	and then YouTube's official account responds 0
529440	"Our bad! We fixed it so that only Logan subscribers will get it going forward. Apologies for the spam!" 0
533820	So the question becomes "Why did it happen? Was it a bug or was it a setting?" 0
537240	and the reason I say setting is part of this seems to be a built in system 0
540700	YouTube's quick response of Oh, fixed it! it was just supposed to go to these people, that makes me think setting 0
545199	because Youtube's a massive website, whenever they have to do a fix it is a massive undertaking, in fact they were saying that 0
550410	Was supposed to target a specific group of people that subscribe to logan paul if they have that ability to push through recommendations 0
555879	like that 0
556649	Did they maybe accidentally do it to everyone that had tags for logan paul idea being that if this system exists in this way 0
562350	And they were trying to help logan paul that the algorithm, would just go 0
565589	Oh, this person watched a bunch of logan paul videos not considering that maybe watch the video of like, oh my 0
570269	God i can't believe logan paul did this what a scumbag look, he, was really offensive here based off of a tag push 0
575579	Youtube's like, oh they, love logan paul they're, gonna love his new video something that may not be the biggest 0
578999	Deal if it's just something on your homepage when 0
580799	You're! 0

581649	For it it's a little more aggressive that could potentially explain it or it may have been a bug 0
585329	And the tags might be where there's a lot of overlap because not only does logan paul use his 0
588629	Own tags in any video that was even remotely talking about this incident they, use many of the same tag but 0
593129	No, matter the explanation i understand why, people are frustrated especially when youtubers have 0
596639	To, deal with other issues then there is a subject of youtube favoritism and really we're only, gonna be able to tell based 0
600779	Off of their actions moving forward obviously it's hard for many to not see this recommended move as a 0
604929	Coordinated effort between paul and ut there have, also been murmurs in the community that logan paul's project 0
609689	that 0

615360	Of other youtubers, who, have had scandals in the past like with a lot of the stories 0
618179	We have to wait and see it's one thing to say, something it's a 0
621360	Whole other to do it then let's talk about to new 0
623369	York, lawmakers taking on the biggest problem in this country right now russia 0
627809	Wait actually i misread that i meant tide pods all the world's so stupid so if you don't know 0
633509	About this stupid there was a meme called the tide pot challenge it wasn't really a thing people joked about eating tide pods and then 0
639809	A bunch of really stupid, people are like, oh i guess i'll 0
642029	Do that because of use more and more children have seen it there have been instances there have been more calls to poison control 0
647470	Centers apparently, became such a, big issue tide, had to release a commercial with rob gronkowski, and they were like 0
652869	Don't eat it pretty simple people joked, about drinking bleach for a very long time usually not that big of a 0
658199	Deal but unfortunately there's just too much stupid in this world and so this has continued to be an, issue that's, why, this week 0
664139	We saw new? York assemblywoman arabella's simha tossin state senator, brad hoylman proposed a bill calling for stronger safety regulation for liquid detergent 0
670949	Packets the two, also sending a letter to tied? 0
672629	Owner procter and gamble asking them to remove their products from stores and implement changes, along the lines of their bill writing 0
678119	We carry legislation to prevent poisonings and injuries by acquiring 0
681119	Child resistant packaging an individual wrapping for each detergent pod stating warning 0
685539	Harmful if put in mouth or swallowed a irritant keep out of reach of children adding our legislation 0
690389	Also, aims to make pods less visually appealing to children teens and adults with, dementia 0
694569	By requiring manufacturers to change the design of laundry detergent packets to a uniform color 0
699179	Also calling for them to use a stronger bittering agent to prevent ingestion reduce their pleasant smell 0
704220	And make them feel more firm 0
705850	Closing it's time that you recognize the danger to those least able to protect themselves from a poisonous product 0
710879	package 0
711239	Like candy if not these products should be removed from store shelves as soon as possible in response to all of this procter &amp; gamble 0
717059	Issued a statement saying there is nothing new in these legislative proposals ya'll said, they already, make the packaging 0
721739	Child resistant if they found from a review 0
723419	Of data from the poison control center that color does not play a critical role in the child's 0
727149	Accidental exposure to laundry pack as for individual wrapping the company says it believes doing so it'd not be helpful in reducing 0
733029	Incidents and may have unintended consequences and closing finally consumers have a choice those, who prefer a single colored pack 0
739079	And use tide free and gentle 0
740459	which is all white is also available in a liquid and powder product for in my response this is i 0
745059	Find the pushing for this legislation to be so incredibly stupid and not needed they've somehow. Tried to make tide pods 0
752649	themselves the villain here it's in childproof packaging 0
755019	That has warnings on it though the most we've seen of people actually chewing on these things are from people 0
760720	Desperate for view and if you actually watch those videos this 0
763149	Mouth-breathers have to really go at it to open up the tide pod when it explodes the bittering agent seems good enough or they're like 0
769169	oh 0

773199	Impossible to completely stop stupid right like every fourth of july it's pretty much an 0
777309	Understood that it would be a bad thing to put a bottle rocket in your, asshole rocket itself involves fire an explosion 0
783269	There's warning on the packaging and on the individual but it still happens, someone will always try and do it and then 0
789810	Every, july 5th i'm talking, about, some guy, that blew 0
792900	A ball off the majority will be fine but stupid always finds, away 0
796560	Well that's where i'm gonna end that one actually the last thing i do want to talk about today is russia i know 0
800640	That i was joking before but russian meddling i know meddlings kind of this vague words 0
804270	Some people just attribute it to just manipulating vote but 0
807089	Overall it's been used in reference to that hacking parties and releasing data just public perception in general a la 0
812880	Fake news and bots a lot of those forms of meddling have been confirmed 0
815910	by 0

816670	Intelligence agencies voter registration rolls were accessed dnc server is where access the thousands of fake accounts 0
822779	And bots pushing so much fake, news out there that have connections to russia, that said, those same intelligence agencies 0
829230	Also, say that no votes were manipulated so the voting in the election, was the voting in the election i feel like 0
833910	That's one of the places there's a disconnect with, some people that when they hear meddling 0
837120	They, think just pure vote manipulation it could involve that in the future but it's so much more now 0
841320	A big part of why this is a story of course is the 2016 election but we're moving forward to the 2018 0
845710	Midterms and this still looks like it's going to be a 0
847529	Big big issue a little more than a week ago ahead of the cia 0
850410	Mike pompeo warned that the russians will try to meddle again, when asked 0
853920	by 0

859020	Do that but, also adding but i am confident that america will be able to have a free and fair election that will 0
863790	push 0

868980	W. Bush speak out on russian meddling 0
877170	another question remind you however yeah 0
881230	During the cold war they, did the same thing now to that i would say 0
884250	Yes it is it is good to hear from a former president, someone that's been in that position saying yes they medal what 0
890050	George w. Bush probably, not the the best messenger not a 0
893940	Guy, that i would normally connect with words like truth and accurate, also side note the george w bush 0
899230	Rehabilitation thing that's been going on so strange to me i know 0
901980	People that years ago were saying george w bush is a war criminal and now. They're, like, see he's speaking the truth good 0
908680	Oh, sweet baby jesus but 0
910320	A voice that could speak on the matter in a better manner rex tillerson our secretary of state who 0
915930	Was in bogota yesterday said i don't know 0
917730	That i would say, we are better prepared because the russians will adapt as 0
920670	Well the point is if it's their intention to interfere they are, going to find ways to do that, we can, take steps 0
924870	We can, take but this 0
925949	Is something that once they decide they're going to do it it's very difficult to preempt it i think it's important 0
930209	We just continue to say russia look, you think, we don't see, what you're doing 0
933389	We do see it and you need to stop if you don't you're, going to just continue to invite consequences for yourself 0
938190	Well i will say it's great that our secretary of state is saying it also appears there's a disconnect between him 0
942990	And trump whether it is tweet it's a seemingly mainly focus on collusion, which that's not what i'm talking 0
946829	About here when i'm saying russian, medal or the trump administration, not really following through on the sanctions involving russia, we talked 0
953010	About this on a previous show, but they essentially argued 0
954899	We don't need to implement the sanctions because the the sanctions themselves 0
958149	Deter people if there's really, no follow-through we're getting a lot of bark from rex, tillerson 0
962410	But he has no teeth ultimately we're gonna have to wait and see and that's actually 0
965880	Where i'm gonna end today of course this is the philip defranco show 0
968370	I give you the news sometimes my opinion 0
970170	And then i want to hear from you and those comments down below remember if you, like, this video you like 0
