16015	And the first thing 0

17417	one of the most requested 0

19987	is the craziness around 0

22164	Special Counsel Robert Mueller. 0
23677	A report came out from the 0

25626	President Trump ordered 0

28528	But then reportedly, 0

30197	backing down after 0

32098	Don McGahn threatened to resign. 0
33834	This information reportedly 0

36069	If this is true, 0

38328	And just so we kind of 0

39933	Donald Trump 0

41742	Deputy Attorney General 0

44244	Special Counsel on May 17th and 0

47481	orders the firing of Mueller. 0

55322	investigating Trump for 0

57691	According to this report, White 0

70270	Deputy Attorney General, 0

72439	and elevating the 0

74107	official Rachel Brand 0

76310	Now the question for many 0

78745	okay, is it true 0

81114	Well according to 0

82916	this was just the New York 0

85252	Clearly dismissing the 0

87688	- At this hour The New York 0

90691	They have a story that Trump 0

124257	- Okay, so it's not fake news. 0
125559	It appears The New York 0

127627	So essentially, he changed his 0

133900	He just wanted to fire the 0

135836	allegations of the Russians, 0

139239	the Trump administration, 0
140507	Donald Trump 0

142275	What's the big deal? 0
143040	Now based off of this I know 0

145379	bash Hannity but in Hannity's 0

148348	been wrong as have all outlets 0

151385	going out there every night and 0

154421	even though Donald Trump's 0

157624	How does he even 0

159459	And I'm talking about 0

161545	I don't care if you're a 0

163930	If you watched this 0

165298	you know that is the case. 0
166504	I've gone after Democrats, 0

168435	everyone in-between. 0
169506	I don't care if you want 0

171479	the President, 0

173640	What we need to see from 0

175642	not going to most likely 0

177644	necessarily profitable 0

179419	stop leaning into their bias. 0
181048	There is no such thing as an 0

183683	separate and I say that 0

185886	as far as that's concerned. 0
186787	I try my damnedest but how 0

189856	accomplish is 0

191291	is it has been an active effort. 0
192626	And I say this not 0

194694	CNN, whoever is going to change 0

197097	of like-minded people. 0
198265	Now here's the thing, 0

201447	Sean Hannity's 0

204471	This morning when 0

205806	asked about this, 0

207741	- [Reporter] Mr. President, did 0

211211	- Fake news, folks. 0

213726	Typical New York 0

215916	- And that's where 0

217284	We have left and 0

219753	their sources said 0

221251	Donald Trump saying, no, fake 0

223677	see if more 0

225459	But all that said, I do want 0

227164	What is your 0

228592	Also, what's your opinion on if 0

231625	I'd love to know what you think, 0

234167	to share, kind of where 0
235184	you land as far 0

237204	We've got Beautiful Bastards 0

238772	so I just love getting 0

240373	And then let's talk about fake 0

243777	the reason that we even 0

247114	Facebook. 0

248801	Facebook didn't invent fake news 0

251985	about fake news so much was 0

254354	articles being 0

255722	The President started saying it 0

258257	and then everyone just said it. 0
259526	It just stuck and everyone 0

261293	they don't agree with. 0
261995	But in the past week Facebook 0

263997	they are going to be fighting 0

266299	Last year they said they focus 0

268335	this year they have 0

269669	a focus on trustworthy sources. 0
271304	The CEO of Facebook, 0

273206	saying in a statement, "There's 0

275308	"misinformation and 0

277410	"Social media enables people to 0

279980	"ever before and if we 0

282115	"problems, then we 0

283817	"That's why it's important that 0

286119	"news that helps build 0

287921	"The hard question we've 0

289990	"what news sources are 0

291892	"with so much division. 0
292859	"We try to make that 0

294327	"but that's not something 0

295896	"We considered 0

297597	"which would take the decision 0

299466	"likely not solve 0

301368	"Or we could ask you, 0

303270	"and have your 0

304938	"We decided that having 0

307007	"sources are broadly trusted 0

309442	And I will say hearing that 0

312445	really what the cynical part 0

314648	"We have a problem with people 0

318018	"true but is not true. 0
319252	"So we're going to ask everyone 0

322355	But that said, later in the 0

324424	learned how Facebook was going 0

327327	a two question survey. 0
328828	Asking simply, do you recognize 0

331798	Yes or no? 0
332465	How much do you trust 0

334301	Entirely, a lot, somewhat, 0

336136	And the response from many was, 0
337871	"That's it? That's what's 0

339773	And in response to 0

341841	Facebook's News Chief 0

344110	"I understand that 0

345660	"how simple a survey is, 0
346903	"but complicated surveys can 0

350016	"meaningful patterns can 0

352252	Adding, "Trust is 0

354087	"but only applies for publishers 0

356456	"so it doesn't yet 0

358291	"The other important 0

359659	"is this isn't a simple vote. 0
360827	"We are not just valuing more 0

363129	"trust but rather valuing 0

365665	"different types of people 0

368301	And for me it's that last 0

370437	Because all surveys, 0

372372	it's very easy to vote bomb. 0
373740	So if Facebook does actually 0

376243	saying that it depends on a 0

378945	what they normally consume, 0

380847	rising to the top would be news 0

383583	people that watch CNN or people 0

388321	of those audiences both trust. 0
390357	If that actually 0

391992	and it's able to fight off 0

395462	this could be really effective. 0
396463	Theoretically what then ends up 0

398865	be things that are very central. 0
400600	Things that appear very unbiased 0

403670	CNNs and the Fox Newses of 0

406640	Because I don't 0

408008	some people say 0

410210	one side rather than the other. 0
411978	It's just a rumor though, 0

413513	But that said, I want 0

415282	what're your 0

416616	Are they doing too much or no, 0
418118	they're finally doing 0

419653	Is it Facebook's job or should 0

422555	and be news literate. 0
423390	I love know you 0

424758	Then what year is it? 0
426059	Let's talk about the XFL. 0
427460	The former failed football 0

430363	The XFL, if you don't remember, 0

432565	alternative football league. 0
433867	If you ever 0

434951	I highly recommend ESPN's 0

438138	Long story short, 0

439706	there've been rumors 0

441116	it was going to happen, 0
442097	Vince McMahon announced 0

445245	And yesterday he did it in a 0

448248	a song that explained 0

450917	Saying that it's safer and 0

453753	what it's all about. 0
454988	Gaming, fantasy, 0

456723	make a bet, 0

459059	fewer penalties and that 0

461394	explaining the 0

463263	- We intend to start 0

466766	40-man rosters, 0

470270	postseason featuring two 0

473773	a championship game. 0
474674	- He also then makes 0

476710	in regards to the players. 0
478311	- As you know, there is a wealth 0

480847	could draw from but in the XFL 0

485151	is going to be as important 0

488154	- Now of that matters 0

490390	Johnny Manziel, he, of course, 0
491891	for a little bit was the 0

493560	Long story short, he's 0

495762	He tweeted, 0

499696	Johnny was ready and 0

502417	this question and well, yeah. 0
504771	- [Man] Will any invites be 0

508173	Johnny Manziel, Tim Tebow, 0

511778	- Well, I think this, that one 0

515280	quality of the human being 0

518051	important as the quality player, 0

521388	someone who does not have any 0

526292	with 'em and in the 0

529863	you will not play in the XFL. 0
533133	That would probably 0

536141	not all of them. 0
536836	If Tim Tebow wants to play, 0

540807	- So no Johnny, 0

542909	Tebow could probably have it. 0
543877	Also one of the points that 0

546346	it's in the rulebook to stand 0

549249	which it sounds 0

551151	it's going to be in 0

552652	if you're going to play in 0

554354	And I will say when 0

556423	I initially thought well this 0

558792	But if there was ever a time and 0

561161	away at a decent chunk of the 0

564164	competitor in their off-season, 0

566499	part of their strategy, 0

568802	You have differing groups angry 0

571037	many penalties, 0

573206	The NFL potentially has less and 0

576176	more parents are not letting 0

578378	because it seems too dangerous. 0
579712	CTE, of course, a big 0

581989	mind regarding the NFL. 0
583149	Also, based on the press 0

585018	that Vince McMahon is treating 0

588121	where you're gonna have 0

590657	like in the past. 0
591391	Vince and the WWE have also 0

594461	many windows models. 0
595762	Just getting their content out 0

597964	it on any screen possible. 0
599699	So there is a chance here but 0

602135	they change the game. 0
603103	But that said to be 20% of 0

605505	anything sports, what 0

607240	You think it's gonna work? 0

609058	Do you think 0

610543	I'd love know 0

611878	Then, let's just knock out 0

613813	yesterday but is also a story 0

616816	Will Oprah and should Oprah 0

620653	A lot of people asked me why 0

623189	gave that speech at 0

625792	And my answer to that is because 0

628928	For the most part, a lot of 0

630964	prospect of an Oprah presidency 0

634000	"Ugh, Donald Trump is 0

637637	"Why do we have a 0

638972	But then when Oprah or 0

641941	they're like "For president!" 0
643151	And you know who 0

645011	Opera shouldn't run 0

647400	In an interview she just did 0

650250	"I've always felt very secure in 0

652886	"what I could do 0

654354	"And so it's not 0

655822	"I don't have the DNA for it." 0
656826	Adding, "I met with someone the 0

658858	"help me with a campaign. 0

660727	Just kinda think of how bat 0

663730	Every four years, we have this 0

666633	participants, fewer entrants, 0

669969	singing competition on 0

672672	wins, they get the ability 0

676042	They can kill legislation, 0
677376	make far-reaching 0

680146	and the things that not only 0

683483	however many Americans but 0

685818	the 7.6 billion people, 0

689322	Winner of a popularity contest 0

693226	for 60 days without the 0

695428	I mean just think 0

697030	I don't think 0

698398	qualified to be President. 0
699532	It just makes me think it's 0

702035	are still alive right now. 0
703169	And then let's talk about this 0

706139	the US military and pedophiles. 0
708141	This week report came 0

710543	widespread child abuse and 0

713613	And if some of 0

715048	that might be because this 0

717016	2015 article from 0

719052	where they wrote 0

720587	It sparked tons of outrage 0

722889	it detailed the 0

724791	Now the question that some of 0

726793	what is bacha bazi? 0
727927	Well, bacha bazi is this 0

729696	for hundreds of 0

731397	in Central Asian countries. 0
732599	It's really only practiced 0

734901	tribal regions of Pakistan. 0
736235	The practice is 0

737904	within Afghan society. 0
739072	It is widespread, 0

740974	Men aren't even afraid 0

742976	Bacha means boy, bazi means play 0

747180	these boys that are used as 0

749482	Afghan men instead of women. 0
750717	Starting at around 0

752719	the bacha bazi, are picked 0

755722	They prey on 0

757056	security, they promise 0

759125	their food, their housing. 0
760593	They say that when you're no 0

762883	we'll pay for your wedding. 0

765030	These weddings can cost 0

767133	country like Afghanistan. 0
768167	And these boys do this 0

771537	pretty much when 0

773139	And as far as 0

774474	we see instances of boys 0

777343	Others being forced into it, 0

779912	We talk about 12 and 0

782448	there's no consent there. 0
783983	These boys are 0

785518	They're used to sexual 0

787754	It's also believed that this 0

789689	society due to 0

791621	I mean for many centuries 0

793310	separated in Afghan society. 0
794861	To this day, 0

796426	largely segregated at all times. 0
798394	So much so that women 0

799999	in Afghan society. 0
801263	Now that said, the practice did 0

803703	penalty of death but it was 0
804911	because the Taliban 0

807140	It was less about 0

809108	"We'll kill you if you're gay." 0
810386	The law was strongly enforced 0
811641	and the practice needed 0

813560	But then came US forces and 0
815248	the practice came 0

816949	It was still illegal but the 0

819652	And often if it was a powerful 0

821985	the crime, it was 0

823790	But where does the US military 0

826283	Well for years, US soldiers in 0

828497	on widespread child 0

830963	Many reports of American troops 0
832018	having problems 0

833666	commanders over bacha bazi. 0
834837	After the invasion by the US, 0

837680	the practice started up again. 0
838891	US soldiers began getting into 0

841170	that they were 0

842859	One example you might 0

845207	An Afghan commander and 0

847836	bacha bazi chained to 0

850083	And in response to 0

852085	a man I would 0

853419	beat the shit out of 0

855198	was reprimanded over it. 0
856206	Quinn claiming that the military 0

858915	even if it occurred on US bases. 0
860793	"The reason we were here is 0

862884	"things the Taliban 0

864314	"how they were 0

866107	"But we were putting people into 0

868314	"were worse than 0

869799	"that was something 0

871701	The Army even 0

872754	Sergeant First Class 0

874276	Martland brought the story to 0
875177	the American public 0

877082	His actions led to a lawsuit 0

879411	Thanks to him, 0

880793	of the Martland Act. 0
881706	An act that requires all service 0

884121	abuse occurring on US bases. 0
885785	After this story broke in 2015, 0

888534	the Special Inspector General 0
889807	for Afghanistan Reconstruction 0

891924	A report dedicated to 0

894060	cases of child sexual 0

896028	A report which was supposed to 0

898598	redacted version 0

900366	And that report is why we're 0

902935	because it is 0

905738	The report shows that just in 0

908107	2010 to 2016 there were 0

912384	gross human rights 0

914743	And the vast majority of 0

917569	Now, the Martland law wasn't 0

919552	but others did the Leahy Laws. 0
921254	It details if the US knows of 0

924056	occurring by 0

925691	then the US needs to 0

927693	Something the United States 0

929896	knowing about thousands 0

931764	reports by Afghan allies. 0
933232	Possibly even worse the DOD and 0

935935	addressing the issue after 0

939105	Inspector General 0

941007	"The DOD and State 0

969836	Just 75 of at least 5,753 0
