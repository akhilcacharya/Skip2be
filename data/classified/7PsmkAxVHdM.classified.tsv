1050	 Higher education is expensive. But then also very expensive. Mainly here, in the United States of 0
7160	 weapons, fast food and study debt. It has not always been that way. In 1980 the average tuition fee 0
13380	 per year at a four-year private school about $ 3,500. After correction in connection with inflation 0
19909	 is that about $ 10,200. Today, a year in higher education costs $ 32,000 - 0
27359	 three times as much as just 36 years ago. How this comes? That is a complicated one 0
32279	 and controversial question. To understand why higher education has become more expensive, 0
36250	 we must first understand why higher education has always been expensive. The biggest part 0
40320	 your school fees go to salaries. The average national student / faculty ratio is 18: 1, 0
45170	 which means that there is one member of the faculty for 18 students. The average professor 0
49850	 in a private school earns $ 126,981 a year. Divided by 18, that's just $ 7,054, 0
57789	 what does not seem that bad. However, you must realize that there is more than just the 0
61059	 faculty. There are coaches, gardeners, kitchen and facility staff, technicians, 0
65800	 admission committees, marketers, IT staff, security guards and 0
69940	 directors. Added up are these salaries and extras from all these people 0
74440	 an amazing $ 24,000 of the total $ 32,000 in school fees. Salaries are high because, 0
81210	 like in many other branches, follow the rules of supply and demand. The most popular 0
86240	 studies change from time to time because interests change because of changes in culture. The 0
90960	 problem is that you can not magically make new professors. By the time new professors 0
95440	 have finished their 20 year study and have specialized in a field, that study is not 0
98970	 longer popular. So when a study is popular, colleges should compete for it 0
103140	 to get professors and the only thing that matters is money. Money provides more professors, 0
108080	 more professors provide more students and more students provide more money. At the same time 0
112610	 get professors of studies that were popular in the past, job guarantee. That means that 0
116970	 promote academic freedom, professors have the guarantee to keep their jobs 0
121280	 until they retire. Because professors can not be dismissed, there is often a surplus 0
126230	 to professors in studies that are less popular. So, we still have $ 8,000 in tuition 0
132420	 about. Colleges need places to teach and the school infrastructure is unusually expensive. 0
138040	 Lessons usually take place only for 8 to 10 hours a day, 5 days a week and about 40 0
142500	 weeks per year. That means that classrooms are only used 23% of the time. The university must 0
148680	 however, just pay for that space during that other 77% of the time, which costs a lot. 0
154110	 Moreover, colleges like to build beautiful buildings because they attract students. The average 0
158140	 cost to build a building varies by location, but is $ 115 to $ 215 per average 0
164000	 square meter. However, U-Mass Amherst's Commonwealth Honors College cost $ 354 per year 0
169700	 square meters, the U-Mass Boston's General Academic Building 1 cost $ 594 per square meter 0
175760	 and the Berkely's Lower Sproul Building cost $ 659 per square meter. 0
180470	 There are, of course, other factors that contribute to the high price of higher education, but staff 0
184250	 and buildings are the big two. Then now why higher education has become three times as expensive. It is 0
189150	 always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently used buildings, 0
193400	 So what has changed in the last 30 years? Well, higher education is more popular than ever. In 0
198040	 in the past 20 years the number of registrations has increased by 50%. Support from the government 0
203180	 for colleges has also risen to record high since 1980, but with the simultaneous 0
207880	 increase in the number of students, the converted support per student is at a low point. Ohio paid in 1990 0
213819	 flagship of universities - Ohio State University - 25% of their public money budget, 0
219690	 while in 2012 only 7% of their budget was paid by the government. With less government money 0
225640	 students have to pay more out of their own pocket to make up for the difference. Added to this 0
230819	 colleges have adapted to be attractive to the new generation. According to William Strauss and 0
234700	 Neil Howe is the generation of millennials - people born between 1982 and 2004 - characterized 0
240200	 7 properties: they are protected, confident, cooperative, conventional, pressured, 0
245730	 results and they feel special. Millennials are also sometimes called 'trophy children' 0
250120	 and are generally more ambitious and feel more unique than the previous generation, which means 0
253959	 that they believe more in 'the right match' when choosing a study. Colleges responded 0
258259	 to this new attitude by adding more and more facilities to stand out more for 0
262120	 the growing number of students. All these new facilities had to be managed, which contributes 0
266930	 to the explosion in administration at universities. According to the US Department of Education 0
271559	 the number of administrative jobs increased by 60% between 1993 and 2009. That is 10 times 0
277999	 faster than the number of permanent jobs for professors. 0
281270	 Just as I finished my video 'Why Fly So Expensive' with the announcement that 0
284800	 flying is not very expensive, I finish this video with the announcement that higher education also 0
288620	 not that expensive. 85 process of full-time students on four-year programs 0
294590	 receive a financial compensation of about $ 15,500 on average. 0
300300	 That is a considerable amount, but I admit that there is still a large amount left. Until 0
305009	 you consider that higher education is the only major investment you can make 0
308979	 your life, especially today. People who follow higher education earn on average 98% more per hour 0
314249	 than people who only have a high school diploma and that was only 40% 35 0
319089	 year ago. Taking that into account, what is the real price of higher education? When you look at it holistically, 0
324939	 Over your entire life, the costs of higher education are not $ 32,000 per year or $ 128,000 0
330979	 for four years, but minus $ 500,000. By crossing the possibility to go to a college, 0
338169	 you lose on average half a million dollars in potential income. Follow higher education, 0
343430	 children. Thanks for looking! I'm very happy 0
346969	 to tell - for the first time ever - that this video has been sponsored by audible.com. Audible is one 1

357259	 all subscribers of Wendover Productions, I love learning and a good way to learn 1
362099	 is by reading books. The problem is that I have a busy life and hardly have time to 1
366430	 to sit down to read a book. Instead I only read in my planning by listening to books 1
371529	 while driving, washing, running, and so on. Audible has a fantastic selection of 250,000 1
