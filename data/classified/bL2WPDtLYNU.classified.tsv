30	if we find aliens what do we do next 0
4110	when discussing first contact many are 0
6720	quick to point out that historically 0
8370	contact between culturally different 0
10530	civilizations has almost always led to 0
12960	the destruction of one of those 0
14730	civilizations because of this you could 0
17369	argue that we should stick to ourselves 0
19289	leave the aliens alone but in almost 0
21990	every one of those historical examples 0
24180	its the civilization that makes contact 0
26970	that destroys the civilization that 0
29250	receives contact so perhaps we should go 0
31859	on the offensive find the aliens before 0
34320	they find us of course we've been trying 0
36899	for decades to find extraterrestrial 0
38489	life it's one of humanity's great 0
40890	questions are we alone one way we might 0
43530	find aliens is by looking at stars or 0
46079	more specifically the light level of 0
48450	stars as the earth has developed our 0
50610	energy consumption has skyrocketed 0
52320	that's just the consequence of an 0
54449	increasingly technologically advanced 0
56489	world it's suspected that this trend 0
58469	will continue 0
59160	and it's also suspected that with any 0
61170	alien civilization they'll also require 0
63449	more and more energy as they advance 0
65479	eventually any planetary civilization 0
67770	will reach a point where the amount of 0
69900	energy on their planet is not enough to 0
72270	sustain their advancing civilization 0
74060	theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson 0
76250	speculated that when a planetary 0
78180	civilization needs more energy than 0
80040	their planet can provide they'll turn to 0
81960	the Sun stars are the most abundant 0
84420	source of energy in any planetary system 0
86909	so a super advanced civilization could 0
89130	build a series of satellites to orbit 0
91229	around their Sun to collect energy when 0
93659	sunlight travels through space it loses 0
95939	energy until the amount of energy 0
97860	captured by a solar panel near the Sun 0
100020	would be astronomically higher than a 0
102420	solar panel on earth with more energy as 0
104850	civilization could produce more 0
106290	satellites and eventually there would be 0
108000	a swarm of satellites orbiting the Sun 0
110009	Freeman Dyson believes that this is the 0
112380	most logical way that any civilization 0
114600	would harvest the energy they need so if 0
117329	we search for a star with orbiting 0
118979	satellites we might be able to find an 0
121439	alien civilization no telescope is 0
123990	powerful enough to see the individual 0
125610	satellites but we can rather easily 0
127710	observe the light level of stars you see 0
130739	once a faraway civilization building 0
133120	satellites the swarm will start to block 0
135220	our view of their son as the satellites 0
137470	orbit from our perspective it will look 0
139900	like this star is twinkling something 0
142060	completely unnatural so by looking for 0
144730	stars with highly variable light levels 0
146830	we might be able to find an alien 0
148900	civilization harvesting the energy of 0
151150	their Sun kic eight four six two eight 0
154120	five two also known as tabby star is a 0
156940	star in the Cygnus constellation of the 0
159159	Milky Way scientists observe the light 0
161500	level of this star for years and they 0
163540	regularly came across irregularities 0
165609	like this maybe there are comments or a 0
168190	debris field obstructing our view of 0
169930	this star but astronomers have doubted 0
171910	that either of those could dip the light 0
173590	levels by this much this has led some to 0
175900	suggest that an alien civilization has 0
178090	built these orbiting satellites around 0
180099	their Sun but we may never know for 0
181690	certain of course all of this is 0
183909	somewhat speculative and it's unlikely 0
186220	that we'd actually find a so-called 0
188230	Dyson Sphere around a Sun it's more of a 0
190840	thought experiment demonstrating that we 0
192549	could find aliens through looking for 0
194379	their impact on the universe conversely 0
196420	aliens might find us based on our effect 0
199660	on the universe that's why we very 0
201489	purposely sent out messages to our 0
203590	hypothetical cosmic neighbors the 0
206470	pioneer plaques were designed and placed 0
208359	on the to pioneer spacecrafts which were 0
210819	the first to explore the far reaches of 0
212919	the solar system since these two are 0
215019	some of the farthest man-made objects 0
217150	from Earth they were sent with a message 0
218859	in case extraterrestrials come across 0
221440	the probes this is what was sent the 0
224500	pioneer plaque it has a representation 0
226690	of hydrogen the most abundant element in 0
229329	the universe a picture of a man and 0
231340	woman including a raised hand a gesture 0
233590	that most likely wouldn't be understood 0
235180	but shows how our limbs move and the 0
237519	existence of the opposable thumb an 0
239410	image of the Pioneer spacecraft behind 0
241690	the humans so that the extraterrestrials 0
243220	could figure out the rough size of 0
245349	humans the location of the Sun relative 0
247480	to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen 0
250540	spin flip transition frequency as the 0
252489	unit something far too complicated for 0
254680	me to explain and lastly an image of the 0
257168	solar system with the rough trajectory 0
259238	of the Pioneer spacecraft but there are 0
261789	issues with this image we have no idea 0
265150	how 0
265860	aliens gather information humans are a 0
268439	visual species since we have relatively 0
270389	good vision so it's natural for us to 0
272849	convey information through images aliens 0
275580	on the other hand could have poor or no 0
277740	vision and therefore no conception of 0
279930	the idea of transferring information 0
281520	through images or they could interpret 0
284490	the symbols vastly differently 0
286289	perhaps the most frequently criticized 0
288060	aspect of the plaque is the arrow it's 0
290520	believed that the arrow symbol is 0
291870	derived from either the shape of arrows 0
293909	or the human hand pointing or perhaps a 0
296460	combination of both 0
297539	aliens would most likely have neither 0
299340	arrows or hands and therefore no idea 0
302099	what this symbol means they could also 0
304439	make the dangerous assumption that the 0
306419	symbol depicts a weapon launching 0
308370	meaning that the spacecraft was sent to 0
310500	harm them other sets of images have been 0
312689	sent with subsequent space probes but 0
315150	the chance of aliens finding these few 0
317279	tiny objects in the vastness of space is 0
319830	miniscule what's far more likely is that 0
322439	aliens will discover humanity off of 0
324539	something we've been sending out for 0
325919	over a hundred years radio signals while 0
328979	most are too weak to reach faraway 0
330539	galaxies some do travel through space 0
332699	and could be picked up by 0
334199	extraterrestrial civilizations 0
335849	especially more advanced ones with 0
337740	better detection technology than us it's 0
339930	entirely possible that we've already 0
341699	unintentionally sent the signal that 0
343680	will be our first message to an 0
345180	extraterrestrial civilization it's also 0
347610	entirely possible that the first sign we 0
349830	will have of extraterrestrial life is a 0
351810	radio message from another planet the 0
353789	problem is then deciphering it the first 0
356039	step is deciding what the message even 0
358169	is is a binary is a radiation is a 0
360539	natural language what is it we can 0
363000	figure this out in the English language 0
364650	the most common word the accounts for 0
367740	about seven percent of all word 0
369479	occurrences the second most common word 0
371610	e accounts for about 3.5 percent of all 0
374789	words then and is about 2.3 percent and 0
377699	so on and so forth the distribution of 0
380310	words it turns out in all languages 0
382469	follows a logarithmic scale the second 0
385379	most common word occurs about half as 0
387300	frequently as the most common the third 0
389460	1/3 is often the fourth one fourth is 0
391979	often the fifth one fifth is often and 0
394169	so on and so forth this is somehow true 0
396990	for all languages E 0
398750	with no common ancestral language which 0
401270	means that more than likely an alien 0
403670	language will follow the same 0
405290	distribution it's not entirely 0
407120	understood why languages follow this 0
409220	distribution but one possible 0
411080	explanation is that people are lazy it's 0
414050	called a principle of least effort 0
415520	people animals even machines will always 0
418550	pick the path of least resistance the 0
420620	easiest path and in the case of language 0
422660	the meaning that needs to be most 0
424310	frequently conveyed will be attached to 0
426170	the most common word rather than a 0
427880	number of other words since that is 0
429980	easiest that keeps happening down to the 0
432650	least frequent word therefore creating 0
434570	this distribution with an 0
436070	extraterrestrial transmission if we rank 0
438560	the sounds by frequency and it follows 0
440750	this distribution we can believe that 0
442880	it's most likely a language but then we 0
445910	need to try to understand the language 0
447350	for this we need to drop all assumptions 0
450620	there are innate similarities across all 0
453200	human languages mostly related to 0
455090	grammar for example pretty much every 0
457669	language separates description words 0
459830	nouns from action words verbs 0
462700	grammatically there are huge 0
464810	similarities between all languages even 0
467090	ones that develop separately some have 0
469760	suggested that this means that humans 0
471950	have a genetic framework for language 0
473960	perhaps we are hardwired from birth to 0
476900	understand what nouns and verbs and 0
478850	sentences are and learning a language is 0
481070	just the process of filling in and 0
483080	understanding that framework from 0
485150	everything we understand about the 0
486710	communication systems that animals use 0
488720	they do not have a universal grammar 0
491090	like humans we therefore have to assume 0
493610	that an alien language would be 0
495260	fundamentally different than ours we 0
497810	don't know how those structure sentences 0
499700	we don't even know if they'll have 0
501380	sentences the problem is if we just 0
503900	receive a natural language transmission 0
506150	there's really nothing we can do when 0
508430	deciphering ancient languages linguist 0
510650	figure out meaning using context and 0
512870	relations to other languages but with an 0
515330	alien language transmission there is no 0
517490	context and no other similar languages 0
519860	to compare it with all this is assuming 0
522229	that aliens use a verbal language and 0
524150	that's a huge assumption many if not 0
526640	most animals have no verbal 0
528890	communication system 0
530430	fish and chameleons alter their body 0
532200	color to communicate while ants and 0
534060	honeybees use pheromones to talk to 0
535920	other members of their species even if 0
538110	we understood their language could we 0
539970	understand what they're saying take this 0
541860	sentence in French translating it 0
543839	literally word-for-word gets you the 0
546089	palace verb on is the name commonly 0
547860	given to the building that houses the 0
549480	assembly national French located on the 0
551490	Kiev or say in the seventh borough of 0
553320	Paris of the square of the Concorde even 0
555750	if you clean it up to a structure it 0
557130	like an English sentence how much 0
558660	meaning is conveyed to you what exactly 0
561089	is the French National Assembly where is 0
563279	the Chi of or say where is the seventh 0
565500	borough where is Concorde Square someone 0
568380	familiar to Paris and France would 0
569970	understand what these words mean but 0
571830	someone from the other side of the world 0
573180	would infer little meaning from them 0
575240	philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously 0
577890	wrote if a lion could speak we would not 0
580260	be able to understand him language is 0
582779	all based on cultures and requires a 0
585089	common frame of reference if you said 0
587550	I'm taking an uber to get some coffee at 0
589860	Starbucks there's no way it would 0
591779	understand what you're saying you have 0
593459	to explain what uber is then explain 0
595529	what a car is what the internet is what 0
597870	a phone is an app coffee Starbucks 0
599790	stores the monetary system all stuff 0
602190	that is intuitive to modern humans 0
604260	translating the words of an 0
605880	extraterrestrial civilization is just 0
608010	the first step understanding what 0
609750	they're saying is the more difficult 0
611040	task centuries or millennia after 0
613770	detecting aliens we might reach a day 0
615839	when an extraterrestrial being comes to 0
618089	earth if this happens the alien 0
620220	civilization is almost certainly more 0
622380	advanced than humans since it has 0
624180	accomplished interstellar travel and 0
626040	perhaps even faster than light travel 0
627930	but we want to show that us humans are 0
630270	intelligent as well of course the et 0
632580	would see everything that humans have 0
634079	built but they might interpret the 0
635910	structures of mankind as natural 0
638100	phenomenons we can't assume that they 0
640230	think that buildings and cars and 0
642089	artificial light are not part of a 0
643950	natural structure of Earth we therefore 0
646110	need to show them that we have at least 0
647970	a basic understanding of the universe 0
650130	math as far as we know is universal no 0
653250	matter where you go or who you ask 2 0
655620	plus 2 is 4 and the ratio of a circles 0
657779	circumference to diameter is 3.14159 2 0
661560	and so on and so forth 0
663570	of course what you call two or four or 0
665310	PI would be different but the concepts 0
667440	are the same therefore we could show the 0
670260	aliens our understanding of math put 2 0
672660	then 2 &amp; 4 4 &amp; 4 then 8 keep this going 0
677250	until they get the point although 0
678570	perhaps the best mathematical principle 0
680970	to demonstrate would be the Pythagorean 0
682740	theorem it's complicated 0
684480	but easy to show the Pythagorean theorem 0
686970	of course demonstrates that in the case 0
688980	of a right triangle the square of the 0
691050	side opposite to the right angle is 0
692790	equal to the square of the other two 0
694590	sides combined in an equation that reads 0
697290	a squared plus B squared equals C 0
699270	squared 0
699780	visually we can demonstrate this by 0
701880	drawing squares on the two shorter sides 0
703770	out of smaller squares and show how the 0
705960	amount of squares on the two sides 0
707490	equals the amount of squares on the 0
709200	longer side showing this theorem cements 0
712020	that humans do understand how the 0
713850	mathematical aspect of our universe 0
715860	works even though were less advanced 0
717960	than the aliens so now that we've found 0
720030	the aliens now that we have met them we 0
722760	can talk to them someone needs to speak 0
725310	first but let's say was you let's say 0
727710	you were given the chance to ask the 0
729450	first question from humanity to an 0
731490	extraterrestrial being you became the 0
