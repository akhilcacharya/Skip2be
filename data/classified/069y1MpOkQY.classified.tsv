160	 Two weeks ago I posted a video about why flying is so expensive and it turned out to be popular. 0
6180	 However, they also wanted to know how it is possible that budget airlines are so cheap. 0
12290	 That is a complicated but interesting answer. To keep it simple, and to ... 0
17070	 not to exclude our European friends, we will focus on the European model of budget airlines. 0
22130	 Although there are low-cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia and many other places ... 0
27230	 budget airlines were the first successful in Europe and they are still today. 0
31400	 The extent to which airlines such as Ryanair and 0
35770	 EasyJet to reduce costs in Europe is also more significant than elsewhere in the world. Budget airlines in 0
40910	 the US can be 10 to 20 percent cheaper than their traditional competitors, while in Europe 0
46129	 the price of a budget airline only costs half or even a third of the price of one 0
50840	 normal airline. You can regularly find flights of 2 to 3 hours with budget airlines for less than 0
55989	 ten euro. So, how do they work? Not completely surprising 0
60840	 Budget airlines take every expensive part of the flight and make it cheap. 0
65680	 The most essential thing an airline needs is its planes and it is possible to save on this. 0
69910	 In the months and years after 9/11 the growth of aviation stagnated 0
75120	 most airlines had to fight to survive. Meanwhile, it went well with Ryanair and placed it 0
80660	 a huge order of 151 737's from Boeing for an incredibly low price. 0
88180	 Fortunately such a situation does not occur often, but budget airlines can always place large orders, 0
93380	 what gives them a bulk discount. It may seem strange that a budget airline 0
97640	 buy brand new planes, but the latest planes are the most efficient, saving fuel. 0
103070	 The fuel efficiency of new aircraft outweighs the higher purchase price, so Easyjet (4.0), 0
108930	 JetBlue (4.7), Ryanair (5.0) and Spirit Airlines (5.7) all have a younger fleet than any other major 0
113890	 airline (KLM: 9.4, Air France: 11.5, Lufthansa: 12.4). Budget airlines usually have 0
116590	 just one type of plane. Ryanair only has 737s and uses EasyJet alone 0
122860	 the A320 family. One type of aircraft means pilots, flight attendants, mechanics 0
129149	 and ground staff but need to be trained for one type of aircraft, which is a huge saving 0
133940	 time and costs. Inside the aircraft, budget airlines often avoid unnecessary luxuries 0
139030	 to keep costs low. For example, Ryanair seats can not be changed, because that is the 0
144550	 purchase price would increase and more maintenance would take. The design of the chair 0
149120	 saves the flight attendants time, because there are no bags on the seats that need to be cleaned between 0
154070	 flights through. Stewardesses of budget airlines often stand by 0
157020	 at the beginning of their career and get little training. They obviously get the 0
160940	 necessary safety training, but little training in hospitality. In addition, they often fulfill 0
165920	 multiple functions. When they have landed, some stewardesses will 0
170320	 going to the gate to check tickets while others clean the plane. This saves 0
175400	 the airline has three or four functions that it would otherwise have had to pay for. On board are flight attendants 0
179740	 obviously responsible for eating and drinking, which is almost never free. Service on board 0
184900	 can be a perfect way to earn extra money. Many budget airlines sell duty-free products 0
189690	 and Ryanair even sells lots for a lottery. 0
193140	 Let's talk about airports. You will never get Ryanair to London Heathrow or Paris 0
197910	 Charles de Gaulle see flying because these airports are expensive. There is only a fixed number 0
202640	 flights per day, making supply and demand ensure that 0
206670	 the rate for the landing fee is high and the places are regulated. Instead Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted or Luton 0
213080	 in London, or to Beauvais in Paris, which is also an 80-minute bus ride from Paris, 0
218030	 technically not even in the same region as Paris and has a website that looks like this! 0
222940	 In many cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of the few airlines that 0
229160	 fly from that airport, which offers them a strong negotiating position. Often they will 0
233620	 choose a small regional airport and rename it to another airport in a big city. 0
239240	 They can ask for lower start and landing commissions and if the airport does not cooperate ... 0
244000	 just threaten to leave the airport until the airport gives way. If there is no cheap, 0
249330	 cost-effective airport in the vicinity of a city, budget airlines can also fly to regular airports 0
254030	 during quieter hours, where landing fees and the chance of delays can be lower. 0
258690	 Now let's look at the smallest details. The airlines of budget airlines 0
262450	 are generally non-stop in use. This Ryanair plane, for example, went in one of Brussels 0
269639	 to Copenhagen, from Copenhagen to Brussels, from Brussels to Prague, from Prague to Brussels, from Brussels 0
275380	 to Nîmes, from Nîmes to Brussels, from Brussels to Treviso and finally from Treviso to Brussels. 0
281419	 Budget airlines plan only between 30 and 45 minutes between the landing of a flight and the take-off 0
286419	 the next flight, which often leads to delays and, moreover, has little time to clean the plane. 0
291750	 However, this means that the aircraft always brings in money and passengers do not pay 0
296100	 for the time the aircraft is stationary. Have you ever wondered why Southwest does not have reserved seats 0
301070	 offers? Because the 'who-as-first-comes' system ensures that you almost always 0
306270	 arrive at the gate well in time and set up in a neat line. This costs boarding 0
311840	 less time and the plane is faster in the air. Another principle of budget airlines 0
317460	 is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs, where most or all of them 0
322490	 planes leave from. British Airways has London, Air France has Paris and KLM 0
328100	 Amsterdam. To get to most places with these airlines, you need a connection to one of these 0
332610	 "hubs". Budget airlines, however, try to have many destinations from many locations. 0
338139	 However, this means that many destinations are only visited a few times a week. 0
343449	 The cheapest budget airlines do not even allow connections between flights. 0
347840	 This would increase costs because they would then have to pay ground staff to transfer baggage, 0
352440	 make a more sophisticated ticket system and passengers to book when they are delayed 0
356790	 miss their connection. Speaking of tickets, there is often no way for budget airlines 0
361110	 get tickets from a real person. Ryanair charges 45 pounds 0
366610	 if you forget to print your boarding pass and EasyJet and a number of other companies 0
370460	 the check-in almost completely with machines. This also reduces staff costs. 0
376889	 At airports, budget airlines do not want to use a trunk because they are expensive. 0
382370	 Instead, they use stairs and let passengers walk across the platform or leave them one 0
386660	 take a bus to get to the plane. Budget airlines earn a lot of money if they do well. 0
391370	 EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%) and Wizz Air (10.2%) all have higher profit margins 0
395970	 than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%) and Air France (2.15%). Much of the 0
400130	 traditional airlines have employees who are members of a trade union with salary agreements 0
404930	 that can not be changed, while budget airlines can hire everyone and train in a few months. 0
409410	 It is also difficult for traditional airlines to grow. There must be a lot of demand for each new route 0
414320	 because a large share of their turnover comes from business travelers. 0
419400	 Because budget airlines are more focused on tourists, every destination that Ryanair adds for example 0
424110	 a popular destination, simply because it has become possible to get there 0
429009	 cheap to go. Some traditional airlines in Europe start their own budget airlines 0
434190	 to also make a profit in this way. Air France has established Transavia and Lufthansa started Eurowings. 0
439169	 Both lose a lot of money. What they seem to forget is 0
444250	 that the US has gone through this phase a few decades ago. Delta started Song, 0
448830	 that failed. US Airways started MetroJet, which failed. United started Shuttle, which failed 0
455850	 after which they were declared bankrupt and decided to try again with Ted, which also failed. 0
460030	 None of these has worked! Traditional airlines can not negotiate their employment contracts, 0
462889	 honest business and dedication to their hubs. The reason that Ryanair 0
464169	 and EasyJet succeeded while others failed, especially because they are 0
468530	 be big and flexible. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands 0
474180	 employees and a negotiating position that enables them to exceed their competitors. 0
480090	 In the end, competition is good for us as customers. Even failing budget airlines 0
485400	 reduce the costs of traditional airlines and enable us to fly the world more cheaply. 0
