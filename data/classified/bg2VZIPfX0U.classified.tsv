5460	 There is no clear definition of what makes something a country. What makes a country a country 0
10040	 is that other countries agree that it is a country. 0
12799	 For this reason the counts of the number of countries are running around the world 0
16700	 range from 189 to 196. Each country decides for itself which other countries they recognize as a country. When 100 member states of the UN 0
23550	 suddenly recognizing that your cellar is a country, then it will generally be 0
27099	 accepted that this is so. There are, however, a number of steps 0
31599	 that every future country founder must go through if they want to make a chance 0
35489	 internationally recognized. 0
36520	 The first thing you need to start with is one 0
40160	 land is a piece of land. A possible way to get that is to steal it. Of course this means you 0
44429	 have sufficient weapons to defend your own terrain. It could also become problematic when your 0
48289	 country enters the stage where it is judged by other nations, but this method 0
52649	 has worked before. An easier method is to claim unattended land. However, due to the attendance 0
58719	 from satellite photos and modern cartography, there are virtually no islands or large ones 0
63620	 areas that have not yet been discovered. Nevertheless, there is a small number of places that are not yet controlled 0
68340	 or has been claimed by a recognized government. A well-known and recent example is 0
73380	 an area not claimed by Croatia and Serbia, near the river Danube, the border between 0
78270	 the two countries. This micronation, known as Liberland, is not international 0
83280	 recognized and accused by a number of nations, but it claims to be a valid state 0
88630	 because the piece of land has not been claimed before. The territory is 17 times larger 0
93560	 than the area of ​​the small recognized country, the Vatican. Serbia has admitted than Liberland 0
99079	 did not come to their field, but also dismissed the attempt as frivolous. 0
104380	 Other new nations have had more success in obtaining international recognition. Most of these are 0
108180	 partially recognized nations that have been split off from an already recognized state with support from 0
112140	 the people within the territory. An example of this is South Ossetia, which split off 0
116609	 Georgia in 1990 and is currently recognized by Russia, Nicaraqua, Venezuela and Nauru. 0
123229	 Perhaps the most famous and fiercely contested newly established nation is State of Palestine. 0
128729	 136 nations recognize Palestine and in 2012 it was designated by the United Nations 0
134180	 as an 'observation state without membership'. Another option for unattended land is Antarctica. 0
139630	 A large part of the country, known as Marie Byrdland, has not yet been claimed by a recognized 0
144650	 nation. A problem with this option is the United Nations Antarctic Treaty, 0
149160	 that states that there is' no new claim, or extension of an existing claim, with respect to territorial sovereignty 0
153840	 will be made as long as the treaty is in force '. There are claims that already existed before 0
158590	 the treaty, from 7 different states, but its validity is controversial 0
163850	 because of the treaty. In addition to the problem with the Antarctic Treaty, it would establish a sovereign nation 0
169400	 in Antarctica are difficult because of the next step in the process. 0
172730	 A nation is created to serve its people, 0
175770	 so without people there is no nation. There are always 0
179140	 people in Antarctica, but they do not form a permanent population because 0
183910	 they are mainly there for research or tourism and no one stays longer in Antarctica than one 0
188440	 a few years. Interestingly, there are 11 babies born in Antarctica, but they generally have 0
194190	 the nationality of their parents' country adopted. A permanent population is one of the 0
199340	 first requirements to become a state. A sustainable, independent nation would be almost impossible 0
204270	 in Antarctica. Every settlement would have no real economy and no natural way 0
209470	 to produce food. However, there are rumors that there is oil in Antarctica and if this is the case, one would 0
215460	 sovereign and possibly prosperous nation can be erected in this hostile environment, just like 0
219790	 the United Arab Emirates. Like the dozens of micronation claims in Antarctica, 0
225680	 Liberland lacks a permanent population. The founders are attempting the area 0
230180	 reintroduced have been blocked by both Serbia and Croatia. At this moment it is unlikely 0
235770	 that there will be a permanent population in the near future and for this reason the 0
240120	 future of Liberland uncertain. 0
241910	 A well-formed government is perhaps the most 0
245180	 determining factor that determines the success of your new country. There are many forms 0
250120	 from government, but since you are establishing this country in the 21st century, you will 0
254210	 Probably base the government on John Locke's government principles. Locke's principles 0
259290	 basically say that, in general, everyone has the right to "Life, Health, Freedom, 0
264819	 or Possession '. You may recognize a similarity between this and another famous document. 0
270879	 According to Locke, in a natural society - that is one without government, these rights 0
275560	 not protected because there is no higher power to do this. So in exchange for taking away 0
280310	 some of these rights, for example Freedom when you get in jail or Property when you pay taxes, 0
285169	 the government protects the same rights. Locke also says that the government only works 0
291060	 when there is a common belief in the abstract idea or illusion of a government and that is why 0
295639	 a government can only really exist when one is behind it. This is the reason that 0
300699	 autocratic or absolutist governments rarely work in a modern society. So, with these principles 0
306150	 in the back of your mind, you now need a constitution. Every recognized country in the world 0
311259	 has either a constitution or a similar document. This is not a complicated process, 0
316020	 I will not go into details too much, but in essence everyone has to land a number 0
320419	 laws, principles and entities that together form the land and the constitution is all about it 0
324550	 define and specify it. 0
326080	 This is where you examine all your work critically. 0
329900	 Obtaining international recognition is by far the most difficult step in the process of creating 0
334310	 a country. It may take hundreds of years for new countries to be complete or almost 0
338689	 fully recognized. Chances are that unless you have full support from the people 0
343419	 in your country, a good reason for the creation of your new nation, completely 0
348370	 undisputed terrain and a well-balanced democratic government, you are recognized 0
353289	 by no UN member state. The chance of a new, well-recognized nation outside of Africa 0
358979	 or the Balkans is unlikely. The governments are too well organized and stable outside 0
364120	 these areas. The last step to get undisputed recognition is to be admitted to the United 0
370009	 Nations. Each application is handled by the Security Council - which consists of China, France, 0
375919	 the Russian Federation, the United States of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 0
379860	 United States of America and a varying group of 10 other countries. As 10 of 15 votes before admission 0
385289	 of your country - congratulations - you have just joined the United Nations. By most 0
390120	 you are now seen as a country. Of course, other members of the United Nations can still opt for you 0
395289	 to recognize and there are enough UN member states that are not fully recognized. That is, however 0
399569	 a topic for another time. So success with your new country, thanks for watching and 0
404340	 see you next time. 0
