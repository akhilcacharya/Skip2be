2169	Fantastic Monday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into and the first thing we're gonna talk about today by far 0
8099	one of the most requested stories from over the weekend 0
10230	And that is the massive announcement from YouTube regarding YouTube's changes changes that seem very much inspired from the recent, Logan Paul 0
17410	Controversies if you've watched the show you know the backstory of Logan Paul's suicide 0
21130	Exploitation scandal that was unfollowed by Logan doing pretty much everything we predicted that he would do 0
25660	Beforehand for his Redemption tour donating money fluff piece interview putting out a video where there was there is sympathetic music with a sympathetic 0
32649	Figure also him using his punishment of being removed from the Google preferred ad program as a way to further pushes merchandise 0
38640	oh 0

41440	Immediately just throw himself back into past behavior this horse video back bragging that he gained a million subscribers during a three week break 0
48579	Thing jokes about swallowing Tide Pods on Twitter even though. He then deleted it 0
52020	I'm putting on a video where he was messing with dead animals one of fish the other rats that he tasered 0
57239	I made him the recipient of a lot of outrage including outrage from PETA which I will say from the beginning 0
61890	I often find PETA to be a kind of ridiculous. Hypocritical organization at many times they he'll blow this story up 0
67530	They got a lot of traction and then YouTube respond official YouTube creators Twitter tweeting in response to Logan Paul's recent pattern of behavior 0
73799	We've temporarily suspended ads on his channel 0
75900	And that was soon followed by YouTube blog posts that outlined what they called additional steps writing today. We're outlining additional steps 0
81930	We may take beyond our current strike systems when channels upload videos that result in widespread harm to our community of creators 0
87340	viewers an advertiser also they don't mention Logan Paul by name in the blog post 0
90750	But you'll see it is about him on premium monetization programs promotion and content development partnerships 0
96030	We may remove a channel from Google preferred and also suspend cancel or remove a creators YouTube original real-ass left off there with Logan his 0
102329	His original was suspended despite headlines saying that it was cancelled 0
105810	I haven't heard super super recent talks 0
107430	But inside of the community just a week ago there were people saying that it was barely suspended 0
111750	But then to monetization creator support privileges you may suspend the channels ability to serve ads ability to earn revenue 0
116700	And potentially remove a channel from the YouTube Partner Program 0
118899	including creator support and access to our YouTube spaces and three 0
121950	And this is probably one of the most important ones regarding people like logan video recommendations 0
125700	We may remove a channels eligibility to be recommended on youtube such as appearing on our homepage 0
129610	Trending tab or watch next now the reason this would be huges people like logan paul have actually grown because of controversy 0
135590	Thanks to the YouTube algorithm. Seemingly promoting videos that are shared a lot off site 0
139459	Which is happening because a lot of news websites are covering Logan Paul. They're embedding his video 0
143120	That's why we've seen Logan Paul trending number one on YouTube during 0
146160	controversy when people are angry at him while he's popping up and 0
148800	Recommended why he's popping up and watch net this also appears not to be a step 0
151730	They've taken against Logan Paul because after this was announced 0
154590	Logan Paul did not release a new video instead just just posted an update on usually and once again even people who were not subscribed 0
160519	To Logan Paul got this update on their home feet so it appears 0
163550	They realize that the algorithm really is promoting people that are in the center of controversy 0
168300	But they didn't take this extra step my response to most of this is 0
171780	positive with an asterisk on and the main reason for that asterisk is if YouTube continues being 0
176850	Transparent about their moves YouTube either needs to make public announcements like they did with Logan and I do believe that them 0
183480	Enacting things like this should be outlier situations like a Logan Paul situation and/or - there needs to be an email or something 0
190250	That's in our dashboard that lets us know that we're being affected in this way if YouTube makes a decision like this and the reason 0
196100	For that is YouTube creators have unfortunately been trained by YouTube to not be 0
200040	trusting of YouTube's um creators based on what they say the content they put out feel like they are playing by a different set of 0
205850	rules with YouTube and well 0
206989	I think most people agree that people like Logan Paul need to be kept in check because they do a lot of harm to everyone 0
212329	That is not them we also have to make sure that on the opening of this door other creators 0
215750	Not hurt, which other creators are still hurting from previous changes. Where YouTube is. You know updating algorithm the algorithm is learn 0
222620	I mean while tons of small creators livelihoods are held in the balance while YouTube figures it out 0
227359	That said that is where we are right now regarding the situation. We'll see if there are more updates 0
231079	If there are any more stories that blow 0
232920	Obviously I know a lot of you get excited when we cover stories like this 0
235880	I am I hate it because all it does is make our community look ridiculous 0
240079	Not all of that said I do want to pass the question off to you. What is your takeaway from this situation? 0
244340	Are you happy with this move from YouTube? Do you think that they're gonna somehow mess it up? 0
248750	I'd love to know your general thoughts also connected to this I know a lot of people want me to talk about the Casey Neistat 0
253500	Interview of the CBO of YouTube Robert Kinsel do have feelings on it 0
256850	I do I do have responses on it what I would I would like to say to 0
259320	Robert and anyone else at YouTube if you would be willing to have someone like me 0
263580	Interview you I would be more than happy something I said to KC before he did this interview 0
268080	It's all about the follow-ups when you have an executive whether it be YouTube anywhere else 0
271840	They know the top-level talking points and ultimately if you boil down YouTube's top level talking points, its we take this matter seriously 0
278740	We are working on it, but then you have to follow up. How are you doing it? 0
282510	Have you done it in the past? What did you learn? What hurdles? Do you have what kind of timeline? 0
286770	Are you looking give us any specific about what you're doing or specific situations. We've seen on site. That's where you're getting real answers 0
293130	That's how you really kick the tires and understand 0
294990	I'm not trying to discount what Casey Neistat did here just just YouTube even opening the door in this manner is fantastic 0
300990	It's a Robert or anyone else that's high level at YouTube Casey nice that has also tweeted the same point it was interview with me 0
305940	I'll put the pressure on you, but I think that at the end of the day 0
308320	We'll both learn from each other and hopefully the audience will walk away feeling like there's some answers, but from that 0

404520	I could make in this story. This is this is a monster 0
406800	This is a story about Brian, Roberto Valero the way the story goes if 18 year-old Alyssa Maness ADA 0
411510	She goes to a party on Saturday February 3rd 0
413550	It's at a mobile home park in Washington, and it's there she meets Brian according to Brian, Alyssa 0
417750	Just broken up with her boyfriend, and she went out partying and wanted to hang out with it, Alyssa was there 0
421470	She reportedly snorted a line of crushed percocet pills and then Brian gave her a dab of liquid 0
425800	THC and reportedly within a minute she collapsed and was unconscious now instead of getting help for her Varela allegedly raped her she also took 0
432210	several photos of her partially naked 0
434110	Unconscious and blue-lipped on his bed and texted those pictures to friends in a group chat the text allegedly read, lol 0
439230	I think she Oh deeds still breathing 0
441240	I'm smashing her to pass the time 0
443130	Then the next morning Varela showed his roommate the dead body on his bed and told him what happened his roommate said he told him 0
448740	To call the police when instead virologist went to work at double shift at Dairy Queen band while at Dairy Queen Pharrell reportedly bragged to 0
454890	A co-worker about what happened saying she died having sex with me 0
458340	He also reportedly said that he considered taking her to a hospital 0
460290	But he didn't because he was quote too tired and just went to sleep 0
463560	He then went on to describe how he broke the victims legs to stuff the body in a plastic crate and talked about a plan 0
468780	to bury her that co-worker 0
469800	Then later saw a Facebook post from the victim's mother 0
472240	Looking for her missing daughter as they saw that they went to notify the police early Tuesday February 6 deputies 0
477330	Then arrived over Ella's mobile home two hours later. They arrested him 0
480480	They very quickly located the victim's body in a plastic crate when confronted by authorities where I admitted that Alyssa seemed quote out of it 0
486720	During sex after she died 0
488010	He said that he washed her body to try to remove his DNA from her claim that he went online to research how to get 0
492450	Rid of a dead body also saying that after reading the Facebook post from Alyssa's mother 0
495840	He used her thumb to unlock her phone and update her snapchat tried to make a post to make it look like she had run 0
500460	Away afterward he threw the phone into a construction zone behind the Dairy Queen detectives have now found the phone 0
505440	They're searching through it Briella has been charged with manslaughter 0
508270	homicide by controlled substance and second-degree rape brian is now in jail bail has been set at 0
513250	$500,000 and oh my god. This is a horrifying story 0
516809	I mean I know the word sociopath gets thrown around for anyone these days 0
520409	But this seems like a sociopath also while I'm glad the co-worker went to police 0
523740	What about everyone else in this story friends that he texted and sent pictures his roommate that saw a dead body I mean 0
530880	It's easy to look at Varela and go oh my god 0
532829	This is this is a monster throw this person in the garbage 0
536160	But what about everyone else that enabled or just sat there and let it happen it didn't report to the police 0
540750	I didn't do the right thing two and a half three days past you can say what you want about backing your friends 0
545880	But if your friend is raping a girl that's dying and then bragging about it 0
549810	I think you choose not to be a garbage person and protect this monster you do the right thing then very briefly 0
553649	I want to mention something that surprised me from the current Winter, Olympics, North Korea Kim jong-un sister the North Korean cheerleaders 0
561029	They've received a lot of positive press coverage 0
563880	It's not just the media people on Twitter praising Kim Jong Un's sister for throwing shade at Mike Pence 0
569610	Oh my God look at her resting bitchface went around Mike Pence hashtag saying. No, are you people insane. I don't care 0
575730	What you think about Mike Pence none of that should ever lead to you being like yay, North Korea? 0
580350	This is all a charade. This is all propaganda any of this fool you this is still, North Korea 0
585690	This is the least free country in the world. It's ruled by a regime that starves their citizens. They publicly execute their citizens 0
592560	They enslave their citizens 0
594389	They run gulags there are stories that make the news of a woman who was made to drown her own, baby 0
599880	You see the positive press coverage about the North Korean 0
603040	Cheerleaders all I see there are human hostages that have been trained to be propaganda 0
606810	I'm sure you'd sing and dance in unison too if the government was like we're gonna put your family in a camp if you don't 0
611760	Play ball when I look at Kim Jong Un's sister Kim neo Jung. I don't I don't see someone 0
615660	Oh, just it's just having some sass I see the head of North Korea's propaganda and agitation Department and understand 0
621269	I'm not saying this as if America does not have its own set of problems 0
624639	But just just read any story from any defector from North Korea, and you will understand 0
630269	That's why I'm horrified and angered anytime any media outlet any youtuber 0
633819	Does something that normalizes the the monsters that run that country the most are the massive scandal and outrage against? 0
640060	Oxfam Oxfam if you don't know as an International Confederation of charitable organizations 0
644019	They say their goal is to empower people free people from poverty see them also 0
648190	Respond to emergency situations like after the Haiti earthquake and actually a big part of the scandal is 0
652930	Connected to the response to the Haiti earthquake 0
654819	There's an investigation that uncovered evidence that there was a cover-up by Oxfam when they discovered that their workers were using prostitutes in Haiti after 0
661199	the 2010 earthquake and after an internal investigation 0
664060	The reports of misconduct three men were allowed to resign four were fired for gross misconduct 0
668500	The Times report that said one of the man that was allowed to resign was hey Dias country director Rowland van Howard Miran he admitted 0
673660	to using 0
674000	Prostitutes in the villa the charity rented for him and using charitable funds to pay for them the charity's chief executive at the time Barbara 0
680380	Stockton allowed him to have a quote phased and dignified exit this because firing him could have quote potentially serious 0
686360	Implications for the charity's reputation there are also concerns that some of these prostitutes would have been underage MP 0
691270	Gavin sugar saying in case you're wondering teenage girls in one of the poorest countries in the world 0
695420	Immediately following an earthquake don't buy any measure choose 0
698900	Prostitution one source claimed to have seen footage of one night that was like a full-on 0
702530	Caligula orgy with young prostitutes even wearing 0
704930	Oxfam shirts and when the firings happen Oxfam assured the public that there were over misconduct that had nothing to do with their aid budget 0
710740	Oxfam also said they reported these incidents to the Charity Commission 0
713150	But the Commission said they never received a final report also saying what they did receive did not detail the precise 0
718940	allegations nor did it make any 0
720500	indication of potential sexual crimes involving minors Commission has also said they're asking Oxfam to review what happened and to provide them with assurance that 0
727240	It has learned lessons from past incidents also that they're taking all necessary 0
730310	steps to ensure 0
731060	Risks are minimised following that report and the statement Oxfam said after the investigation in 2011 we carried out a thorough review of the case 0
737800	Which resulted in the creation of our dedicated? 0
739640	safeguarding team a confidential whistleblowing hotline and 0
742340	Safeguarding contact point within countries as part of a package of measures to ensure that we do all we can to protect our staff prevent 0
748240	sexual abuse and misconduct happening in the first place and improve 0
750950	How we handle any allegations also adding, and this is my favorite part our code of conduct now stipulates 0
756130	I will also not exchange money offers of employment employment goods or services for sex or sexual favors in 0
762110	2011 the code only prohibited sex with 0
764180	beneficiaries and anyone under 18 what I specifically love about that language is it makes me feel like at least one of the people that 0
769630	Got in trouble was like it wasn't specifically in the rules that we should do this 0
773650	I didn't see the rules specifically that we weren't supposed to use 0
776420	Charitable funds to get these desperate women to have sex with us 0
779560	It feels like one of these guys were like no we were kick-starting the economy. We were creating jobs putting money in there 0
784150	No, I think most sane human beings go this is disgusting predatory behavior 0
787720	And that's on top of the gross misuse of charitable funds, and what seems to be a cover also 0
791500	There's been the question of well if Oxfam learned about this 0
793720	Why didn't they go to authorities according to Oxfam chief executive Mark gold? 0
797170	they didn't report the incident to local authorities because they were worried about the safety of the women at swine now following all this the 0
802510	UK's Department for International Development said in a statement we often work with organizations in chaotic and difficult circumstances if 0
808550	wrongdoing abuse fraud or criminal activity occur we need to know about it immediately in full the way this appalling abuse of vulnerable people was 0
814779	Dealt with raises serious questions that Oxfam must answer we acknowledge that hundreds of Oxfam staff have done 0
820060	No wrong and worked tirelessly for the people they serve 0
822399	But the handling by the senior team about this 0
824510	Investigation and their openness with us and the Charity Commission showed a lack of judgment we have a zero-tolerance 0
829100	Policy for the type of activity that took place in this instance and we expect our partners to as well adding the International Development Secretary 0
834730	Is reviewing our current work with Oxfam and has requested a meeting with a senior team at the earliest opportunity? 0
839149	And that was then followed by the International Development Secretary penny Moore dawn speaking on the issue Sunday 0
843910	I think it's shocking and it doesn't matter how good the? 0
848120	Safeguarding practices are in an organization 0
850970	If that organization does not have the moral 0
854449	Leadership to do the right thing and where in particular 0
857930	They have evidence of criminal activity to pass that information to the relevant authorities including 0
864949	Prosecuting authorities, that's that's an absolute absence of leadership 0
869180	So you feel that the doc's firm failed in its moral leadership? 0
872570	Yes, I do, but oh boys and girls the story is not over it appears that prostitution has been a long-standing 0
878089	Oxfam problem on Sunday an additional report came out claiming that Oxfam workers at Hughes prostitutes in Chad in 0
883820	2006 and here's the least shocking shocking news you'll get at the time Vann how her Mirren same guys Haiti was the country director for 0
890829	Chat former Chad aide workers said they would invite the women to parties 0
894040	We knew they weren't just friends with something else the source also said that one senior staff member was fired in 0
899000	2006 for misconduct relating to hiring prostitutes in chat Oxfam would not confirm that they had records of these incidents 0
904899	But did say that workers in Chad were under a strict curfew due to security concerns 0
908209	as far as what we've seen today today the deputy chief executive of Oxfam Great Britain penny Lorenz has resigned from her position and she 0
914740	said in a statement over the last few days 0
916329	We've become aware that concerns were raised about the behavior of staff and Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon 0
921639	It is now clear that these allegations involving the use of 0
924290	prostitutes in which related behavior of both the country director and members of his team in chad were raised before he moved to Haiti has 0
929930	program director at the time 0
931010	I am ashamed that this happened on my watch 0
932510	And I take full responsibility 0
933870	on response to these reports hades ambassador to the UK 0
936750	Said you might be dealing with a pedophile where prostitution is illegal and we believe they may have been underaged kids also adding Oxfam should 0
943279	Recognize they failed and showed a lack of leadership 0
945149	Adding that legal action against Oxfam was also being considered notes really where we end on this story of Oxfam trying to minimize the problem 0
951560	You know it's a it's a few bad apples but based off of this story 0
953870	It's hard to not think this is a much bigger issue 0
956390	I mean publicly in their annual report there were 87 allegations of sexual abuse by staff in 0
960990	2016 to 2017 that's only about what's being talked about above the board former International Development? 0
965540	Secretary Preity Patel has also said there is a culture of denial around 0
969360	Exploitation and sexual abuse and the aid sector and covering the story that we just covered 0
972770	It's hard not to think that the real numbers are much high you have people like Ronald Van Hauer Muir and who? 0
979050	Seemingly just went on shattered years and years 0
981959	Unchecked and when he did get in trouble Oxfam seemingly tried to bury the story the the real meat of the story to protect 0
989880	The public image of the the organization they they say to protect the women most likely to protect the funds they receive from the government 0
997040	Oxfam gets around a hundred seventy six million pounds a year from the government and other public authorities 0
1001150	And so it will be very interesting to see what further fallout 0
1003550	We see whether other resignations firing if the government decides to pull more funding 0
1008770	We'll have to wait and see and actually I want to just pass the question off to you 0
1011650	What is your takeaway from this when it comes to charities? 0
1014110	Are you very trusting you often do a lot of research to see how they spend their money? 0
1017870	What does this make you think about Oxfam in general as an entire organization? 0
1021410	I'd love to know your thoughts actually not just on this last one the last story the first one anything between I'd love to know 0
1026980	Your thoughts today 0
1027579	And that's actually where I'm going to end today's show and remember if you liked this video you like what I'm trying to do on 0
