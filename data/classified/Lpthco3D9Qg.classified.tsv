30	thank you master off for sponsoring this 1
1650	video at CES 2018 check out their 1
3659	Sennheiser 6xx headphones in the link in 1
6450	the description down below we are here 1
8280	at Coolermaster checking out their H 500 0
10769	m and no stops pulled case and we start 0
13440	off with four tempered glass panels one 0
16020	just on the sides you can see all the 0
17609	beautiful internals of your case one on 0
19529	the top and the front so you can see the 0
20970	fans and one on the back so you can see 0
22619	your cable management now the tempered 0
24150	glass panel on the front can slide out 0
26430	I'm not going to do it right now because 0
27779	prototype case and stuff but it can 0
29580	slide out and you can put in a mesh 0
31500	grille so if you're worried about the 0
33570	airflow it's fine don't worry about it 0
36030	it comes in the box no big deal but it 0
38250	does also have mesh on each side and 0
40410	along the top so that these four big 0
42750	fans can all breathe properly even if 0
44520	you do decide to leave that tempered 0
45809	glass in and right now at the show 0
48510	they're not filtered but they will be 0
50460	filtered once you guys are able to get 0
52020	it into your hands I have been told for 0
53489	front IO its kind of front slash top IO 0
56160	the power button is the Coolermaster 0
58350	logo but with no text in it nice and 0
60030	subtle and it has an illuminated ring 0
61920	around it to the right of that you've 0
63510	got a hard drive activity led to the 0
65129	left of that you have headphone and 0
66720	microphone jacks and then above you have 0
68640	tons of USB which is great to see you 0
71340	have four USB three type-a ports and one 0
73979	USB type-c port which is awesome I'm 0
76350	happy that cases are starting to have 0
77610	these on the front because you're 0
78960	starting to see more c2c cables out 0
80850	there in the wild which is really cool 0
82350	moving on to the inside of the case the 0
84509	main notable part that you're gonna see 0
86130	is the power supply shroud it's been 0
88200	around for a while now but this one does 0
89729	have a cutout again been around for a 0
92250	while now but this one is illuminated 0
94259	which is cool and there's the subtle 0
96630	outside halo logo as well I kind of 0
100229	maybe suggested that they also include a 0
102630	blank in the case just like how they had 0
104670	the mesh front they would have some swap 0
106409	ability for you and we'll we'll see what 0
109110	happens there just in case you have a 0
110520	different brand of power supply or you 0
112140	want to orientate it in a different way 0
113369	or something else there's also the 0
115500	ever-popular option to mount your 0
117299	graphics card vertically so if you don't 0
119670	have two cards like they have in this 0
121619	setup which is beautiful by the way but 0
123750	if you don't have two cards you want to 0
125189	have one and you want to display the 0
127049	really cool part of the card which you 0
128489	rarely actually get to see which is at 0
130169	the side with the fans on it you 0
131920	mounted vertically you might have also 0
133810	noticed that the lighting in the room 0
135459	has changed quite a bit while I've been 0
136870	hosting this video that is in sync with 0
139150	what's on screen it's called screen 0
140860	follow it has to do with their master 0
142750	Plus lighting control basically anything 0
145270	that can connect through Wi-Fi or the 0
147040	internet in your house or a 4-pin which 0
149470	like fans in the case and whatnot can 0
151600	all sync together and follow your screen 0
154030	or just be set to one color whatever you 0
156310	kind of want to do we even had something 0
157870	earlier 0
158380	where they brought paint up on the 0
159580	screen and then just made the whole 0
161290	paint a different color and all the 0
163810	lights in the room wouldn't follow that 0
165280	color it was pretty cool it's nice 0
167440	because with traditional setups they're 0
169269	all separate the Nano Leafs might be one 0
171670	one mode your computer might be on 0
173230	another mode other lighting in the room 0
174850	might be in another mode it gets kind of 0
176440	messy and you have all these different 0
177580	controllers and need to sync everything 0
179019	up and the not great with this setup 0
181900	it's all done through your computer you 0
183819	can nicely set it up on your desktop 0
185170	it's all handled it's all in one 0
187120	solution better that way 0
188350	and last but not least let's jump behind 0
190209	the motherboard panel we did already 0
191980	mention that there's tempered glass back 0
193330	here but a good pair for tempered glass 0
195819	behind another word panel is good cable 0
197980	management because if you have messy 0
199510	cables back there it's kind of a 0
201250	negative to have a tempered glass panel 0
202959	so they handle all of that for you which 0
204820	is really cool they have big panels 0
206560	covering up all the messy cables so you 0
208150	don't have to worry about it which is a 0
209470	huge benefit also of huge benefit thank 1
