0	Sup you beautiful bastards 0
1469	Hope you've had a fantastic Tuesday 0
3000	Welcome back to the Philip defranco show and let's just jump into it. And the first thing we're gonna jump into today is our 0
8370	Brand new game show what the f**k did he just say, starring today's contestant: Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino of course a very famous director 0
15330	And he's in the news today for two reasons the first one involves him doing an interview with Howard Stern some years back now 0
20890	And he says this: "Tarantino: look ok. I don't believe that's rape I believe it's against the law. Stern: Right. Tarantino: All right. Stern: I believe it's rape. 0
28000	Tarantino: I don't believe it's rape. I mean that (Intelligible). 0
30080	(Intelligible) 0
35469	So time to play the game did Tarantino say: A 0
38190	I don't believe it's rape not at 38 not for these fame-seeking 0
41260	blobs. B: I don't believe it's rape not at 18 not for these predatory model girls. or C: I don't believe it's rape not at 0
47760	13 not for these 13 year old party girls. And here is your answer: "Tarantino: look okay? 0
52680	I don't believe that's rape I believe it's against the law. Stern: Right. Tarantino: All right. Stern: I believe it's rape. 0
56489	Tarantino: I don't believe it's rape. I mean not at 13. Not for these 13 year old party girls. Stern: Really. 0
62180	Woman: 13-year-old party girls what is that?" 0
64780	If you're wondering why Tarantino said this he was defending Roman Polanski. Roman Polanski of course the director that gave a thirteen-year-old girl 0
72280	Alcohol pills had sex with her long story short 0
75270	He gets convicted had to flee the United States as far as why Tarantino is saying this wasn't rape he argued this point 0
80909	He didn't rape the 13 years. It was statutory rape all right 0
88990	It's not statutory rape you know he had sex with a minor alright 0
93299	That's not rape to me when you use the word rape great. You're talking about violent throwing him down 0
98340	It's like when the most violent crimes in the world you can't throw 0
100750	You know throw the word rape around is like throwing the word racist around 0
105729	China with a 13 year old girl you're in a grown man. You know that that's wrong because 0
115689	She was down with it you're killing him with the pills and booze. Why are true? 0
120640	Though it no more than if she was 18 or 19 or 20 Tarantino 0
124020	Just compared doing drugs with a 20 year old woman and a 13 year old girl. They're just equals 0
129899	I just I have a hard time seeing how you don't see this as rape you drama 0
133710	a 0
134050	40-ish year-old man and a 13 year old girl that he is plying with drugs and alcohol a girl that by the way has gone 0
139980	On the record of saying she said no that Polanski kept saying I'll take you home. She didn't want to do this 0
144840	He's got this thirteen year old girl who Polanski gave 0
147250	champagne to a 0
148480	quaalude - he said she starts feeling disoriented confused 0
150910	She fakes an asthma attack to get out of the hot tub because apparently they were doing a photo shoot 0
155490	Lansky in his book wrote we weren't saying much 0
157500	I could sense a certain erotic tension between us, but according to this girl's testimony before a grand jury question 0
163090	What did you do when he said let's go into the other room? I was going no 0
165870	I think I better go home because I was afraid so I just went and I sat down on the couch 0
169110	What were you afraid of him and so he went to the other room and sat down on the couch? 0
172200	Yes, what were you wearing at the time my underwear in a towel? 0
175050	What happened when you sat down on the couch he sat down beside me and asked me if I was okay? 0
179040	What did you say if anything? I said, no it did he say he goes well 0
182160	You'll be better and I go no I won't I have to go home what happened then he reached over 0
185640	And he kissed me and I was telling him 0
187200	No, you know keep away, but I was afraid of him because there was no one else there 0
190740	She says no. I have to go home 0
192120	He says soon 0
192990	And then she describes 0
194230	Polanski's assaults on her so that was one of the reasons 0
196320	Why turns Hina was in the news and I'd love to hear your thoughts are there and the other bit of Tarantino news is he? 0
200220	Has now responded to all the news that came out about uma Thurman over the weekend and yesterday in response to the New York Times 0
205410	Piece he said he knew it was happening. He said uma, and I talked about it 0
208050	She wanted footage of the crash 0
209100	So she could get clarity found it, and I was very happy to get it to him 0
212010	And he planned to meet up with the person doing the uma thurman piece 0
214350	But that never happened and so he felt like he was taking those to the heat 0
217260	He specifically says who mitigate the footage before because of Weinstein regarding pushing uma Thurman to drive that car she didn't feel comfortable 0
223390	With that she ended up crashing. He says I didn't go barging into much trailer screaming at her get in the car 0
227880	I can imagine maybe rolling my eyes. He does say though that he talked her into it, and he regrets this saying 0
232410	I told her it would be okay. I told her the road was a straight line 0
234630	I told her it would be safe, and it was and I was wrong I didn't force her into the car 0
237810	She got into it because she trusted me and she believed me 0
240180	But then when it came time to do the scene they changed the direction the car would be 0
243790	Driving and he didn't go and check the road that way 0
246030	I thought a straight road as a straight road 0
247380	And I didn't think I needed to run the road again to make sure there wasn't any difference going in the opposite direction 0
251260	again 0
251760	That is one of the biggest regrets of my life now regarding the anger around the reporting that it was 0
256000	Tarantino that for a scene choked uma Thurman that it was Tarantino that spit in her face 0
260399	He said naturally I did it who else should do it a grip regarding the choking 0
263460	He said that was uma thurman's idea and as far as the spitting and Huma Thurman's face 0
266850	He said it essentially like art-direction saying now 0
269490	I love Michael he's a terrific actor 0
270960	But I didn't trust him with this kind of intricate work of nailing this so the idea is I'm doing it 0
274590	I'm taking responsibility also. I'm the directors so I can kind of art direct to this spit 0
278340	I know where I want it to land 0
279330	I'm right next to camera so boom I do and so that's where we are right now with Tarantino is fires on two fronts 0
284500	One seemingly bigger than the other to me 0
287010	I personally think that if here is someone that is defending a grown-ass adult children let alone 0
292270	Fucking a child that they then plied with booze and drugs you're garbage, and I think you need to be thrown out 0
298080	But that said I will pass a question off to you 0
299910	What are your thoughts around this situation you agree disagree some of the people that disagree? 0
303870	I see they say you know there are different culture Nina feels like a horrible argument 0

399970	He's very large on Instagram some other places 0
402310	He said to be in the upcoming movie the hate you give but then there was a lot of controversy around him because this video 0
408040	Went viral 0
416419	Now if you're wondering did he actually say yeah, yeah? 0
419650	It seems like at least once maybe twice as far as when this happened when this was filmed it appears 0
423820	This is not new it was filmed between three to six years ago 0
427060	It's still as you would expect there was a lot of people angry 0
429280	It was tons of backlash with many people pointing that Keane was set to star in the film the hate you give the film rap 0
433900	production last fall 0
434830	It's an adaptation of Angie Thomas's book of the same name story deals with racial issues and police brutality 0
439550	The main character as a black teenage girl Qian was cast as her boyfriend 0
443240	but after the video resurfaced many people said that his past actions made him unfit to play this role in response to the backlash we 0
449020	Saw Angie Thomas tweet yes, I've seen it. Yes. I'm sighing the shit out of the person no excuses no 0
454030	I won't say what it is until more is revealed, but yes. I saw it 0
457360	We then saw kyun respond to the backlash writing on Twitter if you don't learn from your mistakes 0
461169	You can never grow as a person. I've learned a lot, and I am grateful to have the power to change 0
464740	I never want to be who I was yesterday 0
466180	We're in a constant battle to become a better version of ourselves use your voice as your weapon after his post went off 0
471010	We also saw angie post several tweets seemingly about all the hate. She has been receiving from this controversy writing 0
476110	Y'all are screenshotting me and coming up my friends without knowing the details of the situation 0
479710	There is so much more that you don't know and I'm honestly sad for you, but I'm unprofessional 0
483250	Oh only a new half of what I've gone through because of this half of the tears that have been shed the 0
487760	Disappointment and heartbreak everything I've tweeted is out of sheer disappointment in someone. I love they knew I know that's all that matters 0
493419	I've been hurt severely, but please make me the bad guy 0
495610	Please call out black women and attack us you have no clue what I'm dealing with and following all of this twentieth Century Fox released 0
501400	This statement saying due to controversy surrounding his past comments behavior 0
505120	Qian Lally will no longer appear in the hate you give the studio plans to recast the role of Chris and 0
509840	Reshoot scenes as needed following this can release a statement saying where it's at power and can do damn it 0
514539	I own mine 0
515140	And I am sorry 0
515950	I respect Fox's decision to recast this role for the hate you give as it is an important story 0
520029	And it would not be appropriate for me to be involved 0
522080	considering the actions of my past I understand the impact and I have grown and learned since then now on I plan to use my 0
527020	Voice for positive and actually where I want to end this story 0
529600	I mean we talked about the Tarantino thirteen-year-old girl's story now 0
533200	We have key in here both of those were technically things in the past obviously there are differences with Tarantino 0
538630	We're talking about the rape of a 13 year old girl T 0
541660	And we're talking about a horrible word ian was a teenager 0
544040	Tarantino definitely wasn't and as we recording this video kyun has said he was sorry that it was wrong that he's trying to grow he 0
549370	Agrees with himself getting fired, and we don't have a statement from Tarantino yet, so I guess the main question 0
554330	I'm trying to get out. There is when when you look at things that people have said or done in the past 0
559610	Where is the line for where you will still hold it against them and where you will know and understand? 0
564670	I am NOT making a statement with that question 0
566800	I am actually just genuinely interested, then let's talk about the stock market specifically the Dow Jones Industrial film more than 1,000 points Monday 0
573910	Which was its biggest drop ever asterisk which will get so we also saw a European and Asian market seemingly affected 0
580030	But not as much. What's up? 0
581290	How did we get here well stocks have actually been rising for a few years now? 0
584650	And I major reason for this has been the strength and optimism in the US economy profits have excelled 0
589180	We've seen President Trump pushing for lower taxes reduced regulation 0
592660	we've all seen the lowest global interest rates since World War two interest rates changed the rate at which banks borrow money so if the 0
597940	Rates are high that means borrowing money is more expensive and depositing and selling off is more attractive the idea was that if more people 0
603650	Invested the market companies could invest more in their business and hire more workers all of which made investors 0
608630	excited and the global economy 0
609770	Started to grow but obviously something happened with the market on Friday and Monday the US Federal Reserve has raised rates for the past two 0
615250	Years, so that's not necessarily the reason for the reason fall 0
617560	We're seeing there are some experts pointing to the more recent changes in the American job market the worry isn't stemming from a lack of 0
622510	Jobs unemployment has actually fallen it appears to actually be because wages may be increasing for American workers higher wages for American workers could mean 0
630020	Inflation which could mean the Federal Reserve would need to raise rates even more rapidly what a big thing to note is as of right? 0
635140	Now this doesn't appear to be some end of days scenario despite 0
638290	Whatever graphic package you may have seen on TV the Dow at one point fell more than 1,000 points yesterday 0
642850	Which is the biggest point drop ever but not really and it's the percentage that matters more well 0
647800	This was the largest drop it was only a drop of four point six percent right so still the largest the most meaningful drop 0
653020	we've seen in the Dow was 508 points in 1987 because I was a 0
656750	22.6% crash and what we're seeing with this drop is it just returns a market back to levels we saw in December 0
661520	Does that mean everything's going to be okay? 0
663320	I don't know 0
664130	I'm not an economist, but there are a few things that we can take away from this situation one 0
667850	There is no such thing as a sure thing 0
669530	Two we will have to wait and see if this is the beginning of some sort of crash or just some regular 0
674250	Market correction and three. I think the president is going to have to figure out for the long term 0
678860	How closely he wants to connect himself to the stock market in that last part? 0
682520	I mean in general moving forward outside of this this drop that we saw right the markets in a fluctuate 0
686900	It's not a rollercoaster that never goes down even today after we saw it going all over the place the Dow Jones 0
691560	Went up two point three three percent there has already been a decent amount of criticism of 0
696180	President Trump in his tweets and speeches taking a lot of credit for the stock market any of those who have been critical is saying 0
701720	That he inherited this for Obama along with unemployment several other things 0
705800	he's taking credit for a trend but on the other hand you have people saying you know well the market reacts in real time when 0
710510	President Trump was elected many people expect that it would crash. It's right. He's been president for a year now 0
715640	He's pushed through economic change. He has had an impact personally 0
718520	I think it's a little bit of both 0
719300	but it will be very interesting over the coming weeks in the coming months to see what happens with the market and also how that 0
725390	Affects Donald Trump, and what he says about the stock market and actually since we did mention the president 0
729380	There's some housekeeping to be done there with news the House Intelligence Committee vote and approve on releasing the Democrats memo is of course meant 0
735980	To be the counter to the Nunez memo that then headed to the White House as of right now White House chief of staff John 0
740510	Kelly says he hasn't read it yet, but he will be briefed soon 0
743450	So there was that there was also continued negotiation regarding border security the wall and dacha regarding dacha John 0
749840	Kelly said it is very unlikely that the president is going to extend the deadline for daca, which is March 5th adding mr. 0
755810	Obama established a program, and it was considered to be 0
758310	Unconstitutional not based on any law so the extension 0
760370	I'm not so sure the president this president has the authority to extend it and because it seems like 0
764520	Negotiations are not going exceptionally well. It looks like this Thursday 0
768200	We may be staring at another government shutdown I mean 0
770600	This is something that is not shocking at all and he's worth president feel like he is leaning over 0
774600	Backwards saying you know we will take care of 1.8 million dreamers. There are 600 90,000 official daca 0
781860	Registrants and 0
784270	The president sent over what amounts to be two and a half times that number to 0
790540	1.8. Million the general mindset is he's not meeting them halfway 0
793330	He's going above and beyond so give him the wall whereas those were still against him are still saying 0
797790	No 0

804420	part of it 0
804930	There is the big chain migration family 0
807610	Reunification arguments a point the president seems pretty locked down on so much so that he said this if we don't change it 0
812790	Let's have a shutdown will do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country 0
817360	I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of so once again here. We are 0
822960	We'll have to wait and see what happens, but that said that's where I'm gonna end this of course 0
827130	This is the Philip DeFranco show it's the story. It's my opinion and now I want to hear from you 0
831270	Whether it be the last one the first one anything in between let me know in those comments down below 0
