30	Sup you beautiful bastards, hope you had a fantastic 0
2710	Wednesday welcome back to the philip defranco show and let's just jump into this and the main thing we're gonna talk about today is some 0
8880	more of the fallout around the parkland shooting and then some of the just insanity and 0
15160	Ridiculousness that we've seen around this story. The first part of this is something that actually happened as yesterday's show was going on yesterday 100 0
21029	students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School traveled seven hours to the Florida House of 0
24580	Representatives to watch a vote. This because the house was voting on a motion for debate on a bill that could ban the sale of assault 0
29189	weapons and ultimately in just three minutes the House voted down the motion 71 to 36 0
33660	just so you understand the full situation here the bill would have banned large capacity magazines also labelling weapons such as the 0
39010	Ar-15 as assault weapons and then banned that was actually assigned to three committees in the house 0
43410	but those committees weren't actually scheduled to meet again before the 0
45879	Legislative session ends on March 9 and that essentially meant the bill was dead unless the House voted to open debate up again 0
51090	Which they did not,  then following the decision we saw the students there and attendance obviously upset lots of photos of students crying in the gallery 0
57180	Were spreading online one in particular that blew up was of Cheryl aqua 0
60539	Laurie a 16 year old junior from the high school after the vote 0
63180	She said it was just so heartbreaking to see how many voters names were up there. Especially after it was my school 0
67200	It seemed almost heartless how they immediately pushed the button to say no they had the chance to stop it today 0
71460	If there is another mass shooting it's going to be their fault 0
73799	We've also seen a lot of outrage stemming from this session this because in the same session where the House voted no the House passed 0
80070	a resolution declaring 0
81130	pornography a public health risk Democratic congressman carlos guillermo smith saying unfortunately just five days after 0
85780	17 people were gunned down at a florida school the Florida House just passed a bill that declares pornography a public health risk basically what? 0
91409	They have determined is that these are the Republican priorities in? 0
93820	2018 wasting our time with debate and legislation that declares porn as a health threat meanwhile 0
98070	We can't even get a single debate vote or hearing on anything related to assault weapon now from this part of the story 0
102689	I just want to preface it with I am going to try and stay calm and 0
107500	Compose I can easily do that with the first part of the story 0
110369	It's a vote a lot of people have a lot of different opinions regarding gun laws 0
114100	Ar-15 s things of that kind. I will let you know right at the beginning for transparencies sake I have been 0
120909	Infuriated by everything else we're about to talk about I'm also aware that with how much support some of the pure insanity 0
127560	We're going to jump into has this will likely result in this video being disliked bombed 0
132239	I welcome you those one subscribe and make a big deal about it or threaten to unsubscribe 0
136780	Please do take this moment to do that we will be better off without you in my opinion 0
142380	That's a let's jump into the second part of this story 0
144270	So if you haven't seen there has been a concerted effort since the shooting to discredit 0
148540	Attack muck and just plain lie about these survivors of this school shoot and the first thing 0
154050	We'll hit on is the mocking and dinesh d'souza 0
156250	In response to the decision in florida and specifically an article from the hill that read breaking florida lawmakers 0
161260	Reject phil to ban assault rifles days after school shooting the nash tweeted adults one 0
165880	Kid zero following that and responds to a picture of the survivors of this school shooting crying with the TAC AP photo of school shooting 0
172590	Survivors watching florida lawmakers vote down a bill to ban assault weapons Dinesh wrote worse news since their parents told them to get summer jobs 0
179550	And I want to say this to the nation' anyone that support of those tweets go fuck yourself 0
184260	in your garbage face you stupid motherfucker if you weren't already you definitely are now a 0
189100	Trash person and now just more people know about it is one thing to disagree with someone's opinions their activism 0
194670	It is a whole other thing to 0
196450	openly mock the 0
197709	survivors of a school shooting and when I tweeted something to this extent there were some people saying off Phil's showing his liberal bias in 0
203280	My eyes, this is not a partisan issue well. Well Dinesh is a conservative political commentator a conservative filmmaker 0
208709	I do not think he represents everyone that is right lean in my eyes 0
212550	You have people that are generally on the lap people that are generally on the right 0
215310	And then the assholes here Dinesh is an asshole and so rightly so we saw people from all parts of the political spectrum 0
221709	Speaking out against Annette this ranging from Mother Jones is editor-in-chief all the way to Ben Shapiro 0
226890	Also, if I can just have a quick aside here 0
228570	I kind of want to give a tip of the hat to Ben Shapiro 0
230580	And and his website daily wire you may enjoy him or maybe you don't like him you disagree with their politics the the stuff they 0
236760	Put out they recently announced. They are no longer going to show the faces of mass murderers. It's something 0
241620	We've done here on the show for a long time 0
243150	It's something we have preached for a long time so anytime anyone with an audience whatsoever adopts this 0
248010	I am a fan, but back to the story 0
249450	We also saw two Sue's that even denounced by the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC if you don't know are an annual 0
254650	Conservative event he's reportedly been a featured speaker several times 0
257519	We saw a user tweeting at CPAC riding a ACU 0
260079	Conservative might want to cancel Dinesh D'Souza's at CPAC right about now you draw a line at one of your speakers openly mocking child survivors 0
265890	Of Florida school shooting, and they responded with hey Raphael 0
268410	This is fake news National, Sousa is not a speaker at CPAC 2018 0
271889	You are seeing an archive speaker profile 0
273660	And we are taking down his archived picture his comments are indefensible now as far as D'Souza yesterday 0
278220	We saw him then add genuine grief I can empathize with but grief organized for the cameras politically orchestrated 0
282970	Grief strikes me as phony an inauthentic 0
284610	Well the media exploits the parkland shooting my heart goes out to the parents and family members who are grieving the loss of loved ones 0
289740	Which I will say personally strikes me as phony like how can you tweet my heart goes out to the parents and family members who? 0
294900	Are grieving the loss of loved ones when you're tweeting. Oh don't one kids zero 0
298979	This is almost as bad when those stupid entitled kids have to get a job for the summer following all of this this morning Dinesh 0
304169	Tweeted while it aimed at media manipulation my tweet was insensitive to students who lost friends and a terrible tragedy. I'm truly sorry 0
309630	He's apologized. He's trying to make it about me media manipulation 0
313030	Exploitation that doesn't seem to match up with his previous statements, but okay 0
316560	Whatever they comment quickly on the idea that these these children those survivors of this shooting are being exploited 0
321719	I would argue that we need to say all or not what I mean by that is if we have the victims and survivors of 0
326639	a of a shooting of any tragedy whatsoever and they want to talk to the media or they want their story shared 0
333580	We should allow it same as we would allow President Trump during the State of the Union to provide many 0
338440	Examples many victims and their stories someone's daughter was killed by ms-13. Let's share that story 0
343800	Let's talk about it if someone shoots up a school 0
346560	And you survived and you you think that maybe something can be done, so this doesn't happen to someone else let's talk about it 0
351930	Why are we picking and choosing when we can share stories? 0
354419	why is it when an illegal immigrant or someone who came here legally went through the right processes or a 0
358960	Refugee does something horrible? 0
360360	We can immediately talk about immigration and border security 0
362979	and it's not politicized when it becomes a different situation like how does a 19 year old legally get an ar-15 same day then that's 0
370509	exploitation manipulation when someone speaks out and I say this and I always get a lot of international hate for this I 0
375460	Support the Second Amendment personal, it's a massive issue 0
377909	But I think at the very least we can talk about mental health we can talk about 0
381190	Access we can talk about better background checks. We can talk about better points of sale 0
384479	Why are we depriving a common sense conversation any oxygen? 0
387029	But all of that said the mocking around this situation was nowhere near the worst thing about it conspiracy 0
392250	Theory is around the Parkland shooting range from okay 0
395099	That's kind of crazy to just 0
396759	Batshit disgusting and ridiculous one of the main conspiracy theories revolves around david hog you may remember him 0
402250	He's one of the students that we talked about standing up speaking out 0
405160	He also helped announce the march for our lives event what we've seen since the shooting is that hog and several other 0
409970	outspoken students have been accused of being 0
411950	Crisis actors Aaron literally claiming Hogg and others are paid to travel to disaster sites and argue for stricter gun laws and let's actually talk 0
418510	About the evidence being used against David hog 0
420940	I saw this being pushed by Infowars a 0
423290	Correspondent for the gateway Punda and people saying David Hogs having trouble reciting his lines and let's actually look at the video 0
428380	They're talking about when we heard the first gunshot. We initially thought. It was a drill. That was a bad choice 0
435410	Actually that was bad choice because the jannat 0
440810	People are sharing this video saying see he's been trained to say some things as proof 0
445270	there's an agenda at all I see there as a teenager trying to talk about a traumatic moment in his life as cleanly as 0
450830	Possible in an interview if it's not live try and say what you're trying to say as cleanly as possible people pointing to the person 0
456070	Behind the camera saying it's fine as if he was coaching him 0
458710	He didn't try and twist it to fit that narrative, but that just sounds like a producer saying like it's okay. Just you're fine 0
463330	It's come you you take your time 0
465410	We're gonna shoot this piece anyway people sharing a video over the past 24 hours saying boom damning proof of that 0
470440	Hog is a crisis actor, and it's a video of David hog on CBS. He's labeled as witness 0
475270	It's news out of California chose one of Hogg's friends and other teenagers are confronting a lifeguard get people saying boom 0
479890	Here's the evidence. Hog is a crisis actor 0
482200	How is it in 2017 he's in California for this so then in 2018 he's at this school and Florida 0
488260	He's involved in this shooting and speaking out we answer that is simple a hog lived in California, and then several years ago 0
494169	He moved to Florida and sometimes he still visits his old friends while he was back in California visiting this happened 0
500530	Which then connects to another conspiracy theory that hog actually graduated from high school in? 0
506300	California doesn't even go to school in parkland 0
508840	Florida people sharing this Facebook post this photo saying look look at the yearbook its facts. I guess what turns out that's fake news 0
515349	Thanks to a student who had their Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School the school in Florida's yearbook and boom 0
520120	There is the other reports were fake news 0
522860	Misleading reports doesn't stop it from being shared because fuck it it fits our narrative 0
526630	Also thing to note is that video showing david hog in 0
529400	California for that news report that has since been removed from YouTube before it was removed 0
533470	It was actually the number one 0
534890	Trending video on the website which a lot of people have given YouTube a lot of hate about and I will say well 0
539560	I understand the anger looking at the title I can understand 0
541990	How it slipped through the title of the video doesn't lead you to believe that it's being used as misleading 0
546050	propaganda once you actually look at the the description the 0
549230	Comments where where the traffic's coming from you can see that it is 0
551980	But they did end up removing the videos saying that it violates YouTube's policy on harassment and bullying also issuing a statement saying this video 0
558010	Should never have appeared in trending because the video contained footage from an authoritative news source our system is classified as soon as we became 0
563170	Aware of the video we removed it from trending and from YouTube for violating our policies 0
566560	We are working to improve our systems moving forward and as it right now. That's the ultimate batshit-crazy claim 0
570910	There are also some that claim the students are connected and working with the FBI 0
573530	People saying this seemed to feel like it's definitely true because hogs father worked for the FBI also a thing to note as these batshit 0
578960	Conspiracy theories didn't just stay online we saw it actually bleed into real-life 0
584000	politics in fact an aide to a Florida state lawmaker was fired Tuesday for pushing this crisis actor theory Laura Representative Shawn Harrison's District Attorney 0
591470	Benjamin Kelly he reportedly sent an email to a Tampa Bay Times reporter in response to a story about how online 0
596600	Conspiracy theorists have attacked student survivors of the school shooting the papers 0
599930	Washington bureau chief Alex Leary 0
601640	Tweeted out that email and the email from Benjamin Kelly read both kids in the picture are not students here 0
606730	But actors that travel to various crisis when they happen and Alex Leary saying in his tweet 0
611110	Here's the email I asked for more information to back up the claim and was sent another email that link to a YouTube conspiracy video 0
616270	And the video he reportedly linked was the video of David Hogg and a news report in California following all of this 0
620980	Florida State Representative Sean Harrison later tweeted tonight mr.. Kelly was terminated from his position as my district secretary 0
626110	I am appalled at and strongly denounced his comments about the Parkland students. I'm again 0
630070	Sorry for any pain this has caused the grieving families of this tragedy also saw Kelly 0
633800	Delete his Twitter account, but not before saying I've been terminated from the Statehouse 0
637600	I made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of 0
640100	Information relating to his story regarding a school shooting this was not my responsibility 0
643600	I meant no disrespect to the students or parents of parkland so we apologize 0
647080	But just for responding to the reporter not for promoting a conspiracy theory okay. You know just looking at this situation 0
652820	I mean it was already a horrible situation, but but the fact that real politicians that real 0
659780	Survivors are having to say no this actually happened. No one's faking it. We're we're not we're not being used 0
666070	We're wanting to talk. It's incredibly troubling 0
668290	I saw Marco Rubio have two tweets and claiming some of the students on TV after Parkland are actors is the work of a disgusting 0
673690	group of idiots with no sense of decency 0
675740	tackling Korean one of the five students who announced March for our lives tweeted our kids not actors 0
680140	We are kids that have grown up in parkland all of our lives 0
682240	We are kids who feared for our lives while someone shot up our school. We are kids working to prevent this from happening again 0
687010	We are kids diego Pfeiffer a Stoneman Douglas senior saying this those people that are calling us 0
692270	Crisis actors or actors in general you know what I want to go to school for musical theater 0
697210	I would love to be an actor no joke but but honestly 0
702589	The people here and the people that we left behind with the people that are no longer with us 0
707380	they are not acting they are dead so have that other people tell me that my 0
711500	Mourn my grief is not real that I'm just acting it out 0
715029	I would love to be that good of an actor trust me I would 0
717710	But I'm not and this is real also hearing from Sam Fuentes another senior from the high school who sustained multiple injuries you cannot look? 0
725170	me in the face and 0
727070	Tell me what happened isn't real 0
730070	You can't tell me in my face that this violence does not occur not after you've lost your friends 0
736850	Not after you've lost people you've known for so long and of course David hog. Haven't go on TV to say no 0
742240	I'm not a crisis actor. I'm not an actor in any sense way shape or form. I'm not a crisis actor 0
747220	I'm somebody that had to witness this and live through this and I continue to have to do that 0
751240	Also, interestingly enough during the interview David hog even says that he's Pro Second Amendment 0
755200	But he just wants to talk about background checks and access and the ar-15 these people keep saying that I'm anti Second Amendment 0
760960	I'm not I 0
762200	would love if I want every American to be able to own a gun that has a mentally stable mind a 0
769910	Person that has a credible background that doesn't have any previous like major 0
774350	convictions and 0
775130	Somebody that's not going to go out and commit these atrocities because those are the people that are at fault here 0
779320	This is an addition to video David hog put out on his own YouTube channel two days after the shooting with several other students from 0
785140	The schools just pointing out 0
786339	we're not actor unfortunately it only really seems to have been picked up by a lot of people who think that he's an actor and 0
792290	Harassing him in the comments even calling him soy boy is extremely feminine 0
796320	Onto you you little twerp people calling him an outright liar 0
798820	Here's the thing it is okay to disagree 0
801370	With David and any of these other students or anyone that supports that I think you can 100% acknowledge that on this topic 0
807930	They're very very left, and they're trying to push an agenda disagree with them 0
811740	But don't openly slander them creating these insane conspiracy theories 0
816150	So you don't have to talk about the real issues also to bring it back to earlier 0
818910	Don't openly mocked um's of a crime with all of that said where I actually want to end this story today is around the heroes 0
825540	And the victims last week we talked about Aaron Feist the football coach who died shielding students from gunfire 0
830970	he also mentioned Scott beagle who was killed after unlocking his door and letting students in to hide from the gunman and since then we've 0
836280	Learned about students like Peter when Peter was a 15 year old member of the Junior ROTC 0
839980	Reportedly he was killed while holding the door open so others could escape from the gunman the stories around Peters heroism also 0
845190	Led to an online petition for him to get a burial with full military honors 0
847980	And while full military burial honors are not generally given unless the deceased was active duty the US Army ended up finding a way to 0
853620	honor Peter Peter and two other freshman JROTC cadets who also died in this shooting Martin Duque Elena petit were all awarded a medal of 0
860580	Heroism classmates and family members also said the Peter dreamed of attending the US Military Academy at West Point yesterday the day of his funeral 0
866640	the Academy announced his admission and a statement the Academy is saying the US Military Academy wants to pass on our deepest condolences to the 0
872310	Hwang family in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school community Peter weighing at a lifetime goal to attend USM a and was posthumously 0
877870	offered admission for his heroic action it was an appropriate way for us MA to honor this brave young man West Point has given posthumous 0
884100	Offers of admissions in very rare instances for those candidates or potential candidates whose actions exemplify the tenets of duty honor and country we also 0
890940	Have the story of Anthony Borges he's a 15 year old student was shot five times 0
894610	Protecting 20 students from gun firing that he was reportedly shot in his back and legs as he locked the door and blocked the doorway 0
900090	With his body 0
900780	And so thanks to his actions and no one else in the classroom was injured student was reportedly in that room saying none of us 0
905190	Knew what to do he took the initiative to just save his other classmates and after the shooting Anthony was taken to the hospital 0
909970	Initially he was in critical condition, but the good news is he is now in fair and stable condition 0
914520	That said he still has a long road ahead of him with many more surgeries to come people have started a GoFundMe 0
919840	Page for him that I'll link down below, and that's where I'm gonna end this one 0
922900	This is by no means all of the heroes from that day 0
925860	And I mean that across the board the individual actions of certain survivors as well as all the first responders with all that said 0
931770	That's where I'm going to end today's show remember if you liked this video you want to help spread some truth in the face of 0
936550	fucking ridiculous crazy news 0
938380	Hit the like button you can share the video and also a big THANK YOU to the people that helped make this show everything that 0

959130	But also it enables me to be able to talk about these these very 0
961990	Advertiser unfriendly stories or in instances like today's video allows me to just take all ads off 0
967020	and it makes it so that we don't have to shy away from the real shit that we do need to talk about that's where 0
971010	I'm going to end today's show I just want to say I love you faces, and I'll see you tomorrow 0
