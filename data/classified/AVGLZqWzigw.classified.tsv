360	Sup you beautiful bastards, hope you're having a fantastic Friday! Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show 0
4840	And if you're new here, on Fridays we do things a little bit different. 0
7500	I try to cover more viewer requested stories, stories we were going to include, 0
10580	but for times sake to try and get out even remotely on time, we had to cut. 0
13860	So with that said, let's just jump into it 0
15800	and the first thing I want to talk about today is a very strange update around the Parkland, Florida shooting. 0
19980	It's one of the things we mentioned yesterday 0
21180	Is that there were reports that the shooter in this school shooting was actually connected to a white nationalist organization--an organization called Republic of Florida. 0
28520	It was all over the place, The Associated Press tweeting, "Breaking leader of white nationalist group has confirmed suspect in 0
32920	Florida school shooting was a member of his organization," and that person they're talking about is a guy 0
36560	by the name of Jordan Jereb. According to reports, he gave statements to multiple media outlets 0
40440	We also saw reports that there were first-hand confirmations from former students that he was a part of this organization 0
45520	So we had that, but then we got new information. 0
47530	Lieutenant Grady Jordan, who is a spokesperson for the Leon County Sheriff's Office in Tallahassee 0
51420	He said that his officers arrested militia leader Jordan Jereb at least four times since January 2014. They've been monitoring the group's membership, 0
57500	saying he has very solid information on the group 0
59460	There's no known ties that we have that we can connect the shooter with the group. 0
63160	So now we have law enforcement saying we're very knowledgeable of this group, 0
65280	we've been monitoring them, but we can't confirm any connection as of right now. 0
68420	So the question becomes how can we have Jordan Jereb doing all of these interviews and so when we have one part of the story 0
73680	and then we're supposedly getting confirmation that former students are saying yes 0
77759	He was a part of the organization 0
79150	Well, according to new reports 0
80140	Jordan Jereb is now walking back his claims. An account attributed to Jordan Jereb on the social network, Gab, writing, "Those of you calling me a 0
86640	Fake white nationalist go fuck yourselves. There was a legit misunderstanding because we have multiple people name *omitted* in ROF. 0
92240	And I got a bunch of conflicting information, and I have not slept for like two days, and so when (((They))) 0
97200	[and also by the way if you ever see something with three parenthesis, they're talking about Jewish people] 0
101500	call me up and ask me yes-or-no questions, it's easy for them to misrepresent what I say. 0
104700	Are you really going to blame ME for the lying Jew media? We know they're liars. Fuck 'em." 0
108740	And as far as the other sources from ABC News 0
110560	That there are also reports that maybe that was just people on 4chan fucking with ABC News. 0
116000	So at least for this part of the story it looks like it's a mixture of people that were trying to fuck with the media, 0
120260	as well as someone that either was confused, or was just purposefully lying. 0
124520	Also, it appears that the reason journalists even reached out to Jordan in the first place 0
128560	is because the anti-defamation league saw conversations on 4chan, but this explanation really doesn't make sense to me 0
133550	I mean I wouldn't be shocked to find out a white nationalist was a fucking idiot. Either that he was actually 0
137790	Confused which once again really does seem like a lie because there are several 0
141180	Statements that he reportedly gave to several media outlets or that he was a fucking idiot and that he thought this was a great way 0
145760	to get promotion for his organization 0
146849	or for himself which actually based off of other reporting from his past it does seem like he would do anything to get some attention 0
152670	although that still feels weird because you would think connecting a mass murderer to yourself or your 0
158250	organization would be bad news even with Jordan saying we didn't say to do this 0
162230	We don't support this, 0
163230	still looks bad but many a point I am still incredibly skeptical of all information around this specific aspect of the story, 0
169160	but I felt it incredibly important to update you guys because as I've stated before, I will always try to make sure the information I 0
175250	get in front of you is as accurate as possible and when we come across things that it turns out the reporting was bad or 0
180980	it was incorrect, or was part of a hoax 0
182299	I want to always make sure we update clarify and correct that and still for some reason this morning 0
186650	there are some outlets still running with the story despite the new information that has since come out now with that said I think it's 0
191090	incredibly important that we talk about the other updates around this story because while the republic of Florida angle the Jordan Jereb angle is 0
196560	actually an important part of the story now because it shows the potential pitfalls in 0
200489	reporting, the people knowingly trying to mislead the media 0
203239	and thus the public. Ultimately, the big reason why it was being reported on in the first place is to answer the question of 0
208100	why, and also who knew, also why did this happen could this have been stopped? Well, according to a new FBI 0
212819	statement that came out today... 0
214200	Maybe. The FBI released a statement today saying, On January 5th 0
217530	2018, a person close to the shooter contacted the FBI's public access line tip line to report concerns about it. The caller provided information about 0
224419	the shooter's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a school 0
230959	shooting. Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life. The information then should have been 0
236959	forwarded to the FBI Miami field office where appropriate 0
239669	investigative steps would have been taken. We have determined that these protocols were not followed for the information 0
244290	received by the PAL on January 5th. The information was not provided to the Miami Field Office and no further investigation 0
249870	was conducted at that time. FBI director Christopher Wray's saying we are still investigating the facts 0
254329	I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter as well as reviewing our 0
258298	processes for responding to information that we received from the public 0
260779	It's up to all Americans to be vigilant and when members of the public contact us with concerns, 0
264560	we must act properly and 0
265750	quickly. We have spoken with victims and families and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy 0
270950	All of the men and women of the FBI are dedicated to keeping the American people safe and are relentlessly committed to improving all that we 0
276730	do and how we do it. And so with this new information I want to pass the question off to you 0
280850	What do you feel about this? What do you think? Then with the daily outrage news 0
284230	We had people angry at YouTube over this tweet reading "Roses are red, Violets are blue, 0
289820	Subscribe to black creators" and in response to this there were people supporting and retweeting and people saying yes, 0
294010	this is great, the promotion of people subscribing to channels for an underrepresented community awesome 0
298390	We also had a lot of people saying this is racist, it's ridiculous, and some saying it's pandering. People are saying 0
303340	why are you telling people to subscribe to someone because of the color of their skin? 0
306430	Some of the people annoyed by this tweet included black YouTube creators like Skye Williams Skye essentially calling bullshit tweeting 0
311500	"I am a black creator. When I made a video discussing black issues, you flagged it, claimed 0
315100	I was quote 0
315830	Inciting racism against people of color struck my channel and took everything from me. Then your staff pretended to care by setting up a meeting 0
321790	that was due four months ago. Delete this." Adding. "You don't care about black creators, 0
325780	you care about docile black people who see a dumbass tweet like this and think it actually means something. You're creating your own black friends 0
331750	so you can prove you're not racist at dinner parties 0
333350	Delete this. We black readers are fucking fantastic with or without you and your soapbox. 0
337100	Don't tell people to fucking sub to me because I'm black I want people to sub to me because I'm a fucking excellent content creator. 0
342340	This shows you don't even watch black creators. Delete this, also hitting a note 0
345520	that a lot of other content creators hit as well tweeting 0
347680	"Subscribe to creators who make you laugh, who make you experience emotion, who value you as a fan, who 0
352760	challenges your way of thinking, who helps you cope when things get rough, who you relate to who inspires you and none of the 0
358160	aforementioned reasons are specific to race. Now, as far as my opinion on this, I kinda just didn't care. 0
362890	I just saw this is YouTube continuing their Black History Month push 0
365710	I mean head on to their Twitter page with hash tag create black history, their bio subscribe to black creators check the link in our 0
370840	profile for a new feature channel every day this month. It is in general 0
373630	I've always looked at YouTube as kind of one of those organizations that seems to be competing in the woek Olympics 0
378940	and they're always going for gold and the cynical part of my brain thinks that the person that thought of this campaign feels like Khaleesi and 0
384250	that one memed scene. Also, from a marketing standpoint 0
386290	I think you'd got a lot less push back if you just featured creators 0
389229	and you didn't say just subscribe to this creator because of the color of their skin. One, racial groups already do that especially if they're 0
394599	underrepresented in mainstream media, I mean, just look at the Asian on YouTube 0
398509	It is thriving. It is just gonna happen naturally so to YouTube saying do it for this specific reason, 0
403939	it's not really gonna be helpful, but I also do understand 0
406549	why some people may be bothered by this, 0
408209	especially the Skye Williamses of the world. If I was in his position, 0
410989	I would 100% see this is an empty fake gesture, but that said I do want to pass a question off to you 0
415579	What is your takeaway from this whole situation? I'd love to know your thoughts and those comments down below. But from that, 0
420619	I want to share some stuff 0

500309	there's gonna be a lot of ways to use these things for convenience. 0
503740	Well, that said, I do pass the question off to you 0
504869	What did you feel when you first saw this and also are you excited or? 0
508469	freaked out by it? I'd love to know where you're at and if you want to see the full versions of everything 0
512479	I just shared the secret link of the day anything at all links are always in the description down below. 0
516740	Then let's talk about South Africa's President Jacob Zuma who has stepped down this week. 0
520352	To give you some background, 0
521448	he's been in power for nine years out of a 10 year term. Zuma has been a longtime member of the African National Congress 0
526350	Party (ANC) and he is very well known for being charismatic. He's a huge populist 0
530390	He's been very active in almost all aspects of his party from the militant wing in the early 60s 0
534860	which eventually led with him serving on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela all the way to become intelligence chief of the ANC under Mandela. From 0
541190	there, he eventually became the deputy president of South Africa, 0
543590	but then lost the position in 0
545250	2005 after being implicated in a fraud trial. Those fraud charges would end up being dropped in just two weeks after 0
550500	Zuma was elected president in 2009 and so with his nine years, 0
553820	he's actually the longest-serving president in the country so far 0
556130	Now since the end of apartheid, South Africa has only elected ANC members and many have had scandals, 0
560930	but not quite like Zuma. Aside from the 2005 fraud charges, there were a bunch of other charges and allegations. In 2006, 0
567320	he was charged and eventually acquitted of raping a family friend. During his presidency, the state Ombudsman said that 20 million dollars in security upgrades 0
573740	to his home were excessive and obscene. There's also been 0
575910	controversy that his government was essentially paid to play. One of the prominent examples is the Gupta family. They're wealthy Indian immigrants. There, 0
581870	we saw emails link that implicated that the Guptas were actually using Zuma to help them get political appointees and better contracts for their businesses. 0
587960	And actually just this, week police raided their residence, which actually led to concerns that there was more damning evidence 0
592670	that would be popping up soon against Zuma. 0
594620	But actually, one of the biggest things to happen came in October of 2017 0
597600	Because that's actually when the Supreme Court ruled that Zuma would need to face corruption charges because of a sketchy arms deal around two decades 0
603260	ago and from this to see many people in ANC just had enough with Zuma and in fact in November of 2017 they tried to 0
608390	vote him out of office though the president in South Africa is elected more like a prime minister. The parties vote for him into office 0
613370	not the people. Now, that said, Zuma ended up surviving that vote, 0
616130	but just barely. We then saw a rival faction in the ANC push forward Cyril Ramaphosa 0
619920	as the new head of the ANC. Cyril also has a long history with the party. 0
623540	He's actually seen as the real protege of Mandela by many. 0
626220	The ANC gave an ultimatum to Zuma: step down or we are going to vote you out of office and so Wednesday he announced his resignation 0
632370	in a speech saying, "No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name. 0
637460	I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the Republic with immediate effect even though I disagree with the decision of 0
642440	the leadership of my organization, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC. As I leave, 0
646670	I will continue to serve the people of South Africa as well as the ANC, the organisation 0
650510	I have served all my life." And after his resignation, the Parliament broke out into song and dance and seemingly the reaction wasn't just from 0
656960	his opposition. 0
657800	One analyst for the BBC in South Africa saying this: "The resignation of President Jacob Zuma 0
661670	marks the end of an era an era of one corruption allegation after another, an era of divisions, infighting, and public 0
666810	squabbles. There are many people who are 0
668250	celebrating now and not just from the opposition benches. Also, the question of well who will be president now 0
672980	Well if you've been paying attention it should come as no shock - Cyril Ramaphosa. 0
676080	He's already been sworn in and right now things are looking hopeful although South Africa of course has a long road ahead of it 0
682130	But just looking at the reaction in general, 0
683790	it looks like people are 0
685110	celebrating this change and are very hopeful. And for those of you that thought that maybe DACA would be handled this week... 0
690200	Nope! Yesterday, all four immigration bills that have been worked on failed. Chris Coons and John McCain's bill failed 52 to 0
696420	47. Toomey amendment failed 54 to 45. The Susan Collins Chuck Schumer common-sense plan failed fifty four to forty five and the Grassley bill that 0
704060	President Trump tweeted that if Dems were serious about DACA 0
706580	they would vote for was 39 to 60 and the other bills were expected to fail, but the one that had the most 0
711200	hope was the Bipartisan bill the ones with Collins and Schumer things actually looked pretty promising 0
714960	until Trump threatened to veto the bill on Twitter calling it a total catastrophe, 0
718890	saying it's a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders. Now as far as what happens now, 0
723170	I have no idea because so much time has seemingly passed with so many people focusing on this issue and we are 0
730290	nowhere closer to striking a deal and ultimately we're looking at a situation where every solution proposed failed, 0
735930	no one really knows 0
737210	what comes next, everyone's going on a vacation, and DACA recipients have no long-term protection. 0
742490	But ultimately we're just gonna have to wait and see what happens next. That's where we're going to end today's show and remember if you 0
