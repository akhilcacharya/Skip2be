7109	linked below so we're here in the 1
9480	Corsair suite where they are going more 0
12179	tempered glass and more RGB than ever 0
14700	before what a freaking surprise so 0
17190	behind me I've actually got a case that 0
22080	includes no RGB lighting whatsoever 0
24510	this is the Obsidian 500 d and i'm just 0
27510	gonna put it in front of that one for 0
29400	reasons that I will reveal quite shortly 0
31320	this is Corsairs first case with 0
33840	integrated native USB type-c in the 0
36690	front including that 20 pin connector on 0
39210	the inside that is supported on newer 0
41370	motherboards it's got a tempered glass 0
43079	side panel it's got support for two hard 0
45600	drives and three SSDs on the back of the 0
47430	motherboard tray and water cooling 0
49230	support is actually pretty wide open as 0
51870	well it can take up to a triple 120 0
55170	millimeter in the front and a dual 140 0
58410	millimeter in the top and part of that 0
60359	is thanks to its extremely efficient 0
64129	that's fine 0
65580	extremely efficient use of its internal 0
67470	space so it's got a lot of room up here 0
69090	for a big radiator and fins and then 0
72090	it's almost no clearance between the 0
74010	motherboard and the power supply 0
75540	basement down here now this guy's going 0
78479	to be 149 or something along those lines 0
80729	and should be available pretty soon but 0
83640	honestly this isn't the one that I'm not 0
85200	excited about oh yeah there's a 0
86490	removable fan filter I'm not sure how it 0
91229	comes out but no removable fan filter so 0
94650	I'm just gonna put that aside be right 0
96570	back this is the sexy one so this would 0
104790	cost quite a bit more if it were to make 0
107490	it to market 0
108270	it's got curved tempered glass on the 0
111240	front just like the concept slate that 0
114240	we showed off last year slash did a 0
116340	video of quite recently it's showing off 0
118799	the vertical GPU mounting that is also 0
121500	available in its little brother and it 0
124170	is also planned to include Corsairs 0
127049	light loop RGB fans so the plan if it 0
130709	were to become a real product would also 0
132360	be to 0
132860	include a Corsair commander Pro so you 0
135020	can RG be affected up and estimated may 0
138350	be hypothetical pricing somewhere in the 0
140320	250 dollar range and for how good this 0
143660	thing looks it could be the case to beat 0
146690	if you're into mid towers with tempered 0
149120	glass an RGB but let's say you're not 0
151130	into RGB and you want to spend a lot of 0
152630	money course there has a new power 0
154340	supply for you it has been four years 0
156890	since the ax 1500 I and it finally has a 0
161120	big brother although it should be noted 0
162770	it's actually two centimeters shorter 0
164720	this is the ax 1600 I uses gallium 0
169340	nitride MOSFETs in order to achieve its 0
172060	astonishing 94% efficiency at 100% load 0
178040	that is four percent higher than the 80 0
179840	plus titanium spec so the reason Corsair 0
183020	hasn't done a successor to the 1500 I is 0
185390	that anything higher than that would 0
187400	trip a 120 volt North American breaker 0
190280	anyway well they got this thing so 0
192200	efficient that is only pulling seventeen 0
194600	hundred and thirty watts from the wall 0
196310	at a hundred percent load meaning that 0
198590	it won't trip your breaker whew 0
200660	it also comes with coursera link support 0
202880	and my favorite this was actually 0
205790	something that I suggested to course at 0
207650	one point why do you guys just have 0
210140	these stickers that you can't remove I 0
211820	was like can I get a new sticker waiting 0
