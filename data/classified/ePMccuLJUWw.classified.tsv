9960	to tella bear comm slash LTT we're here 1
12389	at Thermaltake checking out their view 0
13980	37 case first thing your to notice other 0
16830	than that it just looks amazing in its 0
18510	current configuration at CES is these 0
20760	huge 200 millimeter fans behind the 0
23490	acrylic in the front of the case this 0
25680	won't come with the case the standard or 0
27689	the upgraded RGB version but you'll be 0
30119	able to add them yourself if you want to 0
32040	have a different configuration than 0
33480	these 200 millimeter fans up in the 0
35399	front you can have up to three 120 0
37500	millimeter fans or two 140 millimeter 0
40050	fans moving inside the case from there 0
42090	you can see this awesome radiator that's 0
43710	mounted on the right hand side you could 0
45570	set up this current configuration with 0
47430	three 120 millimeter fans or go down to 0
49950	two or one and then in the back there's 0
52320	a 140 millimeter fan placed there 0
54329	currently that should come with both 0
56219	versions of the case that you could buy 0
57719	but it would be a different fan than the 0
59489	one that's currently in here but you 0
60989	could tone that down to 120 if you 0
63239	wanted in terms of where all these crazy 0
65129	fans are gonna actually breathe from 0
66960	because you see this huge acrylic panel 0
68939	on the front and this nice curved 0
70680	acrylic panel on the side the front ones 0
73020	will breathe in through the side there's 0
74400	grills along there they're fairly large 0
76439	that won't give them the most amount of 0
78090	airflow but it is a huge amount of fans 0
80610	that you can mount there so it should 0
81659	breathe pretty okay and this radiator 0
84000	placement just on the inside of the case 0
85500	should be able to breathe super easily 0
87210	as it has its own cutout in the back so 0
90030	the huge fans in the front are able to 0
91860	feed both the back fan and the radiator 0
94470	fans that are just mounted on the inside 0
95970	and just in front of the power supply if 0
98400	you do go with the vertical GPU mount 0
100320	you can see here in this current 0
101880	configuration that they have the pump 0
103500	and the reservoir mounted very nicely 0
105240	right behind there so you can have a 0
106770	whole bunch of really tight nice water 0
109110	cooling setups like they have with their 0

114899	they have two USB 3 ports two USB to 0
117540	ports headphone and microphone jacks a 0
119640	power button and an activity LED so if 0
122640	you think that setup looked great and 0
124229	you want to emulate something like that 0
125670	or do something in another case whatever 0
127530	brand it may be you could pick up one of 0
129780	their water 0
130690	Kitt's if you're worried about doing 0
132490	water cooling if maybe it's your first 0
133810	time and you want everything handled for 0
135700	you you can pick up anything in their 0
137500	range right here they have an m240 which 0
139810	is a 240 millimeter rad and it's more a 0
142390	little bit simple compared to the other 0
144130	ones there's no crazy RGB or anything 0
146380	going on there you can move up to an M 0
148540	360 which has more RGB going on it's a 0
151330	360 radiator it's a little bit more 0

171370	situation you're gonna have it will all 0
172990	be taken care of for you and a hard line 0

176800	some people to get into so this setup 0
179170	will help you get started in that scary 0
181720	arena of water cooling at all and the 0
183580	advanced difficulty of hardline and more 0

187450	clear liquid but if you want to change 0
