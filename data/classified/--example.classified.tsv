1740	Hope you're having a fantastic 0
2649	Tuesday, Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it. 0
6260	And the first thing I want to talk about today because 0
8249	there's so much negativity in the news is a 0
10500	Positive story 0
12520	a positive story about my new personal hero Elizabeth Swaney. 0
14420	Elizabeth Swaney's a 33 year old American woman. 0
16949	She's been freestyle skiing since 2013. She's had the goal of making the Olympics. 0
21140	And this year she did just that, she went to the Olympics 0
23279	but you may not have heard of her because she finished 0
25210	24th (last place).  This in the women's ski halfpipe 0
28480	And as far as why she ended up in last place 0
29730	It was because she really didn't attempt any tricks. 0
32430	I can't show you the video for legal reasons 0
33989	but when she would get to the top of the halfpipe where people would normally do a trick she would just then go back down. 0
39750	For her two runs she receive the scores 30 and 31.4. 0
42570	I laughed because her best score was still 13.6 points behind 23rd place 0
47040	And that was Denmark's Laila Friis-Salling 0
49520	and she slipped on both runs. So the question becomes well 0
51560	Why did Elizabeth Swaney not do any tricks and how the hell is she in the Olympics?? Well my friends it is because Elizabeth 0
57220	Swaney is a damn American hero. A woman with the very American mindset of "It doesn't matter if I'm qualified to do it 0
64660	I'm gonna figure out a way how to get there!" Elizabeth knowing she didn't have a good chance of competing with the US team originally 0
69540	Competed for Venezuela where her mother is from later switching to Hungary where her grandparents were from. 0
73980	She actually ended up becoming Hungary's first 0
75600	Olympic freestyle skier after qualifying both through the country's quota system as well as placing where she needed to place 0
80439	among 13 World Cup halfpipe contests. 0
82302	Now when you hear that she placed where she needed to place you go, oh okay, 0
85979	Well, she beat out other athletes. Not really, pretty much every event she went to she placed last or near last. 0
91170	But Elizabeth realized she could game the system. According to the rules, to qualify for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games 0
96040	athletes must record a number of top 30 finishes. 0
98610	And so what Swaney ended up doing was just going to competitions with fewer than 30 competitors! 0
103470	And so by technicality she was satisfying the requirements. 0
