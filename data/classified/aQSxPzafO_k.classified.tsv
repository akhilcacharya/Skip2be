5620	 Here's an interesting question: Paris, France and New York, USA 0
10040	 Which city do you think the population is more dense? 0
11740	 The answer may seem obvious: New York, skyscraper kingdom, Big Apple ... right? 0
19340	 error. 0
20630	 In fact, New York's population density is less than half that of Paris. 0
24890	 Paris lives 56,000 people per square mile (22,000 per square kilometer) 0
29660	 New York City, with only 27,000 people per square mile (10500 square kilometers per square kilometer) 0
33010	 To find a comparable European city with New York (the most densely populated city in the United States) 0
37790	 You have to see the sixth in Europe: Lyon, France 0
43110	 (27 000 per square meter / mile; 10500 per square kilometer.) 0
44110	 Of course, New York has a super dense metropolitan core, but it is surrounded by an endless stretch of suburbs, 0
48989	 Just like almost any other American city. 0
52500	 On the other hand, virtually all of Paris's population is concentrated in the center of a compact city 0
58050	 There is another interesting pattern between the two continents: 0
62201	 In the United States, the affluent lives in cities, while affluent Europeans live in the city center. 0
67549	 Compare the income maps for Paris and Philadelphia. 0
70539	 Of course, this is a bit rough, but you can really see such a pattern, 0
74240	 The most commonly cited reason for these two different trends is the difference in urban age. 0
78299	 Most European cities have existed for hundreds or even thousands of years, 0
83311	 While some American cities have reached the size of what can be called the city's population, 0
88490	 However, the past one or two hundred years. 0
90219	 This also means that in those times when the super-rich must commute by foot, 0
94610	 European cities already exist. 0
95920	 In the Middle Ages, Paris had between 20 and 300,000 people, 0
101280	 But you can still walk from one end of the city to the other within 30 minutes, 0
104679	 The population is incredibly dense. 0
107409	 At that time, people must live within walking distance, 0
110429	 Therefore, the rich pay more to live closer to the city center, 0
114939	 A similar reason may explain why the historic European hotel 0
119729	 The best, largest rooms you will often see are usually on the lower floors, as opposed to what you see today. 0
124359	 Before the elevator was invented, the wealthy did not want to climb so many stairs on foot. 0
128419	 Before the elevator was invented, the rich do not want to walk, climb so many stairs. 0
129758	 Walking distance is not only important in big cities, 0
132730	 Small villages in Europe are almost always the same size, 0
138230	 This is because their population is determined by the extent to which their surroundings can be reached by foot 0
142060	 European farmers tend to live in small towns and walk to their fields for work, 0
146690	 This is different from the situation in which American peasants generally hold a manor. 0
149569	 So here's the village 0
153269	 It will only be as large as people can walk to the field only by foot. 0
156299	 On the other hand, in the more modern era, the decentralized technology has become more advanced, 0
160690	 American cities have also started their rapid growth period. 0
165650	 As North American cities become larger and larger than people can walk, 0
169629	 There is already enough technology to build a public transport system. 0
173780	 There is already enough technology to build a public transport system. 0
174980	 The first major public transport innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century. 0
180379	 This is a very expensive mode of transportation, so only the super rich can use it. 0
186190	 Interestingly, because the steam train takes a long time to accelerate, 0
190900	 As a commune for the rich people to use the town, which is called the suburbs of the railway, 0
195219	 It is not usually the nearest village, but a few miles from the city. 0
200970	 The impact of the suburbs of the railway still exists today, 0
203860	 In the old Philadelphia Railway, there is a rich community extension. 0
208079	 From Ardmore to Malvern, there are huge manor and country clubs. 0
211769	 There has been no change in the demographics since the suburbs of the railway. 0
216020	 Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States. 0
221560	 Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States. 0
222670	 Like steam trains, trams also create new communities 0
227020	 This time there is not much money for the upper middle class. 0
230030	 In the affluent suburbs of Washington, DC, Tenley town, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville 0
235379	 Are formed with the tram appeared. 0
238920	 But again, walking distance affects geography, 0
243530	 Tramcar commuters have to live within walking distance of tram stops, 0
247890	 So people naturally focus on walking to the tram station takes 20 to thirty minutes away, 0
253189	 Exceed this range ...... Nothing at all 0
255579	 This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute. 0
259709	 This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute. 0
260709	 Then the car debut. 0
262710	 At first, cars were used only by the upper classes, especially when the United States was also distracted by the two wars and the Great Depression 0
266950	 However, the young Americans later returned from the battlefields of World War II, 0
271920	 At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford. 0
276180	 At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford. 0
278340	 By 1950, more than 50% of families owned cars. 0
281940	 In the meantime, the government provided loans to veterans, 0
286290	 This has significantly increased the population that the United States can afford to buy. 0
290280	 Instead of buying a small downtown real estate, this generation chose to use their new car commute 0
295080	 In order to live in the suburbs, cheaper and better bigger house. 0
299080	 The idea was that working parents would go to urban areas every day, 0
302780	 The rest of the family will stay to enjoy the suburbs. 0
305361	 This is the perfect deal. 0
307090	 Although this whole history is absolutely true, it does not fully explain why 0
312410	 European cities do not experience suburbanization. 0
315160	 In Germany, many can even say most cities 0
320440	 In World War II was bombed into ruins, 0
321440	 They have the opportunity to rebuild their community in any way, 0
326440	 But they chose to maintain a high density design. 0
327800	 At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States. 0
333230	 At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States. 0
334300	 In the meantime, other European cities survived the war, 0
338960	 Mass influx, but still maintain a huge population density. 0
344380	 Crime may be the least cited reason for suburbanization in the United States. 0
348790	 We sometimes forget, but this is a somewhat uglier period in American history 0
353551	 The crime rate was crazy in the 70s, 80s and 90s. 0
358030	 There are innumerable different theories to explain this, but perhaps the most interesting one is 0
362020	 Higher leaded car exhaust contributes to lower IQ and higher aggression. 0
368240	 In 1990, New York reached as many as 2,245 astronomical murders, 0
374780	 London did not have as much in the entire 1990s. 0
378710	 In the United States, the rate of violent crime continues to be ten times higher than in Britain. 0
384770	 In 1992, a poll asked people moving out of New York why they were moving to the suburbs. 0
390660	 The most common reason cited is "crime", reaching 47%. 0
395240	 "Cost and quality of life" is as low as 10%. 0
400550	 Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people. 0
405370	 Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people. 0
406940	 Europeans do not need to worry too much about such crimes in cities, 0
410660	 So they are more willing to live in the city center. 0
412900	 The land on the American suburbs is also more readily available, 0
417280	 Because farmers are always quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers. 0
421800	 In contrast, France's agricultural subsidies per acre 0
427680	 12 times higher than the United States. 0
428780	 This is one of the big reasons why a large number of European cities are still surrounded by small farms. 0
434830	 In many European cities, you can really take the city bus to the farm. 0
439580	 In the end, all kinds of energy are cheaper in the United States. 0
443340	 And in some European countries, a gallon of gasoline sold for $ 7, 0
449600	 The United States on average only $ 2.20. 0
451120	 It is significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe, so Europeans have a higher incentive to live closer to the office, 0
457150	 Well, driving a short time, you can take the public transport. 0
462280	 In addition, in Europe, electricity and heating costs are higher 0
467560	 Large suburban homes are usually not attractive. 0
469620	 However, suburban life did not meet everyone's expectations. 0
472700	 Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains. 0
478790	 Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains. 0
481100	 This is 2.5% of their entire life. 0
484220	 Science has also proven that commuting from the suburbs and higher blood pressure, 0
489380	 Lower frustration tolerance, and higher odds of anxiety. 0
494780	 In addition, the suburbs are no longer used to be country shelters, 0
498740	 They are just an extension of a city. 0
501950	 As a result, wealthy Americans began to return to cities, 0
505800	 With lower crime rates, rising fuel costs and changing perceptions, 0
510870	 The core of the city is ushering in revival. 0
512309	 This is why we live in our present place. 0
515510	 This is a complex, controversial, and surprising political history. 0
