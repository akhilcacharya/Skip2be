60	today we're going to talk about space 0
2100	walk so back in the old days property 0
9150	owners had the rights to their land 0
10320	going up forever and ever 0
12450	in perpetuity but then the airplane came 0
15089	around and smart people realized it you 0
17190	couldn't just go around asking every 0
18900	property owner for permission to fly 0
20699	through their airspace so government 0
23070	societ they would own the air above a 0
25080	certain level in general government 0
27599	decided that property owners owned their 0
29640	land up to 500 feet above ground level 0
31980	and then the air above that going up 0
34260	infinitely was to be owned and 0
36270	controlled by the government 0
37620	this made life easier for airplanes but 0
40230	then America invented space and that 0
42030	made things a little more complicated in 0
44430	most cases satellites and spacecraft 0
46170	orbit around the earth so it would be a 0
48270	logistical nightmare to request 0
49950	permission to enter into the airspace of 0
51750	each nation in an orbit once again smart 0
55079	people got together and decided that 0
56489	those air rights that countries had 0
58140	given themselves should end at a certain 0
59699	level different countries say different 0
62579	things but all of them agree that 0
64199	somewhere between 19 miles above earth 0
66119	the altitude of the highest airplanes 0
67950	and balloons and 99 miles above earth 0
70380	the altitude of the lowest orbiting 0
72240	satellites a country's claim to 0
73950	sovereignty stops so this begs the 0
76710	question which laws apply in space so 0
80520	let's say an astronaut commits a small 0
82350	crime all in space like I don't know 0
84600	doing a line want a spacecraft this 0
87630	isn't a huge crime against humanity but 0
89759	they're gonna have to be punished if the 0
91890	astronaut had those happy times on the 0
93689	spacecraft of a specific country it 0
95610	would be clear which country would 0
96990	prosecute if it wasn't a Soyuz capsule 0
99930	Russia would prosecute if it was in a 0
101880	SpaceX capsule the US would prosecute 0
104329	much like with boats the spacecraft is 0
106950	considered to be an extension of the 0
108720	sovereignty of that country but let's 0
111390	say mr. astronaut did his line while on 0
113159	the moon who would prosecute then the 0
115740	Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that no 0
118619	country can claim a section of space or 0
120930	a celestial body as their territory so 0
123570	this means that no country's laws apply 0
125520	universally on the moon well this is 0
128250	where the idea of extraterritorial 0
130080	jurisdiction comes into play in almost 0
132989	every kind 0
133870	citizens are subject to the laws of 0
136150	their own country even if they are 0
137890	outside of the country this doesn't 0
140560	apply when they are in other countries 0
142450	and see other countries laws Trump the 0
144819	extraterritorial jurisdiction but when 0
147129	they aren't in any country these laws do 0
149349	apply this means that two people in the 0
152110	exact same place can be subject to 0
154120	different laws an 18 year old british 0
157030	astronaut could technically drink on the 0
158830	moon one 18 year old american astronaut 0
161080	could not just to make things a little 0
163840	bit more complicated the rules are 0
165640	different on the International Space 0
167319	Station this Space Station agreement the 0
170440	document that outlines the rules of the 0
172360	ISS says that in most cases 0
174959	extraterritorial jurisdiction applies 0
176950	each astronaut is subject to the laws of 0
179650	their own country however if for example 0
182769	an American astronaut say punches a 0
185349	french one out of frustration France 0
187360	will be allowed to prosecute American 0
189310	astronaut the same rule applies with 0
191950	property if a British astronaut smashes 0
194410	a Canadian astronauts computer Canada 0
196540	could prosecute the Brit in addition 0
199329	this agreement allows for the 0
200889	extradition of astronauts in all cases 0
203049	regardless if the two countries have a 0
205060	normal extradition treaty this is 0
207519	actually pretty important because Russia 0
209590	doesn't have an extradition treaty with 0
211329	the US this means that Russia doesn't 0
213639	have to give up individuals who have 0
215349	committed a crime in which the US has 0
217060	the right to prosecute in the case that 0
219730	a Russian commits a crime against an 0
221500	American on the ISS however Russia would 0
224230	be obliged to extradite that astronaut 0
226650	another situation and look at is what 0
229510	would happen if a baby was born in space 0
231599	first off this is a super hypothetical 0
234579	because it's unknown if it's even 0
235989	possible for a baby to be born in 0
237849	zero-gravity and if they were their 0
240639	bones would be so brittle that they 0
242049	would crush under their own weight if 0
243849	they return to gravity it's unlikely 0
246130	that any country would allow for an 0
247870	astronaut to have a baby in space 0
249400	because that would be like super 0
251260	unethical but for the sake of argument 0
253900	let's say there was a space baby 0
255970	what nationality would that baby be 0
257918	there is actually precedent for this 0
260349	question thirteen babies have been born 0
262810	in Antarctica where there's a similar 0
265000	treaty that disallows sovereignty 0
267340	while those babies were not born in 0
269200	their parents countries they took their 0
271030	parents nationalities the same policy 0
273639	applies in space there are countries 0
276280	however that don't give citizenship to 0
278680	babies born outside of the country so in 0
281200	that case the baby would take the 0
282880	citizenship of the country of the 0
284410	spacecraft they were born in this is the 0
286900	same rule that applies when a baby is 0
288639	born on an airplane in flight they take 0
291160	the nationality of their parents and if 0
293260	that's not possible 0
294400	they take the nationality of the country 0
296050	in which the aircraft is registered and 0
297790	what happens that the baby is born on 0
300190	the Moon or Mars where there is no 0
301840	sovereignty well I don't know man what 0
304510	do I look like a lawyer but seriously 0
306910	nobody really knows this is just one of 0
310240	many flaws in current space law only 536 0
314800	people have been to space and all of 0
316660	them were highly trained and were 0
318100	representing their country they just 0
320290	aren't the type of people to commit 0
321940	crimes as commercial spaceflight and 0
325210	space tourism develop all these laws 0
327790	will need to be made more clear to 0
329530	prevent future problems gone is the era 0
332560	when these laws can just be figured out 0
334450	when and if the time comes in the near 0
337330	future we could be seeing space mining 0
339490	as well and that will require economic 0
341680	laws and environmental treaties the 0
344890	coming decades will be a fascinating 0
346720	time as we watch not only the 0
348400	development of commercial space 0
349780	industries but also as we lay out the 0
351910	legal and political groundwork needed 0
354190	for the opening of the final frontier 0
360460	following the bombing of Pan Am flight 0
362780	103 over Scotland a deal with reach 0
365330	between Gaddafi of Libya and the British 0
367490	government in which the trial of the 0
369259	accused bombers would happen in a 0
370910	neutral country in return the 0
372979	extradition 0
