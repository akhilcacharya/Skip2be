0	 Peace be upon you, I'm Dustin, and welcome to "Every day smarter" 0
2760	 I have just interviewed the President of the United States of America 0
6380	 It really is strange to me because I'm not a journalist 0
8380	 I'm not a politician, I'm a rocket engineer 0
11400	 I will, however, take a different view from the rest of the people 0
14660	 The interview with the president is something different because you learn a lot about it 0
18180	 The White House is also definitely, but you learn things about yourself as well 0
21140	 The video will contain 4 paragraphs 0
22660	 1. How it happened. 2. What were my goals from this interview 0
24600	 3. The interview is complete. 4. And what is declared of it. 0
27460	 What I understood is that there were many candidates to meet the president 0
29700	 At one point, it became one of the candidates most likely to do so 0
32159	 I did not register on the basis of liberal or democratic, and the question was asked: for the benefit of the voice 0
36400	 And I did not answer 0
37920	 But the way I answered it made it clear to me 0
40700	 I will not be selected for the interview 0
42860	 And it happened the opposite and I chose 0
44080	 It was a secret for 3 weeks and then went to Los Angeles to film an interview. 0
47320	 There she met Adnold and Ingrid 0
49720	 They were very fun and humble too 0
51720	 When I returned home I asked suggestions about the questions I should ask on the Internet 0
54840	 I received all kinds of answers 0
57060	 I mean good and bad too. It was fun 0
59020	 But think about it, I do not agree with the president on all issues 0
62180	 So I learned it was a great opportunity in front of me 0
63760	 I was able to sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how to run the country in my view 0
68920	 Or I would accept that he sees things differently than I think 0
73600	 And to try a deep, intelligent and respectful interview. 0
76900	 My goal was not only a smart and respectable interview 0
80140	 With someone I may not share my opinion on some topics 0
82420	 But I was hoping to prove that it would be fun. 0
84640	 For that, I went to Washington where I met the president. 0
87220	 Yesterday the meeting, we went to the studio 0
89360	 In Maryland, we trained on it with Frederic 0
91840	 He's a Google employee, a very funny man. 0
94780	 The next day, we went to the White House and we met a dog president 0
97620	 Which was in fact very soft. 0
99760	 We have settings and make sure we move correctly what we need 0
102740	 Each of us went to a corner to review the questions for the last time 0
105960	 To make sure we adjust what we say. 0
107960	 Then the President waited for us to come and we started the interview 0
111060	 The president had told us who we were 0
113520	 Susie would give him a light about the interview, 0
115680	 And then I was watching him with a video 0
117460	 Then Ingrid would ask him what was in his pocket. 0
119740	 Many people wanted to know, once I read these, cards 0
122380	 In the White House, these cards are available, before the interview. 0
125040	 The answer is: no. 0
126300	 What I did is 0
127280	 I looked him in the eye all the time 0
130460	 This was evident, through his physical expression 0
132460	 That makes him comfortable 0
134340	 That impressed me. When I was aware of it 0
136540	 I said to myself: Yahah, a citizen who came back to the White House 0
140700	 In an interview with the world's most powerful man, 0
142560	 In an interview on live broadcast 0
145360	 This is very transparent. 0
147560	 I do not care what you say about the man's policy, 0
150020	 But that impressed me, and I liked it a lot. 0
152720	 For several reasons, I was not nervous, really 0
154780	 I was so excited about it. 0
156140	 I decided to ask questions first 0
157860	 On how to develop his intelligence in areas that may not be his specialty. 0
160680	 The answer was important, because it is clear 0
162680	 Has changed its means throughout the presidency. 0
165420	 While he was answering, it was clear to me that he was in a traditional position to meet 0
168660	 His body was untouchable 0
170660	 Remember that until now the president is not aware of the quality of the interrogators I am. 0
175280	 For information, I could have been tough. 0
176980	 What happened next is something I will never forget 0
179840	 I learned that we were on the same wave, 0
182920	 I really wanted to make it clear to him, 0
184620	 He listened to him for 10 hours through recorded books. 0
187520	 Note the face of the President, 0
189520	 You will see the moment when we were contacted. 0
192360	 Opama: I think it's compatible with, 0
194720	 You are aware of this, the approach of scientists to address problems in general. 0
197220	 Destin: Actually I've listened to your recorded books 0
200180	 And in "my father's dreams," 0
202340	 He concluded by addressing the National Democratic Convention of 2004. 0
206080	 Did you see that? Let's go back and take a look at the language of his body. 0
208860	 He was discreet, and then the call happened. 0
211340	 Is not that great? 0
212400	 It was the moment when she was really interviewed 0
214920	 It became fun and smart 0
217860	 Between two people who want each one for the better one. 0
220060	 It was a wonderful moment, and I will never forget it. 0
222380	 My second question was about polarization. 0
224740	 It was clear to me that the country knows two poles very much about what it was before, 0
228920	 In fact, there are data to make sure. 0
231280	 Whatever your point of view, it has become very common to make fun of 0
233980	 From the other side and to blame him for all the country's problems. 0
237400	 The president explained why this is growing. 0
240020	 Obama: The problem is that, when we return to our policy, 0
244220	 Whatever the reason, 0
246580	 This is largely related, as you know, to the media 0
252460	 Some people only watch Fox News 0
254880	 Others do not, only read the New York Times, 0
256880	 And so they are not starting from the common points between them. 0
260100	 They take two positions in their view of the world only. 0
263460	 Dastin: In the field of theoretical enmity, there are so-called "magnifying results" 0
266920	 There is what is positive and what is negative views. 0
269660	 If you remove the negative from any two systems, the discrimination will occur and create chaos. 0
275040	 This is not the science of politics, this of mathematics. 0
277780	 When people listen, from right or left, to the media that pleases them only 0
281860	 This is dangerous. 0
283620	 There are no negative responses that bring you back to the moderate middle, and this will lead to extremism. 0
288980	 I liked what the President said on this point, 0
291040	 Because it is the responsibility of each of the parties in the political dialogue 0
295360	 To listen to the arguments of the other. 0
297520	 Otherwise, you will be in the echo room, and you will only hear those sounds 0
301020	 That inflated, what, you want to hear, and then a little will only remain a controversy. 0
305020	 My third question was about space, where the president shook hands, 0
308420	 I forgot to be a respected and respected gentleman. 0
311040	 On the whole, you can see in my face how excited you are to this question 0
313820	 I would like the viewer to listen to the President's answer. 0
316100	 I wanted to end this with a funny observation, so I asked him this interesting question from Reddit: 0
319560	 Destin: If there is something to be called after you, opium 0
324020	 I hope that this is the first time that you have been asked this question. 0
325680	 OBAMA: I never got that question. 0
326500	 Destin: Excellent 0
327500	 the question is: 0
328400	 Obama: This is the first time. 0
329740	 Destin: So what do you want this tool to be 0
331940	 Obama: What is the tool ..... What will be .... 0
334820	 Destin: The tool is an opium. 0
336820	 OBAMA: The question is, what will be the affairs of Obama? 0
338820	 Destin: That's true 0
339900	 Obama: That's important 0
340980	 Dosten: I will not show all his answers now, and I encourage you to see the whole interview 0
343740	 You will find it full in the White House Channel. White's House Channel. 0
346060	 It is time to talk about what you have learned from this experience. 0
347600	 The exercise of thinking about questions to ask the most powerful man in the world 0
351980	 It's different from being at home or chatting with your friends 0
355980	 And planning to go and sit, and look into his eyes 0
360060	 And ask questions. 0
361440	 I united myself I would like to know more, 0
363260	 More mutual and more compassionate. 0
365700	 Why? Why do we tend to be disrespectful? 0
369300	 These two things are what I have learned from the president's interview on how to communicate with people 0
372980	 May differ from them. 0
374740	 No. 1. If you write or chat with someone in your phone, 0
378240	 I will say that I sit with that person, and look at them in the right, 0
382360	 Because I want to be respectful and tolerant. 0
384940	 # 2: If you can listen, that's great! 0
388800	 Think about it, if I listen, not just ride my answer to show that I'm smart, 0
393100	 But if he really listened to contact with them from heart to heart, 0
396340	 My credibility and the extent of my influence on that person will increase! 0
400320	 Even if he was the most powerful man in the world, think about it. 0
405600	 Respect and listen. 0
407880	 It's really simple. 0
409260	 But that is very hard. 0
411460	 And thank you, it went from the rockets, 0
414660	 To the President's interview .... This is really crazy! 0
417260	 In any case, if this is the first episode you see on the channel every day smarter 0
420660	 For some reason, you feel comfortable joining the channel, do so, 0
424060	 But only if you think it's worth it! 0
425240	 Another scoundrel, I thank the fans who supported me from the start 0
428720	 To date, this is awesome and is Audible.com 1
432460	 So I prepared for this interview, 1
434460	 I shot some shots from the White House to tell you what I learned. 1
437840	 I hope you enjoyed my experience at the White House. 1
441400	 If you are interested in listening to President Barack Obama's books, 1
444600	 The first is "Dad Dreams", you can get free sermons on Audible.com/smarter 1
449540	 And I really advise you this book, it is an excellent reader, 1
453160	 Fabulous. Another book, "The Audacity to Hope" 1
456400	 You have full freedom to check out these books, and I suspect it is, important to you 1
459360	 Be aware of the ideas of the country. 1
462480	 On the whole, I would like you to pass on Audible.com/smarter 1
465480	 "The audacity on the amps" and "My father's dreams." 1
