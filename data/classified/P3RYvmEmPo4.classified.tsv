0	'Sup, You beautiful bastards, hope you're havin' a fantastic Friday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and if you're new here on Fridays 0
6120	we do things a little bit different. 0
7170	I try to cover more viewer requested stories, stories that I wanted to cover this week 0
10640	but then because of the sake of time we didn't get to film it. So with that said, let's just jump into it. 0
14620	And the first thing we're going to talk about today is something that I feel proves that we are in one of the weirder 0
19160	timelines and that is because we are getting news about the White House from a reality TV show called 0
24660	Celebrity Big Brother. And this situation revolves around our Omarosa Manigault-Newman. 0
28520	Most who know about her call her Omarosa, she was on The Apprentice several times which of course was Donald Trump's reality show. 0
33980	Then, during the election, she was involved with Donald Trump again. 0
36800	During the RNC she said she had been named director of African-American outreach for their campaign 0
40880	In December of 2016, she was named as one of nine people on Donald Trump's transition team. 0
45220	Then in early 2017, she was brought on to be part of Trump's White House staff. 0
48240	And her specific title ended up being assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of public liaison. 0
53160	But that was then and this is now and we're living in a post Omarosa White House. 0
57260	In December of last year it was announced that she was "resigning". There are a lot of reports that said otherwise but sure. 0
62370	And now we are in February and Omarosa has now come back to reality TV, but this time on Celebrity Big Brother. 0
68400	It's the first time they're doing it in the States and Omarosa has already made national headlines. 0
72840	So if you're not familiar with the show consider yourself lucky. I am for some reason addicted to Big Brother. 0
77490	I don't know why. I don't care about these people once the show is over. 0
80250	I mean they're watching the live feeds most season for some reason. And whoever's in the house is being filmed at all times. 0
84960	There's cameras everywhere. And so this conversation between Omarosa and Ross Matthews gets filmed and Big Brother then just puts it out. 0
91400	He's talking about her time at the White House and she says this, 0
93560	" 'I felt like it was like a call to duty, I felt like I was serving my country, not serving him. 0
98940	Whenever was it-- I'm accepting a political appointment, it was always about the country. 0
106020	Like I was haunted by tweets every single day, like what does he go to tweet next.' 0
110920	'Does anybody say to him, 0
112549	what are you doing?' 0
114380	'And I tried to be that person and then all the people around him attacked me. It was like 'keep her away from him, 0
121040	don't give her access, don't let her talk to him'. 0
123920	It's not my circus, not my monkeys. 0
125940	You know I'd like to say about my problem, but I can't say that because 0
131490	like it's bad.' 0
137970	'Should we be worried?' 0
143460	'Don't say that...' 0
146000	'Cuz we are worried, but I need you to say no it's gonna be okay.' 'No. It's gonna not be okay' 0
151080	'It's not.' 0
159060	'It's so bad.' " 0
159920	And so there were two main reactions to this; 0
161380	one being 'Holy shit, this is terrifying!' 0
164140	and the other being 'This is just Omarosa putting on a show. She's angry at the White House for kicking her out. 0
168440	She wants people to buy her book. This, this is just a show.' 0
171660	Then in response to this and a question about the White House's reaction 0
174760	to what Omarosa said, deputy press secretary Raj Shah said this, 0
178520	"What is the White House's reaction to comments made by former White House aide Omarosa on Celebrity Big Brother where she said quote 0
184860	'She is haunted by the president's tweets'. She described the situation inside the White House as bad and said it is not going to be okay 0
193500	Not very seriously. Omarosa was fired three times on The Apprentice, and this is the fourth time we let her go 0
200880	She had limited contact with the president while here. She has no contact now." 0
204820	So, one they're dismissing what she's saying 0
206880	and two, now they're being very straightforward and saying that she was fired. 0
209540	And as far as where the situation is right now because she doesn't have 0
212300	documentation, the people that want to believe it are gonna believe it, the people they don't want to believe it, they're not going to. 0
216380	And my personal reaction to this is I don't know what to believe because the source of this 0
219610	information the source of this story is Omarosa. She's a reality TV star veteran that knows how to use the platform, 0
224850	she knew that there were cameras on, her first jump was to go back into reality television 0
229049	where cameras were on at all points where she could whisper things that she wanted to get attention. 0
233760	So this kind of news coming out in a whisper conversation, that's going to have a big impact. 0
238020	Promo and strategy aside, that doesn't mean necessarily that she's lying about what's coming out of her mouth. 0
242680	Now does that guarantee that everything coming in our mouth is a lie, no 0
245240	but it does make me skeptical. But I will say it is kind of funny that she's putting herself in this position now 0
250300	considering what she said back in 2016 which if you do not remember. I shall read. 0
253840	"It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get into the White House, we know where we stand." 0
258820	She then alluded to there being a list of enemies adding, 0
261160	"Every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump." 0
264680	"It's everyone who has ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him." 0
268380	"It's the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe." 0
271380	But with that said I do want to pass the question off to you 0
274050	What is your takeaway from this whole situation? Lying, telling the truth? 0
278160	I'd love to know your thoughts. 0
279680	But that also wasn't the only story about White House staffers we had in today's news because there was Rob Porter. 0
284460	Rob Porter is an, as of this week, former senior White House staffer. Specifically he was the White House staff secretary 0
290220	which meant that he was essentially the gatekeeper for the papers on their way to the president. 0
293400	And porter became an international story this week because his first and second ex-wives came out with stories that he abused them. 0
299280	The first article we saw was from his second ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby. 0
302300	And interestingly enough before describing the abuse that she received she says, 0
306540	"I want to be very clear when I say this." 0
307700	"I don't want to be married to him. I would not recommend anyone to date him or marry him." 0
311600	"But I definitely want him in the White House in the position he is in." 0
314400	"I think his integrity and ability to do his job is impeccable." 0
317120	"And the majority of the issues he suffers from are very personal and intimate." 0
319840	But then she goes on to describe his extreme anger, how he was verbally and emotionally abusive. 0
324760	Then describing Porter getting more violent. Things aren't working, they get separated. 0
328820	She says he violated the terms of their separation, she files for a protective order against him. 0
333320	There was an instance where he punched through a glass door. 0
336260	In December of 2010, she says Porter assaulted her saying it happened. Just after our first anniversary 0
340369	I cannot remember what the fight was about but I excused myself from the fight in a way that was typical at that time I 0
344959	Certainly was not meek and mild and said I'm not going to fight you anymore and stormed off and went to take a shower he 0
349579	Was not done fighting with me. It was a glass shower door 0
351799	He opened it and dragged me by my shoulders out of the shower to yell immediately upon seeing my reaction to that he released me 0
356959	and apologized 0
358099	But it doesn't take away that he was angry enough that that 0
360389	Happened also Porter's first wife in this article is asked for comment 0
363949	She says it was verbally emotionally and physically abusive and that is why I left now following this we see senator Orrin Hatch 0
370049	General Kelly's Sarah Huckabee Sanders all speak up for port all supporting him Kelly saying order is a man of true integrity and honor and 0
377149	I can't say enough good things about him. He's a friend a confidant a trusted professional 0
380789	I am proud to serve alongside Sanders Hank Porter is someone of the highest integrity and exemplary character 0
385789	Orrin Hatch who Porter had worked for as chief of staff 0
388399	Saying it's incredibly discouraging to see such a vile attack on such a decent man shame on any 0
392429	Publication that would print this and shame on the politically motivated morally bankrupt character assassins that would attempt to sully a man's good name 0
398239	I've known him for years both as a close friend and as a personal adviser 0
401389	He is kind and considerate towards all the country needs more honest principled people like Rob Porter 0
406039	Which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails 0
409429	And then the other story comes out remember 0
412159	I said that he had a first wife Hobie Holderness gave that small statement for the first article and then 0
417479	separately shared her story 0
418739	She says he was never physical with me while we were dating and now I see there were red flags left and right she talks 0
423860	about him being verbally abusive, emotionally 0
426210	abusive and saying after their marriage in 0
428520	2003 things escalated. 0
429390	The first incident was during their honeymoon when Porter allegedly kicked her because quotes weren't having sex when he wanted to have sex 0
435840	Adding that was the first time he hurt me and then the doors open 0
438560	I didn't do anything and it continued and then Holderness describes an escalation in the violence 0
443310	Pushing, digging an elbow into her, then it escalated to choking her 0
446900	She says it was not hard enough for me to pass out 0
448910	but it was scary humiliating and dehumanizing. 0
450930	Holderness then describes an incident in Italy where Porter punched her in the face saying we were arguing and he punched me in the 0
456770	Face he left visible marks when he punched me and I have pictures of that 0
459680	I didn't go to the police because I was scared I was in Italy alone 0
462260	And I didn't know what to do now following all this Porter resigned from his position at the White House and said in a statement 0
467240	These outrageous allegations are simply false 0
469400	I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago 0
472100	And the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described 0
475010	I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign 0
480710	We also received new quotes from the previously mentioned three who defended him Sanders saying 0
484850	It's not a matter of believe or don't believe I heard for anyone who's experienced anything like that 0
488330	I haven't in whatever degree 0
489740	But at the same time I can only talk about my personal experience and interaction Kelley's saying I was shocked by the new allegations 0
494820	Released today against Rob Porter. There's no place for domestic violence in our society 0
498650	I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff relieve every individual deserves 0
503990	The right to defend the reputation senator hatch saying I am heartbroken by today's allegation in every interaction. I've had with Rob 0
509540	He has been courteous professional and respectful my staff loved him and he was a trusted advisor 0
513289	I do not know the details of Rob's personal life domestic violence in any form is important and unacceptable 0
518000	I am praying for Rob and those involved and in the press briefing yesterday deputy press secretary Raj 0
522140	Shah said we all could have done better over the last few hours or last few days and dealing with this situation now what I 0
527090	Will say is the most 0
528060	Interesting response that we've seen here is probably the one from General Kelly the reason I say that is because according to reports 0
534260	It's very likely that he already knew about these allegations 0
537150	According to the intercept Holderness shared her story and photos with the FBI 0
540589	Yes 0
541040	Because the FBI was conducting a background check on port which then leads to the report from 0
545400	Politico the FBI 0
546510	Investigation results of importers inability to receive a security clearance in November is preventing him from becoming general Kelly's top deputy 0
553160	Which then brings us to the New York Times? 0
554660	Who say they have two White House officials two sources who said Porter told White House staff these? 0
559560	Allegations were made up and so if all of that reporting was true 0
561950	It's very interesting to see Kelly's statements kind of chain 0
565070	so it's just very interesting to see the kind of change of tone based off of 0
568950	Information it seems that they already knew becoming public and so then that of course brings up the question 0
572960	Why do they wait to move on this? 0
574850	Well the beliefs around that is it might have something to do with him dating or at least hooking up with hope hiks hiks of 0
580220	Course is the White House communications director who's one of trumps closest aides 0
583640	So as he kept on because of his relationship with ho pics 0
586190	But also it could be the other thing because they are in a relationship 0
589050	They may have asked her as he ever as he ever done anything close to what is being described in these stories 0
593940	Maybe she said no and so they believed it and as right now. That's where we are 0
597050	It'll be interesting to see if more information comes out if Porter explains his defense that's that I do want to pass the question off 0
603050	To you what is what is your takeaway from this whole story? 0
605570	What do you think about the initial reaction the reactions after the second story? 0
609650	Well know your thoughts. Also of course if you're willing to share if you're a trump supporter 0
613230	You're a trump hater someone in between I also 0
615530	I also like to know that because then I get to see kind of specific reactions 0
618950	Then we'll talk about one of the more requested stories this week about Doritos 0
622640	If you did not see the CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi was a guest on for economics radio last week and in this interview with 0
628729	The host Stephen Dubner we get this back and forth I understand that men and women eat chips 0
633680	Very differently can you tell us the differences? I you know when you eat out of a flakes bag? 0
637880	You know one of our single serve bags? 0
640710	Especially as you 0
642330	Watch a lot of the young guys eat the chips they love their Doritos 0
646370	And you know they lick their fingers with great Glee and when they reach the bottom of the bag they pour the little 0
653880	Broken pieces into their mouths because they don't want to lose that taste of the flavor and the broken chips and the bottom 0
661890	you know women I think would love to do the same, but they don't they don't like to crunch too loudly in public and 0
669180	You know they don't lick their fingers generously, and they don't like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavor into their mouth 0
676440	So is there like a male and female version of chips that you're playing with or now? 0
680760	It's not a male and female as much as other snacks for women that can be 0
687960	Designed and packaged differently and yes, we are looking at it and 0
692279	We're getting ready to launch a bunch of them soon for women. You know lower crunch 0
697889	the full taste profile 0
700289	You know not have so much of the flavor stick on the fingers 0
703279	And how can you put it in your purse because women love to carry a snack in their purse? 0
708589	And oh did the internet have a field day with this one people saying it's stupid. It's a ridiculous idea 0
713970	It's demeaning to women you had women rights groups speaking out against this a spokesperson for the women's equality party saying companies that perpetuate these 0
721220	Tired gender stereotypes will continue to lose out on the single biggest 0
724470	Consumer group women no doubt some male consumers will welcome the chance to have a bigger package 0
728720	But the idea of shrinking products for women no doubt for the same price as as old as the admin making these decisions following all 0
734569	This when asked about new ease comments and the nude ships a spokesperson for PepsiCo said reporting on a specific Doritos product for female consumers 0
741349	Is inaccurate we already have Doritos for women? 0
743449	They're called Doritos, and they're enjoyed by millions of people every day at the same time 0
747109	We know needs and preferences continue to evolve and we're always looking for new ways to engage and delight our consumers now 0
752269	There are a few things that I won't unpack here one this would be the first time 0
755389	We've seen 0
755970	Gender marketing and gender specific products well obviously you have things that are seemingly more 0
760709	Accepted like razors for women razors for men even there you have anger and debate around what's called the pink tack specifically that female products 0
767389	Cost more than men's products for women 0
769189	we've seen the beer for her the big pen for women because 0
772439	Apparently they need their own and on the opposite. End you have things like Dr 0
776209	Pepper 10 which literally said in commercials not for women that said the difference between a Dr 0
780889	Pepper 10 and a crunch-less ship for ladies. It's different ones like we're guys were big 0
786019	We're loud and crazy, and there's like women have a place. Then as far as the statement of the reporting is inaccurate 0
792439	No, not really the reporting is a recording of your CEO saying stuff based off of everything that we're seeing here 0
799099	It looks like you definitely want to launch new products your CEO says you're set to launch new products some that are not necessarily 0
806519	Lady chips the chips that are aimed at all the stuff ladies like your CEO says it herself low crunch will taste something that you 0
813259	Can you know put in your purse? That's a lot of information to have to have not done research on it? 0
817309	You know tested it out it plans to release something you want to launch tips are going to be targeted for ladies the main person 0
823100	That would consume them would be ladies, but you weren't going to call them lady dorritos 0
826610	That's it and to me that doesn't seem like the biggest deal in the world especially if they're not 0
830970	Labeling it lady chip. I mean think about it 0
833149	If there is any company that has done the research 0
836160	Run through the trials of what people like to eat men, women, old, young, it's going to be this company 0
843170	That said I get why there was a big reaction 0
844730	I don't personally have a big reaction to it 0
846920	But a lot of people just don't like being told like they are this thing. They are in this box 0
851269	They will like this because they are insert this, but that said I will pass the question off to you 0
855439	Do you have the same feeling or different feelings about this story? No? 0
859129	There are a lot of people sounding off on this so I want to hear what you think then I got a lot of requests 0
863720	For this one news broke that VidCon is being purchased by Viacom. VidCon of course one of the largest online video creator 0
870899	Conferences there are now multiple conferences those who have been around for a while 0
874160	You know that it was founded by Hank and John Green every year thousands of people attend last year the one in Anaheim attract around 0
880410	30,000 people including myself I've been to every single one and now after all these years the news has come out that Viacom has acquired 0
886350	Pitka Viacom saying in a blog post a move that will accelerate its participation and investment in next-generation platforms 0
891240	And expand its folks on live events Viacom has acquired VidCon host of the world's largest multi-day conference for the global online community VidCon 0
898220	Which will remain a standalone entity and retain its senior leadership team will be able to considerably expand its global reach with the startup spirit 0
904339	That has allowed it to flourish and this appears to be just part of Viacom's new digital creator put in November Viacom launched Viacom Digital 0
910970	Studios they scooped up kellyday to lead this new studio. She was the CBO previously at awesomenesstv also last month 0
916759	We saw them acquire the influencer marketing firm who say and so this just seems to be the next step for them 0
921410	And so there's move with VidCon honestly from a strategic standpoint. It makes sense new digital studio with someone leading it 0
926329	That's thrived in the space a massive marketing team that once again 0
930179	Understands the space and now you have access to some of the top creators in the world due to your conferences 0
935569	So not only would you be able to use VidCon and its current form and the other versions that you create as a? 0
941009	Promotional tool for your own digital studio it also gives them a fantastic recruiting tool get some of the largest creators in the world 0
947100	Thousands of smaller creators right there in front of you to your doorstep 0
950759	Maybe you can work with them get them to be a part of your new studio once again 0
954259	That's me looking from the outside 0
955910	in a statement around this move we had Hank green saying icon has 0
959030	decades of expertise creating incredible live events for fans 0
961610	And we are building something truly unique by blending that with our team's deep care and passion for the community and culture of online video 0
967220	Take also separately made a video where he? 0
969300	Commented on his past where he was critical of Viacom also noting that Viacom has a lot of experience and making fan first event 0
975960	Successful as far as financial terms of the acquisition 0
978300	That was not disclosed as far as reaction from the community people see them a little bit split 0
982970	and it seems like a lot of people that are excited are people that have a lot of trust and Hank green and 0
986700	Believe that you know he wants this to be successful 0
989300	And so it's gonna be a good move and those are not necessarily happy about this 0
992120	It feels to be for a few different reasons 0
994080	I'm saying you know VidCon was all about by creators for creators now all of a sudden this 0
998760	Corporations coming in it just seems like a money play well 0
1001240	There's not a fan of this just because they don't like Viacom. I remember for years 0
1004930	There was a massive fear that YouTube was going to be shut down by Viacom this because of a lawsuit where Viacom was seeking 1 0
1011290	Billion dollars in damages from YouTube ended up settling that case in 2014 and and as far as my opinion on this 0
1018520	I'm personally at a point where I'm 0
1020780	Skeptical, but I'll wait to see what this actually looks like I already said last year that it might be one of my last year 0
1026380	Is going like for networking purposes? 0
1027640	I still might send a few people from the team, but otherwise what we get for the amount of time we spend there 0
1033740	It's very limited and when I say that I mean like we don't get paid and I'm not asking for payment 0
1037359	I just think that I could have a more fulfilling experience for myself 0
1040099	And the people that watch me if we do our own event and I think that's why you're seeing people like Erin Hanson 0
1045260	Egoraptor launching companies like real good touring a lot of creators want to do in-person things 0
1049840	But they don't have the the team to do the actual touring or creating an event for them so then they go to these things 0
1055510	For free and they help other people build stuff up 0
1057430	And what they actually get out of it is pretty limited so kind of also on that point while I am skeptical of Viacom 0
1062410	I'd be very interested to see what's what new thing what special thing could they do with VidCon? 0
1067900	We'll see I always hope for the best and expect and plan for the worst 0
1071470	And that's actually where I'm going to end today's show and remember if you liked this video be like what I'm trying to do on 0
1075730	This channel hit that like button if you're new here hit that subscribe 0
