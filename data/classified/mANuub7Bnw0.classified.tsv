399	Sup, you Beautiful bastards! 0
1350	Hope you're having a Fantastic Tuesday 0
2139	Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it and the first thing we're going to talk about today 0
7589	By far the most requested story over the past 36 hours 0
10620	And that is the Gavin Free, Meg Turney situation 0
12639	Gavin you most likely know from Rooster Teeth a very popular slo-mo guys channel Meg Turney of course former host of 0
19270	SourceFed rooster, teeth's the know she's big in cosplay 0
22619	I didn't talk about this story yesterday because I was conflicted 0
24900	I didn't know if we should cover the story 0
26820	Or if we did how it's a kind of story that if you cover it the wrong way like some outlets did that it? 0
32500	Potentially makes the problem worse so the news broke this weekend that meg turney and Gavin free were the victims of a home invasion late 0
38460	last month reportedly January 26 0
40450	340 in the morning the couple wakes up to the sound of broken glass and a gunshot and response to this the two of them 0
45210	Hide in their bedroom closet they call police meanwhile the person who broke into their home who I'm not going to name 0
49800	I'm not going to show their picture 0
51510	I'm doing that because I believe this person would have wanted their face plastered all over 0
54840	They would have wanted the notoriety but back to the main point the guy enters the home 0
58469	He's searching for meg and Gavin the police say they have this on security footage. He's armed with a handgun 0
63030	He fires at least one round inside the house 0
65188	He ends up not being able to find them he leaves the home and that's when police arrived the guy was reportedly backing out of 0
70170	The driveway at the time they say that he fired at police officers after being told to stop one officer returned fire and the guy 0
75869	Was shot dead now the reason we know this wasn't a standard 0
78400	Breaking and entering is because of the details police have now given reportedly this guy drove 11 hours from New Mexico to reach them least 0
84600	Describing him as single lonely and disturbed according to documents filed in court after they searched this guy's phone 0
89970	They identified various notations identifying Meg Turney and Gavin free by name, though 0
93630	Cell phone records poorly showed that he had developed a fondness for Meg and very much disliked Gavin lease writing in the court document that 0
99720	This guy resented free for his lifestyle and success a cell phone also showed a police called threatening thoughts one recording stated 0
105780	I want Gavin free to die alone with no children 0
108180	And that's what we know as of right now the case is still under investigation 0
110770	We might get more information 0
112240	Soon for the most part Megan and Gavin have remained silent on this issue at least very publicly that was until yesterday when they both 0
118560	Tweeted their thing terney tweeter. Thank you all so so much for each and every kind message today and a special 0
123390	Thank you to the Austin police for their quick response that night and their ongoing support during this difficult time 0
127890	Aren't you guys so much Gavin tweeting? I just want to say thanks for all the support and concern regarding the recent incident 0
132660	It's been a rough for Megan myself the last few weeks, but we are doing okay. I want to give a huge 0
136200	Thanks to Austin police for the amazing response time. Love you all with that said I think one of the reasons 0
140310	It's important that we cover this story is so that people realize this is this is a real issue 0
144569	It's a very easy to forget and we've talked about issues in the past where fans have have gone up to people's houses 0
149760	They're waiting outside some knock on the door some have actually trespassed while live-streaming a hell 0
155099	I've had issues in the past where people found our studio actually walked into my room while I was filming and since then we've up 0
160620	security I try not to tweet when I'm traveling because one of the last times that happened someone broke into my home while my 0
166450	Wife and my son were sleeping luckily she had a weapon called police 0
170040	They responded very fast then separate from that we can't forget things like Christina Grimmie 0
174400	ZAPPIN less than two years ago rising star prominent youtuber fantastic person shot and killed at her own 0
181480	Meet-and-greet by a disturbed fan, so if there's anything we can accomplish with this story 0
184810	It's to remind people that the people that you are watching online on your phone on your TV 0
190260	They are just people having their privacy and security breach 0
193359	Shouldn't just be something that is cast off as something that just comes with the job like I've seen in some 0
198040	Comment sections these are real people that have reason to fear that they will be the next person in a headline 0
203310	And that's one of the reasons why yes, it's great that you feel a connection with someone that you're watching 0
207280	But you also need to understand boundaries 0
210080	You can't just concede and say this is the new normal obviously prep for the worst 0
214200	But but we shouldn't... we shouldn't just go "yeah, that's just the way it is now", but that said, 0
218700	I will pass the question off to you. What are your thoughts around this situation? 0
222200	and then very briefly, I just want to talk about the situation with Vanessa Trump--Donald Trump Junior's wife yesterday 0
226200	Vanessa, her daughter, [and] a third individual were rushed to the hospital. It was because they received and opened a letter that had a white substance 0
232080	Inside of it. Reportedly, it was addressed to Donald Trump Jr. The wife handled it, handed it to the daughter 0
236700	She opens the letter. There's the white substance 0
238380	There's a note that reportedly reads "You're an awful person and now you get what you deserve." They're decontaminated there, 0
242819	They're rushed to the hospital for examination. It was later discovered that the white substance was cornstarch. 0
247739	While I found online most people be taking the situation as serious as one should, I was also troubled by the number of people that were 0
254160	Happy that it happened, and this is before they even found out the substance wasn't harmful 0
258329	I do hope that people realize that people's politics should not play into how you feel about this situation 0
263280	We're all people and I know there are some people going like "well it just ended up being cornstarch," 0
267040	can you imagine the fear not only that she had but her daughter had 0
271700	It's disgusting and horrible thing for a person to do and it's also a disgusting and horrible thing to root on and be happy about 0
278580	I mean would you have the same reaction if this happened to one of one of Barack Obama's daughters? 0
282009	That's where I leave that. It's just a bad situation in general 0
284110	Not only for what happened 0
285219	But now there'll be people using this story and people that had what and what I consider outlier responses as a way to 0
291500	Overwhelmingly label people on the left, but that's where that's where I'm gonna end it from that. I want to share some stuff 0

354759	Special got a new trailer for the movie rampage starring the rock 0

364180	And we got the honest trailer for the Blade trilogy 0
366319	The cast of Black Panther touching and doing some weird stuff if you want to see the full versions of everything 0
370779	I just shared the secret link of the day anything at all 0
373550	Links as always are in the description down below then and why people angry about today news we had people 0
378259	Specifically a lot of parents angry at a CGI rabbit 0
381560	Specifically Peter Rabbit Sony Pictures has been on the receiving end of a lot of outrage over a scene that has now been deemed 0
387409	controversial in their new film Peter Rabbit 0
389500	I'm actually watch this movie because my oldest son who's almost four is now at that prime age where you can watch a full movie 0
394810	In a theater and not be a loud annoying jerk 0
396969	It's a new fantastic development, but I'll paint the scene for you Peter Rabbit and his bunny family 0
401069	They are at odds with a character called mr.. McGregor during the course of the film they hear mr. 0
404879	McGregor say that he is a food allergy that he is allergic to 0
407650	blackberries upon hearing this Peter Rabbit kind of makes fun like Oh 0
410439	Everyone's allergic to everything these days and then later on the film when mr. McGregor is trying to kill them 0
415240	They slingshot a blackberry into his mouth 0
417840	And he has an allergic reaction after that McGregor turns rat he starts choking he luckily jabs himself in the leg with an EpiPen oh 0
423900	My god the backlash with allergy advocacy grooves parents of children with food allergies 0
428349	Saying that this is disgust their mocking an attack that could have been fatal in real life the charity group kids with food allergies 0
433810	Posting a warning about the scene on Facebook saying the scene may be 0
436780	Disturbing the young viewers who have a food allergy the character is intentionally attacked with his allergen leading to anaphylaxis and the use of epinephrine 0
443310	Parents should be aware of this before your children see the movie so you can talk with your children about it AFA believes the food 0
447870	Allergy jokes are harmful to our community during a reaction patients require the life-saving drug 0
452050	Epinephrine and must go to the nearest hospital for follow-up treatment the very real fear and anxiety that people experience during an allergic reaction 0
457960	often referred to as an impending sense of doom is a serious matter making light of this condition hurts our members because it encourages the 0
464009	public not to take the risk of allergic reaction 0
466000	Seriously, and this cavalier attitude may make them act in ways that could put an allergic person in danger 0
470550	We then saw petitions pop up calling for Sony to apologize saying the scene was socially irresponsible 0
475089	Saw the rise and use of the hashtag boycott Peter Rabbit and following all of this outrage in a statement the filmmakers and Sony Pictures 0
482229	Apologized writing food allergies are a serious issue our films should not have made light of Peter rabbit's archenemy mr. 0
487379	McGregor being allergic to 0
488500	blackberries even in a cartoonish slapstick way 0
490680	He sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue 0
493379	And we truly apologize and here's what I'll say to this whole issue 0
496240	Yes, food allergies are a very serious issue according to allergy org up to 15 million Americans have food allergies including 5.9 0
502830	Million children under the age of 18 suggest in the States it's 1 in 13 children obviously the allergies range in severity 0
508169	But it's still a decent numbers 0
509550	We look to the news bullying children with food allergies is a very real thing back in December 0
513659	We had three teens facing criminal charges for knowingly exposing an allergic 0
516610	Classmate to pineapple a 14 year old girl was accused of rubbing pineapple on her hand and then 0
520690	High-fiving a girl that was allergic to the fruit during lunch in July a 13 year old London boy with a dairy allergy died after 0
525990	Suffering a severe reaction to a piece of cheese allegedly forced onto him during a school break 0
529920	But on the other end the argument against this movie is either ignorant or knowingly misleading in my opinion having watched the movie 0
536960	I think there's two points to hit on one when Peter Rabbit kind of makes fun of everyone having allergies 0
541470	He also is like oh no, but it is a very serious issue 0
544010	I don't want to get any letters wing and so to me that seemed to be kind of making fun of people that say they're 0
547850	Allergic to things without actually having gone to a doctor and the doctor going oh, yeah 0
551240	You're allergic to this MLA specifically 0
552830	There's a lot of self diagnosed celiac disease, then also acknowledging that yes 0
556370	People are actually allergic to things and to it the other part of the movie where they were there shooting blackberries at mr. 0
561590	McGregor and they get one in his mouth the full context of that situation is mr. 0
564740	McGregor was trying to murder that whole rabbit family during of course the movie 0
567650	He's been trying to electrocute them blow them up with dynamite cut their heads off with a hoe 0
572510	So this is one of their only defenses from a probable deaths when I see people like L M 0
577010	Thomas meeting as a father of a son who has allergies to peanuts milk egg 0
579950	I refused to watch Peter Rabbit because Sony Pictures is sending a message 0
582860	It's okay to bully kids with allergy and making it a joke to get a few laughs 0
585950	Okay, so you didn't see the movie and you're assuming cool hydro 0
587990	Girl 71 riding as a mother of a toddler allergic to several foods 0
591110	I am disgusted that Sony would make a joke out of flicking an allergen at a food allergic 0
594930	Individual doing so is felony aggravated assault 0
597110	What kind of message does that scene send to kids well I guess one if there was a message there? 0
601280	It would be if someone's trying to murder you find their weakness and take them out first I guess better question 0
606170	What kind of message does it send that you're complaining on the internet rather than I don't know maybe having a conversation with your children 0
612410	And then I could continue going through the tweets, but it's all about bullying and harassing people with food allergies 0
616250	Which if you actually watch the movie before complaining you would know that's not the situation 0
620150	But why be informed when you can use your feelings as your facts there? You go. That was a story? 0
624980	That's my opinion, and I'd love to know your thoughts on them 0
627260	And then let's talk about updates around the Rob Porter situation we talked about Rob last Friday 0
631040	He was the White House staff secretary before his ex-wives came out with allegations and separate articles that he was abusive 0
637100	the women talking about verbal and emotional 0
638970	Abuse as well as physical one of the wives even sharing a photo of black eyes 0
642350	She said that she received from Porter and following all of this Porter resigned although 0
646160	He said that he was innocent one of the biggest parts of this story has been the reaction 0
650010	From the White House, and how some of the stories really don't seem to add up 0
653840	There's one version events 0
655100	We've done from White House officials when talking to reporters White House was asked for comment on a story that was about to come out 0
659450	The White House press arm then talked to Porter they then brought general Kelly a hold on those a story with horrible 0
664560	allegations against Porter one that included domestic abuse then see Sara Huckabee Sanders Kelly others 0
669450	Respond and defend port and on midday Wednesday of reportedly the White House press team said that no one had asked reporters 0
675120	Resignation in fact there were reports that several senior officials actually told Porter to stay in fight 0
679670	And then when Porter resigned White House press secretary 0
682080	Sarah Huckabee Sanders while standing at the podium said no one asked for him to resign, but he still did 0
686780	But then we also got a different version of event one where on Tuesday Porter tells Kelly that there 0
691040	There's a damaging story coming out and says that it's about allegations of verbal and emotional 0
694560	Abuse according to this account Kelly says there is there any domestic abuse Porter says no and after the story broke on Tuesday Kelly realized 0
700940	He had been lied to within 40 minutes 0
702710	Kelly demanded Porter's resignation so as you may have noticed that 0
705510	Timeline doesn't match up to what we saw publicly if Kelly had realized Porter had lied to him 0
710090	Why would he have drafted a statement to defend it? 0
712310	I mean the John Kelly quote literally read Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can't say enough good things 0
716780	About it, also seemingly not adding up 0
718970	We had the budget director Mick Mulvaney was on CBS's Face the Nation and he said Porter was actually given the benefit of the doubt 0
724950	Until those photos came out of the black eye those photos in come out till Wednesday 0
728780	And also we haven't even touched on once again the fact that with with Porter being in his position he had been the recipient of 0
733850	a massive FBI background check background check according to deputy press secretary 0
737940	Raja last week was still ongoing which if it was ongoing could maybe explain why general Kelly had not known this information 0
744420	But then today in walks an FBI director Christopher R a congressional hearing today 0
749060	he contradicted with 0
750570	Rajasah according to Ray the FBI gave the White House a partial background check report on Porter in March they then submitted a completed report 0
757520	in July and then fully closed the 0
759630	investigation in January 0
760850	And we know from the ex-wives that they talk with the FBI and said that he was 0
764610	Abusive also an important note here because I've seen some people on social media saying you know like Christopher raised this outsider 0
769580	That's trying to attack Donald in the White House is that I would like to remind you that Christopher Rea was actually hand selected 0
774050	he wasn't nominated by Trump his Trump appointment and ultimately we have a 0
777450	Situation where it seems like what we're looking at it's one of two things might have people that are lying or they're stupid 0
782960	Confused when Raja said there was an ongoing investigation 0
785520	The only thing that could even be close to that here's me that after the FBI closed the investigation back in Jan 0
791200	We're FBI director a says the bureau received additional information after the file was closed and they passed that on to the White House 0
796630	That's not the investigation on Porter continuing as far as the FBI is concerned so you're either stupid 0
801190	Or you're knowingly 0
802160	misleading people the rest of the 0
803390	Responses timeline that doesn't seem to add up new attempt at a timeline where Kelly says you're going to resign 0
808570	But at the same time was defending him in a public statement doesn't seem to make sense 0
812030	It's with all of that said I do want to pass a question off to you 0
814600	What is your takeaway from this story? 0
816370	It is from last week to this week the story has seemingly evolved from this is a story about domestic abuse 0
821500	This is the story about a potential cover-up and people in the White House lying to the public and that's where I'm going to end 0
825850	Today's show remember if you like this video like what I try and do on this channel 0
829400	That like button if you're new here hit that subscribe button also make sure you got that little Bell check so you got a notification 0
