52710	is that it uses a six point four inch 0
55140	OLED panel it's got a dual camera setup 0
58230	on the back that was actually pretty 0
60690	snappy but we can't evaluate the image 0
62910	quality in a setting like this it's got 0
64709	a pretty clean black and gold overall 0
66810	design and on the bottom you'll find on 0
68939	microUSB that was a little disappointing 0

87150	know so what happens here is there's a 0
89729	glass digitizer that's on top then 0

94110	and then there are actually little holes 0
96829	that allow light from the panel to 0
100200	bounce off of your finger and through to 0
102990	the sensor underneath it reading your 0
105390	fingerprint now the speed is not as fast 0
107640	as something like an iPhone 8 but it's 0
109229	also not as slow as some of the early 0
111570	generation touch sensors so I didn't 0
113430	feel like there was really any 0
114600	compromise that I was making in using it 0

140040	background the only time you can see it 0
142260	is kind of at an angle like this by the 0
