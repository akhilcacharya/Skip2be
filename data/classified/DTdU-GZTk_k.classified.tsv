13830	we're here at glowforge checking out 0
16109	their glowforge it's a laser etcher and 0
19109	cutter that is more set up and designed 0
21390	for everyone to be able to use instead 0
23550	of just engineers and the features that 0
26400	bring it to that point start with their 0
28500	easy web app where you can upload 3d 0
30929	grayscale images and raster or vector 0
33300	formats it can auto detect the material 0
36120	that you put inside if you use there 0
38100	proof grade materials if not you can 0
40230	just tell it what material is inside it 0
42570	can cut things or engrave things like 0
44820	plastics and woods and it has lots of 0
47160	really cool automatically based features 0
49079	like the one we used here which was able 0
51510	to cut our logo into a puzzle without us 0
55079	doing any extra work and the quality of 0
57239	life improvements just kind of keep on 0
58980	going it has a camera built into it so 0
61020	that you can actually see what the laser 0
63210	engravers see so when you need to set 0
64920	your object inside you don't have to do 0
66810	it with a whole bunch of different 0
67619	measurements and stuff you can just line 0
68970	it up with a camera and you're good to 0
70560	go it also is able to auto focus the 0
72900	camera along a curve so if you're doing 0
74850	something like engraving the top of a 0
77070	Macbook it can see the edges and engrave 0
79860	along the edges autofocusing the laser 0
81720	so you don't have any mistakes on the 0
83340	side and you don't have to do anything 0
84540	way too fancy they use mirrors to 0
86640	redirect the laser this can sometimes be 0
88200	an issue because if the mirror is 0
89490	misaligned 0
90270	it can cause various problems we would 0
92430	prefer that they use something like 0
93750	fiber optics but they put the mirrors 0
96450	into solid aluminum blocks and once a 0
98729	bolt is in place those things aren't 0
100140	moving so it should probably be fine the 0
102000	delicate components in the head are also 0
103770	completely sealed off which is great 0
105540	because that means less maintenance for 0
107670	you as it won't be able to get gummed up 0
109259	but if you do need to access it you can 0
111360	just simply remove it with a few magnets 0
112890	there's three stepper motors to move 0
114780	everything around you've got one on each 0
116460	side to control the y-axis and then one 0
118799	in the back to control the x-axis the 0
121110	laser moves along with the head in terms 0
123540	of the y-axis to keep everything aligned 0
126600	thing that you might notice is that it's 0
127950	not the biggest unit ever but that 0
129508	doesn't completely limit you in terms of 0
131730	y-axis printing you can actually print 0
133709	things that go pretty far because it has 0
136560	a pass-through slot so you can feed 0
138480	things through the laser engraver while 0
140640	it's going so it doesn't completely work 0
143489	right now but theoretically what will 0
145440	happen is you'll put part of it in it'll 0
147959	laser engrave what it needs to it'll cut 0
150180	what it needs to and then when it's 0
151650	ready you can feed more of it in and 0
153959	they'll just do the next part and so on 0
155640	and so forth until you're done but said 0
157680	pass-through slot does come at an 0
159690	additional expense if you do want the 0
161910	basic version that's four thousand 0
164040	dollars it comes with a 40 watt laser 0
165600	and that's about it no pass-through slot 0
168330	no built-in venting if you do want to 0
171180	vent it out you can send it out through 0
172590	a window or you can just do it outside 0
174540	or something like that or you can spend 0
176970	a thousand dollars and buy that built-in 0
178860	vent if you want to jump up to the pro 0
180569	version that's eight thousand dollars it 0
182549	has that $1,000 vent built-in it has the 0
185850	pass-through slot and it has a 45 watt 0
188459	laser so that can do faster cuts well 0
190890	for the average consumer 0
