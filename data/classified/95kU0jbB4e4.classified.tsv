0	Guys, today's show is gonna be different. 0
1960	I'm only really gonna be talking about one thing. 0
4200	You just need to talk about it. I didn't include it in yesterday's show because I didn't want to do this this rush job on an incredibly serious situation. 0
11660	I want to make sure we had as many facts as possible. 0
14700	I also want to make sure that even by accident we weren't exploiting a tragedy. Which is why there are no ads on this video. 0
20300	And, so with that said, we need to talk about the shooting that happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. 0
24700	As of recording this video, 17 people have died, 14 have been injured. 0
28220	Of those 14, five have life-threatening injuries. 0
30800	It was among the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. 0
33720	It is the worst school shooting since Sandy Hook. 0
36400	But, that said, let's talk about the timeline. 0
37900	The shooting reportedly happened just before 3:00 P.M. yesterday. 0
40100	Reportedly, started moments before the students were set to be dismissed. 0
42900	The gunman who if you're new here, whenever we talk about these kind of mass shootings, I don't show faces. I don't share names. 0
48200	I personally just don't want to promote that garbage. But, we should still discuss details so we can learn from this situation. 0
53400	So, with that said, reportedly the gunman was a 19-year-old former student of the school. 0
56620	He was armed with a semi-automatic AR-15 with what police are describing as, "countless magazines." 0
61700	He first opened fire outside the school where he killed three people, one on a nearby street corner, two just outside the school. 0
67100	He then made his way inside where he opened fire on students, and teachers. 0
70280	Reportedly, a fire alarm went off right before the shots were heard inside the school. 0
73400	Investigators believe that he may have actually pulled the fire alarm so students would go out into the hallways. 0
77700	But, this hasn't been fully confirmed yet. 0
79400	Also, according to reports the school had actually had a fire drill earlier in the day so many people did go into the hallways thinking it was the same thing. 0
85210	Others stayed in their classrooms because they thought it was weird to have another drill in the same day. 0
89200	Several students posted videos of the gunfire inside the school others called, and texted loved ones. 0
93400	Also, on this note, and it is an aside, but I want to hit on it before we continue this conversation. 0
98940	To people like Mark Dice, who tweeted: 0
100420	"Someone want to tell the Generation Z kids that in the event of a school shooting, they should call 911 instead of posting video of it on Snapchat. Parkland. Florida." 0
107200	100% go fuck yourself right in your stupid fucking face!! 0
110400	How dare you criticize the actions of fucking children in the midst of a school shooting!! 0
115620	As one student even responded: 0
116960	"By the way as we were running for our lives we were calling 911 to the point that they told us not to anymore." 0
121500	Also, you don't know how you're gonna react in a moment like that. 0
123700	I had a student reach out to me via Twitter in a closet. 0
126400	When I responded, "I said don't worry about anyone covering this story. Just make sure you're safe." 0
130780	Meanwhile, other reporters are trying into that person's DM. 0
133800	After being evacuated, they then responded: 0
135780	"I'm traumatized. I don't even remember tweeting you and I'm not sure why I did." 0
139000	And, so to Mark, and anyone that I had the same mindset of Mark, how about, how about you don't take a verbal shot at the kids that were actually shot at?! 0
145160	You're disgusting!! 0
145900	But, back to the main story. The shootings happening at 2:53 P.M. Broward County Sheriff's Office tweets: 0
149740	"BSO is working a developing incident regarding a report of active shooters. Here's what we know so far: 0
153660	Deputies are responding to reports of a shooting at Stoneman Douglas High. There are reports of victims. PIO will be on scene 3:15 pm." 0
159600	As law enforcement arrives, they begin helping students flee the school. They start searching for the shooter. 0
163900	The shooter then reportedly fled the scene himself. 0
165480	He initially avoid the police detection by blending in with the other students who are running away. 0
169100	But, he luckily didn't get far, because police were able to identify the shooter using the school security cameras. 0
173500	And, this is just an hour after arriving on the scene, the police found the suspect a few miles away in a residential neighborhood. 0
178000	And, they end up arresting him without incident. The shooter so far has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. 0
183160	And, as of recording this video, a judge's denied him bail. 0
185600	And, since this happened yesterday, we have now learned background information. 0
188384	As mentioned earlier, we learned the shooter used in AR-15, which now we know ATF has confirmed the shooter legally purchased this year, and passed the required background check. 0
195720	We also learned that the gunman had posted some disturbing images on social media, disturbing comments on Instagram, and YouTube. 0
201200	Also, specifically regarding the comments, reportedly the FBI had been made aware of threatening comments. 0
206400	This thanks to 36-year-old YouTuber, Ben Bennight. 0
208400	He reportedly alerted the FBI with a screenshot. He also called their Mississippi office. 0
212900	A comment which featured the shooter's name back in September reading: 0
215640	"I'm going to be a professional school shooter." 0
217460	According to Ben, they did an in-person interview with him the very next day, saying: 0
220200	"They came to my office the next morning and asked me if I knew anything about the person." 0
223100	"I didn't. They took a copy of the screenshot and that was the last I heard from them." 0
226300	And then, at a news conference this morning, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Rob Lasky, spoke about this: 0
230400	"In 2017, the FBI received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel." 0
235120	"The common comment simply said, 'I'm going to be a professional school shooter.'" 0
242120	"No other information was included with that comment, which would indicate a time, location for the true identity of the person who made the comment." 0
251900	"The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment." 0
261200	Although, there has been criticism to the FBI's response there, because the YouTube comment literally had the shooter's name on it. 0
267100	It's also been reported by media, and a very important note here, not confirmed by law enforcement yet that the shooter left several other troubling comments, including: 0
273960	"I wanna to shoot people with my AR-15." 0
276000	"I want to die fighting killing shit ton of people." 0
278360	"I'm going to kill law enforcement one day they go after the good people." 0
280600	As far as why the shooter was a former student, reportedly he was expelled from the high school for disciplinary reasons last year. 0
286000	That said there aren't confirmed details about the reason for his expulsion right now. 0
288700	We've also seen other students describing him as troubled with few friends. 0
291780	One student even saying: 0
292940	"Honestly a lot of people were saying that it was going to be him, a lot of kids threw jokes around like that, saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out you know, everyone predicted it. That's crazy." 0
300100	We also learned today that the shooter was a member of a White Nationalist Organization. 0
303500	They're called, "The Republic of Florida." 0
304780	They say they consider themselves, "a white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics." 0
309860	Adding, "The ultimate creation of a white ethnos state so we can be free from anti-white policies and have policies that reflect our values as white westerners." 0
316200	And, we know that, because a Captain for the Republic of Florida said: 0
319020	""ROF hosted a "paramilitary" training session in the Tallahassee area that he attended."" 0
322540	"He probably used that training to do what he did yesterday." 0
324420	"Nobody I know told him to do that. He just freaked out." 0
326690	Adding, "I know he knew full well he was joining a white separatist paramilitary proto-fascist organization. I know he knew that much." 0
332900	And, following this situation, we're kind of seeing the, "same gun reform dance," that we always see after something like this. 0
339100	Many people saying we need gun reform, and obviously here, it's varying levels. 0
342500	You've people who are calling for a full outright ban of all guns to people just talking about mental health, access things, like that. 0
349100	Right. And then, a lot of people in the middle of that range. 0
350700	Then, you have people on the other end of things saying more guns. 0
352910	That's what we actually need because when you create gun-free zones like a school, you're actually just creating a target. 0
358300	And then, finally, you have the third group which I personally I will just throw this out there just for transparency sake, I find the most infuriating. 0
364880	Tomi Lahren's of the world who say that it's too soon to talk about it. 0
367600	I saw one of her all-encompassing Tweets she put out yesterday, reading: 0
370600	"Can the left let the families grieve for even 24 hours before they push their anti-gun and anti-gun owner agenda? My goodness. This isn't about a gun it's about another lunatic." 0
377660	Here's the thing a conversation of how do we make sure less people get murdered?! 0
381720	Less children are killed?! 0
383520	That we shouldn't be like, "let's wait." 0
385600	Talk about how to prevent further death shouldn't be a partisan issue. 0
388900	One, for damn sure, the person that shot off this school was a dreamer, was an illegal immigrant, a refugee, 100% within 24 hours, Tomi Lahren would be sounding off. 0
397800	Which is why, two, I think that we need to have a conversation as fast as possible, no matter what. 0
401600	If someone shoots of a school, let's immediately talk about guns, and potential solutions. 0
405000	If an illegal immigrant, or refugee was the shooter, let's also talk about border security, and immigration policy. 0
410300	Let's say that illegal immigrant, or refugee didn't use a gun, maybe they ran people over with a van, then let's still talk about border security, and immigration policy. 0
416500	We should be talking about any, and all key aspects contributing factors that led to the death of innocence. 0
421100	Why are we picking, and choosing when murder matters?! 0
423500	And, I say this is someone that used to say the same thing that people I now find infuriating say, "You know let's wait before we talk about this." 0
430029	No. Because it just keeps happening- and-happening-and-happening, and when we need to talk about solutions as fast as possible. 0
435100	Prevention is all about getting in front of something. The timing is incredibly important. 0
438800	And, as far as this section, I'm not saying what's right, and what's wrong, but we need to talk about solutions. That's my main point. 0
444800	But, where I want to close this story, is on people like Aaron Fies. 0
447400	Aaron was a football coach, and a security guard at the school. He reportedly stepped in front of students, and was shot shielding them from gunfire. 0
453600	He ended up being rushed to a hospital. He ended up dying there. 0
456000	A spokeswoman for the school saying, "He died the same way -- he lived he put himself second." 0
460280	Also adding, "He was a very kind soul, a very nice man. He died a hero." 0
463700	That's who I want to feature, and show, and name in this video, not that murdering trash bag. 0
467800	People like Aaron Feis. People like Scott Beagle. Other people's names are now coming through. 0
471400	Scott was the 35-year-old geography teacher. 0
473300	According to reports, while the shooter was active in the hallway, he unlocked the door to his room to get other students to safety. 0
479600	Unfortunately, before Scott was able to get back to the room, he was shot, and killed. 0
482600	Also, I think it's incredibly important, we think of, thank, and send lots of love to law enforcement, and first responders on the scene. 0
487800	And also, looking at the names, and pictures of the young kids that were killed. 0
491600	Because it's incredibly important to remember that this happened to real people. 0
494600	Stories like this they quickly become about numbers, statistics. 0
497460	He starts seeing spreadsheets, and you lose the human element. 0
501100	Children died. Adults died. 0
502800	And, every second, we don't talk about how to prevent the next one of theses happening?! 0
507420	Or, we're doing all of these people a disservice. 0
510000	But, that's where I'm gonna end the story in today's show. I do want to - I want to pass a question off to you. 0
514840	What is - What is your feeling around this?! 0
517200	I know. I know. I normally do though you know, "subscribe, like thing." We don't need that today. 0
521799	If you've got people in your life today, if they're right there with you, give them a hug. 0
525520	Let them know you love them. 0
526420	If they're not with you, send them a text, give them a phone call, a FaceTime, or whatever. 0
530540	Just-Just love someone while you have them. 0
532600	The world is a stupid horrifying place where were you, or someone you love may not be here tomorrow. 0
537300	So, just-just love people while you have them. 0
539700	And, with that said, my name is Philip DeFranco. I love your faces, and I will see you tomorrow. 0
