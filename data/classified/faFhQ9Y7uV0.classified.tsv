30	thank you to a group were known for 1
989	sponsoring this video at CES 2018 you 1
2850	can check out there symbiosis concept 1
4410	car in the description down below we're 1
6420	talking with the Jenna vation KB 170 l 0
8580	and one other keyboard play you have to 0
10110	wait for that this one as you can see 0
11880	immediately has 66 macro keys at the top 0
15570	of the keyboard each one of those keys 0
17340	can take 220 character inputs you do 0
20789	that by switching a switch just right 0
22590	here on the back of the keyboard from 0
24269	program mode to keyboard mode and you 0
26400	can type all that kind of stuff in to 0
27810	program those individual keys there's 0
29880	only one profile for these keys but you 0
32369	easily switch to another mode by holding 0
35309	shift just like you would for any other 0
36780	key on the keyboard to switch to 0
38690	essentially another set of 66 more macro 0
42540	keys all of the keys at the top have 0
45120	these clear top covers on them so you 0
47190	can print out little cards for each one 0
49020	of them insert it under the top cover 0
50610	and then be able to reference what 0
52379	that's actually for in the future which 0
54300	is really helpful because well they're 0
56520	programmable keys so they're what you 0
58500	set them to not what they're 0
59640	pre-programmed for so they can't come 0
60899	with labels on them they are single-shot 0
63449	abs key caps naturally due to the cap on 0
65640	top of them and these standard qwerty 0
67470	keys are double shot key caps and I want 0
69659	to show you guys something right here 0
70770	this whole keyboard if I try to grab it 0
73350	pretty firmly on each side and try to 0
74970	twist it it essentially doesn't twist at 0
77580	all and I'm giving it quite a bit of 0
79110	force I have seen drastically more 0
81420	keyboard twists intend keyless keyboards 0
84240	that don't have three rows of macro keys 0
87000	above it then this one does it's it's 0
89040	build quite well there's a metal plate 0
90990	throughout the entire thing so ways to 0
93270	point to kilograms are four point eight 0
95250	five pounds that's a lot for a keyboard 0
96900	good for bashing zombies with or just 0
98430	staying where it's supposed to be on 0
100500	your desk they did however take some 0
102960	precautions and making it as compact as 0
105000	they could you can see compared to a 0
106920	standard keyboard there isn't this 0
108509	divide between the F keys and the normal 0
110700	core D keys they shrank that down 0
112380	whether that's a positive or negative 0
114149	I'm not entirely sure personally I think 0
116310	my muscle memory would make it so that 0
117630	when I go to press escape I would end up 0
119460	pressing this macro key in the corner 0
120990	but you know making the macro keys at 0
123990	the very top actually more pressable 0
125520	it's probably benefit for that so 0
126960	depends on you in terms of usability the 0
129389	switches are 0
130679	IMX blacks there's a USB pass-through 0
133319	port on the back of the keyboard and 0
135209	when you're in program mode there is a 0
137159	little light just next to numb log caps 0
139230	lock and scroll lock so that you know 0
140879	that you're in program mode and not 0
142170	typing though this keyboard was just 0
144209	announced at the show and will probably 0
145769	be available through Amazon but just in 0
147569	case you can get it at DSi - keyboards 0
149939	comm the backlit version will cost three 0
152340	hundred and forty dollars and the non 0
154650	backlit version will cost two eighty to 0
156810	ninety around there next up we have the 0
159329	lens in GK 358 which as you can see it's 0
162689	quite water resistant it's an IP 68 0
164669	rated keyboard meaning that it can be 0
167159	submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water 0
169769	for 30 minutes but they don't know the 0
172260	maximum depth that it can be submerged 0
173849	for because it's made for like spills 0
176310	and stuff not actually gaming underwater 0
178290	they did say however that it can be 0
180510	underwater to some degree for a boat up 0
183209	to a week which is pretty cool it's also 0
185459	only thirty bucks and features double 0
187469	shot injected key caps and back letting 0
190109	the backlighting is for different colors 0
192150	across the board not RGB LEDs but there 0
194940	is different lighting modes as well so 0
197040	if you hold the function key and press 0
198329	scroll lock it will change what lighting 0
200400	mode it's in we have experienced a 0
203159	couple glitches while sitting here but 0
205109	it seems to be only if you like get 0
207329	water on it and then lift it up 0
209010	vertically so the water goes up into the 0
211019	key caps that there is any problem so if 0
212549	you spill stuff on your keyboard maybe 0
214109	don't like pour the water into the top 0
216959	of the key caps and you'll probably be 0
218639	fine it does also feature an actually 0
220500	pretty nice colored metal top but there 0
223319	is a little bit of flex actually a fair 0
225689	amount of flex it is a thirty dollar 0
227129	keyboard so I maybe wouldn't worry about 0
228599	that too much this is the price range 0
230790	that you're shopping for 0
231780	it features an optical switch I have not 0
234090	personally seen before manufactured by a 0
236669	Taiwanese company called ever light 0
238949	other notable features is that there's 0
241079	RGB lighting along the sides of the 0
243419	keyboards which is pretty cool it's only 0
245129	two milliseconds of delay and this metal 0
247259	plate comes in either black or blue it 0
249659	will be available on Alibaba or BB r86 0
253290	comm so cool there's a keyboard that you 1
256380	can use literally underwater I'm typing 1
259079	right now and I can see it on the screen 1
260399	over there pretty sweet if you're more 1
262079	interested in things outside of the 1

268800	symbiote scar in France not that long 1
271199	ago and he was able to experience level 1
273240	4 automation that means he was able to 1
275190	sit in the driver's seat and not drive 1
277380	he just used his laptop while he was 1
279240	sitting there and it drove him down real 1
