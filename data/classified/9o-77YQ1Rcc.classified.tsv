0	Sup! You beautiful bastards. 0
1160	hope you're having a fantastic Monday 0
2860	February 19th, 2018. Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it! 0
7800	And the first thing I wanna talk about today, one of the more requested stories of the day. 0
11160	Let's talk about this situation around LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Laura Ingraham. 0
15400	On February 15th LeBron James, Kevin Durant do an interview. 0
17900	It was a segment for a show called "Uninterrupted". 0
19920	it talked about things like President Trump 0
21920	the country, other social issues. 0
23680	and in that video interview, we see this: 0
25480	The number one job in America 0
28560	the point of person, is someone who doesn't understand the people. 0
32540	and really don't give a fuck about the people 0
34940	when we talkin' about leadership and what's goin' on in our country 0
38760	it's all about leadership 0
40400	and I learned that playing basketball, you know? I learned a lot of life skills from playing basketball 0
44180	you need that power of people, you need to, you know, encourage people, and that's what 0
48060	builds a great team and I feel like our team as a, as a country, is not ran by a great coach 0
53960	it's not even a surprise when he says somethin' 0
56480	it's not even surprise, it's like laughable, it's like- 0
59100	it's laughable 0
60100	and it's scary 0
61180	and in response to that, later that night, Fox news host Laura Ingraham criticized the players 0
65239	saying LeBron's comments were barely intelligible, they were ungrammatical, adding 0
68980	here's this barely intelligible, not to mention ungrammatical, take on president Trump 0
74980	in a new ESPN podcast 0
77160	I'm numb to this commentary, like 0
79120	must they run their mouths like that? 0
80520	unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take this ignorant comments seriously 0
85400	look, there might be a cautionary lesson 0
87640	in LeBron for kids 0
89160	this is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA 0
94380	and it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year 0
99740	to bounce a ball 0
100460	oh and LeBron and Kevin, you're great players, but no one voted for you 0
104040	millions elected Trump to be their coach 0
106400	so keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said 0
109940	shut up and dribble 0
111200	and following this we saw a lot of big reactions online 0
113300	some saying, yeah, Laura's right, stick to basketball 0
115740	don't talk about politics 0
117100	others saying no, these guys are just embracing their freedom of speech 0
119840	they're giving their opinion on something 0
121520	some going as far to say Ingraham's comments were racist 0
123740	we then saw Ingraham respond to those allegations of racism 0
126340	and ultimately her defense is I've told people to shut up and blank for years 0
129539	saying 0
152920	following this we saw LeBron responding over the weekend 0
155880	we will definitely not, uh, shut up and dribble 0
158380	I would definitely not do that, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to the, to the- to so many kids 0
162420	that feel like they don't have a, um, they don't have a way out 0
164660	and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they're in 0
168060	also, I wish she would've did a little bit more fact checking because I actually did 0
171700	finish high school and didn't leave early 0
173420	I graduated high school 0
174620	the best thing she did is gonna help me, is create more awareness 0
178040	and I get, I get to sit up here and talk about social injustice, equality, and why a woman on 0
185060	a certain network decided to tell me to shut up and, and dribble 0
188360	and as far as my personal response to this 0
190040	uh, uh, I, I'm not even gonna touch the, you know, the intention, was it racism, blah, blah, blah part 0
194540	but I do think Laura Ingraham's point is ridiculous as well as- considering that she is on Fox news 0
199360	and the guests they bring on Fox news, it's very hypocritical 0
202660	I'll hit specifics on that point in a second 0
203900	1: I think it's ridiculous to disqualify someone's opinion on something because of their job 0
208340	or the amount of money they make 0
209460	before Donald Trump was president, he said he had billions, we know that he had at least hundreds of millions of dollars 0
213920	yes he was a businessman, but he was also a reality TV star 0
216700	just because he wasn't elected at that time 0
218200	doesn't mean that Donald Trump's opinions and reactions on things should've been disqualified 0
222000	using your same argument, we could also say why should we care what Laura says 0
225060	she wasn't elected 0
226020	as far as the hypocritical point, I'll just piggy-back on what Chris Long pointed out 0
229040	Chris Long of course Eagles defensive end, two time Super Bowl champion 0
232420	you've also probably seen him pop up in the news this year because he donated his entire salary this year 0
237040	to charity 0
237680	he made a very long Twitter collage of all the times Fox news brought on celebrities to hear their opinion 0
243220	Jon Voight 0
243900	Kid Rock 0
244460	Chuck Norris 0
245200	Clint Eastwood 0
246120	and if you wanna take the time, the list goes on and on 0
248720	so why do their opinions seemingly matter, but when LeBron and Kevin talk 0
254160	no, you can play basketball 0
255460	so for Laura to have that opinion, I just feel like it's ridiculous 0
257860	but that said, of course I wanna pass the question off to you 0
260019	what are your thoughts on this? 0
261079	then let's talk about Black Panther for two reasons 0
263340	one, it is just killin' it at the box office right now 0
265720	it's estimated that it's going to make $201 million in North America over the weekend 0
269920	and internationally it's expected to make $387 million more 0
273560	ratings wise it's got 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with an audience score of 77% 0
278120	and I will say, I personally loved the movie, uh, it's a gorgeous looking movie, they, they somehow 0
281740	make me care about almost all the characters, even secondary characters 0
285000	and Michael B Jordan is a fantastic villain with a fantastic back story 0
288820	for me personally when it comes to these kind of movies, how good the movie is often depends on 0
292640	the bad guy 0
293360	like some comic book movies can power through not having a really good bad guy 0
297040	like Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel like it's had a bad guy problem 0
299840	but you just watch the first movie, it's just so fun, like the, the main five are so great 0
303400	and with Black Panther, Michael B Jordan just kills it at being Kill Monger 0
307100	that said, I can understand people's criticisms about certain things 0
309400	like the green screen 0
310440	some, some pacing issues depending on your personal preference 0
313540	predictability, but then you could argue it's about the ride 0
315580	so there's that side of it, but then there was also the fake news side of it 0
318620	over the last few days, some social media users have claimed that they were attacked while going to screenings 0
322720	of Black Panther 0
323380	and these people claim the attacks were racially motivated 0
325580	most of the photos include photos of people bruised, bloody, after these alleged beatings 0
329220	we'll take a look at some of the tweets 0
330400	for example 0
351760	and there are more and more posts 0
352720	but you get the example 0
353540	that said, if you, if you are familiar with the Rob Porter story that we talked about 0
357360	uh, you know that was Rob Porter's wife in one of those pictures 0
359740	or if you're a fan of Supernatural, you know that this is Jenson Akles 0
362680	and some of the other photos included real photos from other assaults 0
365840	this particular one happened in Sweeden about a month ago 0
368040	and Twitter's tried to stop the spread of all these false reports 0
370440	they've suspended some of the accounts 0
371620	but if you go online right now, there's still people spreading this fake news 0
374700	and while this is disgusting to me because people are spreading fake news to further the racial divides 0
378840	in this country 0
379800	it's also extremely disrespectful and disgusting because they're using real victims 0
384240	people's horrible moments being exploited to push a racist agenda 0
387560	and that's the end of this story, I just wanted to make people aware 0
389540	of this fake news 0
390660	and if you're aunts and uncles are sharing this because they didn't look into it 0
393960	and it just kind of furthers what they think about the world 0
396400	hit em with that truth 0
397340	they'll reject it, but still you'll know you're in the right 0
399680	but from that, I wanna share some stuff I loved today in Today in Awesome 1
403220	brought to you by Postmates 1
404300	Postmates of course the fantastic delivery on demand app 1

409160	boom, open up the app, they will deliver it to your home, your office, your wherever 1
412540	with the lack of free time I have these days, it has become vital to my life 1
415620	I highly recommend it 1

420040	download the app, enter promo code PHILLYD 1
422320	and they will give you $100 in free delivery credit 1
424320	and the first bit of awesome is just a recommendation 0
426440	in the past I've recommended movies like Train to Busan, I've recommended series like 11 22 63 0
431040	uh, Handmaid's Tale 0
432780	uh, Future Man 0
433680	but something I haven't done in a very long time is to recommend a video game 0
436960	and that is finally coming to an end 0
438840	if you're looking for a fun, enjoyable game that makes you feel like you earned your wins 0
442120	and also if you wanna go that far, has an extremely high skill level 0
446180	I cannot recommend the game Celeste enough 0
448960	you can play it on Steam, the Nintendo Switch, the PS4, theXBox1 0
452120	it also has a fantastic soundtrack, one that I love so much, I actually listen to that while I research stories 0
457380	and of course, are there better games in the world? 0
458940	yes, but this is one of the last ones that just kind of fell in front of me 0
462220	and I just wanted to share it 0
463620	then we had other awesome including the director of Black Panther, Brian Coogler 0
466960	kind of just walking us through a fight scene 0
469140	more Slo Mo Guys awesome 0
470620	we had Life Noggin asking which animal is the smartest 0
473020	and if you wanna see the full versions of everything I just shared, the secret link of the day 0
475940	anything at all, links as always are in the description down below 0
478960	and then let's talk about the fall out from the Parkland Florida school shooting 0
481720	this mass shooting of course involving a former student bringing an AR-15 to the school 0
485700	killing 17, injuring many others 0
487940	and many people were looking for who to blame other than just the shooter 0
490860	of course there's a conversation to be had around gun laws, specifically what you can have 0
494520	background checks, things like that 0
496280	right, people asking questions like why is it that in Florida you have to be 21 years old 0
500240	you have to go through a 3 day background check to get a hand gun 0
502740	but if you opt instead to buy an AR-15, seemingly a much more deadly weapon 0
506040	you only have to be 18 years old and you just go in, if you, if you pass a quickie background check 0
510420	you're gonna be out in minutes 0
511500	but at the same time, you had people placing blame elsewhere 0
513640	you had Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast blaming who he called the biggest pusher of violence 0
518140	what do we do with the biggest pusher of violence, the biggest pusher of violence is hands down 0
525540	Hollywood movies, hands down the video game market 0
528980	when you look at Call of Duty, when you look at movies like John Wick 0
533080	the societal impacts of people being desensitized to killing in ways that are different than 0
538840	how somebody that was on the battlefield was desensitized is troubling 0
542560	also it's important to note, Brian Mast is not alone 0
545300	we had Matt Bevin, he's a Republican Governor from Kentucky, he's endorsed by the NRA 0
549080	and he said this 0
549880	and then you look at the culture of death that is being celebrated 0
554440	there are video games that yes are listed for mature audiences, but kids play them and everybody knows it 0
560600	and there's nothing to prevent the child from playing them 0
563220	it celebrates the slaughtering of peop- there are games that literally replicate 0
568680	and give people the ability to score points for doing the very same things that these students are doing 0
574340	inside of schools 0
575540	where you get extra points for finishing someone off 0
578220	who's lying there begging for their life 0
580300	these are quote unquote video games and they're forced down our throats under the guise of protected speech 0
587300	it's garbage 0
588120	it's the same as pornography 0
589600	we also had people like CNN political commentator hitting some of these same notes 0
592780	but then also blaming rap music 0
594320	we have a culture thing here that we're not discussing, I mean when I, when I grew up, it was 0
598120	Andy Griffith, you never had school shootings, and we still had prayer in school 0
601800	and we drove to school with guns in the, in the car 0
604740	I say we, I would see students that did that 0
606920	today we are at a different time when the me- not the media but movie industry, the rap industry 0
612900	radio in general talks about these things that 0
615900	are common now and we have almost desensitized them 0
619080	and it's incredibly annoying to me that I have to say the same thing that I have to say every time some politician 0
623500	decides to blame movies and video games and rap music 0
626340	every time after a tragedy like this 0
628540	the research doesn't back that up 0
629940	like with any topic, if you search long enough, you can find a site or some research that says what you think 0
634040	right, there are studies on both sides that say, you know, video games do cause people to be violent 0
638440	no they don't 0
639160	but if you look at a lot of the newer research, those using better methods, you find that there, there's very minimal 0
644060	if any connection whatsoever to violent video games and violence in real life 0
648020	it also seemingly doesn't answer the question why these other countries that have violent video games 0
651780	and, and rap music and violent movies 0
654160	why they don't have simliar issues 0
655640	and pretty much anyone that has ever played a game where you kill someone 0
658820	will tell you it did not make them go 'yeah, I'll do this in real life now' 0
661760	right? 0
662260	and to like a lesser degree, when I played Pokemon, it didn't make me go 0
664780	you know, it'd be great to just make animals fight each other for my entertainment 0
668160	and to me it's just a ridiculous argument, I get why people believe it 0
670820	be- especially if they haven't played games, because it offers a simple solution 0
674180	an explination 0
674960	but just, no 0
675760	what these people are saying is backed by their feelings and their beliefs 0
678660	but not by facts 0
679540	and it's really disgusting to me that these three would run what I would just see as a distraction campaign 0
684280	we have a real problem in this country and we need to have a conversation to come up with solutions 0
687360	and on the note of finding solutions, we of course have to ask the question of where do we get the solutions 0
691920	we can look to the White House, but the situation seems iffy at best 0
694460	we have seen the president talk about this being a mental health problem 0
696980	we've seen him praise local law enforcement 0
699240	we also saw him tweet over the weekend 0
711220	and this is connected to a story I want to talk about much more later this week 0
714220	and that is the indictment of 13 Russians, 3 Russian nationals 0
716940	Trump's response to the 37 page indictment was 'hey this proves there was no collusion,we're vindicated' 0
721300	this because the indictment read 0
725540	but also on that note, you had people noting that this is not the end of Muller's investigation 0
729860	and this indictment seems to be just one facet of the Russian situation 0
733160	this being the specific situation of organized Russians trying to cause chaos online using social media 0
738140	but like I said, I wanna do a deeper dive on that later this week 0
740420	and I just wanted to give you some background context for that tweet 0
742960	and with that background understood, it appears the president is saying becuse the FBI 0
746340	was focused on Russia, that is why procedure wasn't followed when the FBI was warned 0
750320	about the shooter in this incident in January 0
752560	so we had that version of the president on Twitter over the weekend, and then this morning 0
756260	Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said this 0
771340	so that does seem like a positive, pro gun, anti gun people I talked to, most are still onboard 0
775980	with better background checks 0
777080	that said, when you glance at the main version of this bill that people talk about, there doesn't seem to be anything 0
781500	in this bill that would've stopped this Parkland Florida shooting 0
784040	and for some background, this was called the Fix the NICS Act, it was later merged 0
787300	with the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 0
790040	it actually passed the House last year 0
791640	it's currently in the Senate 0
792680	it's also supported by the NRA 0
794140	and reportedly 0
798800	this including convicted criminals, people who were dishonorably discharged 0
802100	and understandably the bill was built this way because it came after Southerland Springs 0
805880	that you might remember is the Texas shooting that resulted in 26 people being killed 0
809960	here's the thing, this actually wouldn't've stopped the Parkland shooter 0
812500	he did pass an NICS background check 0
814580	he wasn't a convicted criminal 0
816040	he wasn't dishonorably discharged 0
817800	and as far as who's speaking out the most and the loudest about what to do next, it's actually the 0
821940	survivors of the school shooting 0
823540	on Saturday we saw students from Marjory Stowman Douglass High School holding a rally 0
826820	they gathered together to protest current gun laws, speak out in the wake of last week's shooting 0
830600	the 5 that you have likely seen at this point 0
832400	you have David Hogg, Alex Winn, Cameron Kasky, Jaclyn Corin, and Emma Gonzalez 0
836860	and Emma Gonzlez has become one of the main faces of this movement thanks to a speech 0
840420	that she gave over the weekend that has just blown up 0
842880	where she took aim at politicians and then specifically Trump 0
845500	if the president wants to come up to me 0
847400	and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy 0
850000	and how it should never have happened 0
852080	and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it 0
856240	I'm gonna happily ask him how much money he received from the National Riffle Association 0
861000	(cheering) 0
862020	it doesn't matter because I already know 0
865300	$30 million dollars 0
867480	politicians who sit in their guilded house and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling 0
873000	us nothing could've ever been done to prevent this 0
875240	we call BS 0
876960	(cheering) 0
880220	we say that- they say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence 0
885140	we call BS 0
887460	they say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun 0
891160	we call BS 0
893520	they say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars 0
898240	we call BS 0
900840	no 0
901340	they say that no laws could've been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occured 0
906940	we call BS 0
909240	that us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand 0
914000	how the government works 0
916120	we call BS 0
918420	if you agree, register to vote, contact your local congress people 0
922920	give them a piece of your mind 0
924860	(cheering) 0
925660	the students have also announced a march on Washington that will call for stricter gun laws 0
929100	they're calling it the March for Our Lives 0
930840	it is set for March 24th 0
932360	the march's mission statement reading 0
943460	separate from this, we've also seen students planning walk outs 0
946280	the first of these is planned for March 14th, exactly one month after last week's shooting 0
950140	the walk out will reportedly happen at 10 am, last 17 minutes, one minute per person who was killed 0
954600	there's also a second walk out that's planned for April 20th 0
957100	I, I've seen people criticizing it saying oh kids, 420 0
960540	no, that's not what it's about 0
961940	April 20th is actually the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting 0
965100	the walk out there is also scheduled for 10 am but it's scheduled to last the rest of the day 0
968660	this morning we also saw a protest take place 0
970540	17 teenagers from a group called Teens for Gun Reform laid down on the ground outside the White House 0
975320	there they stayed motionless for 3 minutes to symbolize how long they say it took the shooter to purchase the AR-15 0
980260	that he used to kill the students and teachers last week 0
982380	and ultimately that is where we are right now 0
983880	and it's going to be very interesting to see how this situation evolves 0
986520	and I mean that in two respects 0
988140	one: will anything actually happen with laws around guns 0
991400	and two: this is an election year 0
993360	and understandably this is going to be a key campaign issue 0
995640	so will that mean that something actually does change so that people can say 'hey, look, we, we were a part of progress' 0
1001280	or will it incentivize those on the right to maybe not budge because they're worried about re-election 0
