20	Sup you beautiful bastards! 0
1740	Hope you're having a fantastic 0
2649	Tuesday, Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it. 0
6260	And the first thing I want to talk about today because 0
8249	there's so much negativity in the news is a 0
10500	Positive story 0
12520	a positive story about my new personal hero Elizabeth Swaney. 0
14420	Elizabeth Swaney's a 33 year old American woman. 0
16949	She's been freestyle skiing since 2013. She's had the goal of making the Olympics. 0
21140	And this year she did just that, she went to the Olympics 0
23279	but you may not have heard of her because she finished 0
25210	24th (last place).  This in the women's ski halfpipe 0
28480	And as far as why she ended up in last place 0
29730	It was because she really didn't attempt any tricks. 0
32430	I can't show you the video for legal reasons 0
33989	but when she would get to the top of the halfpipe where people would normally do a trick she would just then go back down. 0
39750	For her two runs she receive the scores 30 and 31.4. 0
42570	I laughed because her best score was still 13.6 points behind 23rd place 0
47040	And that was Denmark's Laila Friis-Salling 0
49520	and she slipped on both runs. So the question becomes well 0
51560	Why did Elizabeth Swaney not do any tricks and how the hell is she in the Olympics?? Well my friends it is because Elizabeth 0
57220	Swaney is a damn American hero. A woman with the very American mindset of "It doesn't matter if I'm qualified to do it 0
64660	I'm gonna figure out a way how to get there!" Elizabeth knowing she didn't have a good chance of competing with the US team originally 0
69540	Competed for Venezuela where her mother is from later switching to Hungary where her grandparents were from. 0
73980	She actually ended up becoming Hungary's first 0
75600	Olympic freestyle skier after qualifying both through the country's quota system as well as placing where she needed to place 0
80439	among 13 World Cup halfpipe contests. 0
82302	Now when you hear that she placed where she needed to place you go, oh okay, 0
85979	Well, she beat out other athletes. Not really, pretty much every event she went to she placed last or near last. 0
91170	But Elizabeth realized she could game the system. According to the rules, to qualify for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games 0
96040	athletes must record a number of top 30 finishes. 0
98610	And so what Swaney ended up doing was just going to competitions with fewer than 30 competitors! 0
103470	And so by technicality she was satisfying the requirements. 0
106740	In fact, the best Swaney has ever placed is thirteenth out of fifteen. And so she met those basic requirements 0
111899	She raised funds through online donation sites 0
114119	So she could pay for all of this. 0
115500	And according to reports there were a few competitors that had to be pulled out of the Olympics due to injury, 0
119480	there's the limit on how many skiers a single country can have in one same event, and then you pair that with some 0
124659	reallocation rules within the Hungarian Ski Federation 0
126790	designed to balance men and women's competitors and Swaney got through! Now because Swaney was able to pull this off, 0
131610	There are people that are angry and also people calling for change. A Hungarian team 0
135719	Spokesman telling Reuters 0
136940	"We, the Hungarian Olympic Committee have to learn the lessons from this case, and we must consider rethinking our 0
141500	nomination procedures." "We shall be doing this with the assistance of the appropriate experts, in the near future." 0
147260	At least one fan saying, "It's so sad to me that anyone thinks what Elizabeth Swaney did is in any way admirable. I get that it's her dream, 0
152420	but it's also a dream of the thousands of elite athletes who train endlessly. There's nothing admirable about a loophole." 0
157819	Another saying, "Terribly disrespectful, 0
159290	I'm sorry to hear someone from the USA would game the system like that, but not surprised either." 0
162920	But others like the Canadian skier Cassie Sharpe who actually who actually won 0
165620	the gold medal in the women's halfpipe final said, "If you're going to put in that time and effort to be here, 0
169159	Then you deserve to be here as much as I do. 0
170660	My official response to any Elizabeth Swaney haters out there is 0
173520	don't hate the player, hate the game. 0
175519	Elizabeth Swaney didn't make the rules, she just made the rules work for her. 0
179280	And you know what if you're looking for any advice out 0
180530	there, that there's there's a saying in 0
182189	sports that I think that people could use in their everyday lives. And that is "don't play your opponent, play the rule." 0
187639	What's in the rulebook of whatever you're doing in life? For some things like an actual sport? 0
191540	There is an actual rulebook. In life, 0
193650	You have laws. 0
194660	And if you take the time to actually look at the rules unlike other people who are just gonna rely on things 0
199360	Like raw talent, and you give yourself an advantage or at the very least like in this situation a way in where otherwise there would not have 0
205300	been one. So Elizabeth Swaney, from one hustler to another, I salute you. 0
208700	Then let's talk about the situation around Blac 0
210400	Chyna. If you're not familiar with Blac Chyna, she's a former stripper, model, turned reality star 0
215600	Overall seemingly a person that's famous for no reason. You might have seen yesterday that she was trending all over Twitter 0
220300	And it was because there was a one-minute video of her performing oral sex on at that time an unidentified man. Now as of right now 0
226500	It's unclear who posted the first video, Blac Chyna and her lawyers say they're already asking the police to investigate the leak. At this time 0
231709	She has not made any public statements, 0
233209	but her attorneys are speaking out. One of her lawyers, Lisa Bloom writing on Twitter yesterday: 0
236840	"Revenge porn -- posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse. 0
242680	It's also a way to try to slut-shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It's not a joke." 0
248620	It's actually that part of the story and the general reaction 0
250759	I saw online that made me want to talk about this story. Because online the number one reaction to this video was an outrage. It 0
256579	was making fun of Blac Chyna for being bad at giving head. I mean this video guy leaked and just seven minutes later 0
261949	It was memes galore. 0
263280	We also saw a lot of people addressing the issue of the leak saying China has no reason to be upset because she agreed to be 0
268319	video taped, so she shouldn't be upset if it leaked. And we've talked about this before I'll say it again 0
271800	And it's not white knighting it is just stating the facts, 0
275180	It is a consent issue. Just because you do something that makes it possible for someone to do something 0
279360	horrible to you does it make it okay? 0
281420	Like if you give someone a key to your house you 0
283330	trust this person and then maybe things go bad and then that person gives copies of your keys out. It's not okay 0
288930	you didn't give them permission. If you decide to film yourself in a sexual situation with one other person 0
293000	That's a just for you thing! 0
294479	You're not consenting to the entirety of the internet seeing it. It can happen 0
298169	which is why I advise if you're not okay with it never film anything like this 0
302700	but that doesn't put the woman or the person that is the victim in this situation in the wrong. 0
306960	I just think that in general 0
307520	It's important to remember that whether whether it be a reality star or whether it be someone 0
312030	maybe you don't like, when something illegal happens to someone we 0
315280	Shouldn't just cheer it on. We shouldn't  make fun of the victim. Also at the same time, I kind of want to say anyone 0
319889	that's ever faked leaks in the past for free promotion 0
323429	which is essentially faking a crime. Fuck those people! 0
326320	Because their actions in the past have trained people to just believe that this is all part 0
330099	of the PR site. 0
331740	That said, for this specific story we now have Blac Chyna's 0
333700	Ex-boyfriend Mechi coming forward saying he's actually the unidentified guy in the video. He's reportedly angry 0
338159	he said he's never possessed the video that it was taken on Blac Chyna's phone. As of right now who posted the video 0
342840	we don't know, a lot of people have been pointing to Rob 0
345009	Kardashian. This because he posted private photos of Blac Chyna on the internet before on all his own social media. 0
350250	And so that's where we are as of right now around this specific story 0
352860	We'll see if there's anything that comes from the police investigation 1
355320	but it was less about the 1
357540	specifics and more about the just grand scheme that I wanted to talk about. 1
360760	From that I want to share some stuff 1
362040	I love today and today in awesome brought to you by probably one of the most requested shirts we've had in a year. 1
368009	Today we are releasing the "why be informed when you can use your feelings as your facts?" shirt! Perfect shirt for people that are tired of 1
373468	arguing with people who are using their feelings as facts, and/or the perfect gift for the favorite family member or family members on your 1
380070	Facebook Timeline throwing out bullshit! They'll probably wear it not realizing you're talking shit on them. 1
384000	So if you want to snag one while you can, jump on this with this first run of this shirt link down below (shopdefranco.com). 1
388680	The first bit of have awesome. It's just cuz I'm still on a Michael B 0
391199	Jordan kick right now, Complex posted a video going sneaker shopping with Michael B. Jordan. 0
395300	Then we had Seeker covering why do we taste sour flavors? 0
398360	We had Marvel releasing a video announcing fresh starts for 2018 a new creative team, new series, new directions, new beginnings. 0
404810	Hopefully there's some awesome in that. And we got the honest trailer for Justice League. 0
407990	We've got the Slow Mo Guys putting out rubber wrecking ball in 4k, got a new trailer for season two of Jessica Jones, 0
413120	And if you want to see the full versions everything I just shared, the secret link of the day, anything at all 0
417300	links as always in the description down below. Then, in potentially big news around gun laws and gun 0
422040	regulation: Donald Trump spoke about bump stocks today. "After the deadly shooting in Las Vegas 0
427010	I directed Attorney General to clarify whether certain bump stock 0
432500	devices like the one used in Las Vegas 0
436260	are illegal under current law. That process began in December and 0
442590	Just a few moments ago, 0
445350	I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General 0
449820	to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns. 0
457530	I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, 0
462120	Jeff, very soon." So potential change in coming it'll be interesting to see what the debate in Congress looks like, 0
467450	But there's not much for me to add here because this literally happened after I was done with the show 0
471680	but I wanted to make sure we included it. That said whether you're pro-gun anti-gun 0
474590	I'd love to know your thoughts on this specific topic. Then and potentially the sexiest story of the day today. Today let's talk about 0
480660	gerrymandering. ;) 0
482580	Fuck was that? Yes gerrymandering. Try and keep it together as we talk about congressional district maps okay? 0
488810	I mean seriously if someone's not listening with headphones 0
491550	Someone's gonna come by. Enough of that! In June of 2017 a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Pennsylvania congressional district map was infringing on 0
498380	constitutional rights of voters according to the state constitution. 0
500680 0
501180	This due to partisan gerrymandering. And for those new to the topic of gerrymandering, the 0
505080	definition of gerrymandering is to "divide (a 0
507300	territorial unit) into election districts to give one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts while 0
513240	concentrating the voting strength of the opposition in as few districts as possible." 0
516840	Long story short what it ends up doing is it fucks with the proper representation 0
520340	of a state. When you look at how some of the districts were carved up to favor Republicans 0
524760	It doesn't even look like they were trying to hide it. Like look at this one 0
527720	This is a real district in Pennsylvania. It's nicknamed Goofy kicking Donald Duck. 0
532080	And it's districts being carved up like that that resulted in Republicans holding 13 out of the 18 congressional districts in the state. 0
537240	Despite statewide voting being closer to 50/50. Now on January 22nd of this year the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state's congressional 0
543930	district map was 0
545310	unconstitutional. That decision stating that the map clearly plainly and palpably violates the Constitution the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 0
551360	The ruling gave lawmakers until February 9th to create a new district map saying if they do not by then the court welcomed all 0
557280	parties and intervenors to submit maps. After this we saw members of the state GOP enter an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, the 0
563210	Court rejected that request, and though the court didn't explicitly state 0
566030	why, some speculate it was because the decision considered the state constitution instead of the federal one. 0
570470	Then we get the big news yesterday the Pennsylvania Supreme Court announces the new map using 0
574500	population and geographical compactness to redraw the districts. The decision stating that no revised map was agreed upon by the 0
580220	legislature, 0
580800	So it fell to the court. Ultimately what we see with this new map was it makes seven competitive GOP held districts more 0
585600	Democratic. Three of the districts that Trump won by more than 20% could actually be competitive in the midterm, 0
589940	and what we could expect to maybe see is four to six of the seats switching to the Democrats favor. And the court decision instructs 0
594740	the 2018 election to use this new map and candidates have until March 20th to register for the primary. Now of course as expected there 0
600500	were a lot of reactions to this news. 0
602040	Pennsylvania Governor and Democrat Tom Wolf saying, "I applaud the court for their decision and I respect their effort to remedy Pennsylvania's unfair and unequal 0
608400	congressional elections." Former attorney General Eric Holder and the chairman of the National Democratic 0
612380	Redistricting committee said the new map is "A major victory in the fight against gerrymandering in 0
616820	Pennsylvania and around the country." At the same time we had House Speaker Mike Turzai, Senate President pro tempore 0
621380	Joe Scarnati, both Republicans saying in a joint statement, 0
624420	"Implementation of this map would create a constitutional crisis where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is usurping the authority of the legislative and executive branches." 0
630900	Also calling the decision  "the ultimate partisan gerrymander, one brought about by the Democrat governor acting in concert with liberal politically connected 0
637680	litigants." 0
638180	And we also heard from President Trump who tweeted "Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania 0
641730	challenge the new "pushed" Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! 0
647120	Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!" And ultimately I'm of the mindset of 0
652100	The closer we can get to proper representation when it comes to voting, the better. I hate 0
656140	that this has somehow become partisan politics, both parties in the past have been guilty of gerrymandering. The Republicans just 0
662080	did a fantastic job over the past decade. And once again like with the Elizabeth Swaney situation, 0
665830	there is part of me that appreciates playing that rule book hard. 0
669310	But unlike in The Swaney situation, it ultimately results in the taking away of someone's voice. Somewhat the effectiveness of someone's vote. 0
674920	There's no reason than when you look to Pennsylvania, which is a very 50/50 state that the breakdown in districts should be 13 to 18. 0
681500	50% does not equal 72%. 0
683780	Even if it was like a split of ten Republican seats and eight Democrat seats, then it could be like okay well 0
687940	that's just the way the split went, but here 0
689620	It's so obvious. What I would like to remind the Republicans who were against this redistricting is that 0
694240	sometimes you end up creating your own future problems. People's opinions change, 0
698260	they evolve, 0
699360	different people come into power, 0
700840	different people will be able to pull the same tricks as you. One of the instances that comes to mind is when we look back 0
705430	to 2013. The Senate Democrats they pulled that nuclear option, only need 50 votes 0
709960	and then they lost their damn mind when the Republicans did it last year. 0
713740	That's also probably gonna fall on deaf ears because for most politicians 0
716200	It's all about the net. Actually on the note of only thinking about them now 0
719350	I want to talk about Donald Trump and Mitt Romney. 0
721360	Because in the past week Mitt Romney announced that he's going to be running for a Senate seat in Utah. Yesterday 0
725410	we saw the president tweet "Mitt Romney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful state of Utah. 0
729400	He will make a great senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, 0
731710	and has my full support and endorsement!" Mitt Romney responding "Thank You Mr. President for the support. 0
735520	I hope that over the course of the campaign 0
736900	I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah." 0
739250	And understandably people from both sides were kind of surprised by this. One, because since 0
743480	2016 Mitt Romney has said stuff like this about Donald Trump Donald Trump. "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. 0
749000	His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the members of the American public for suckers. 0
755360	he gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat." And I've seen some people say well of 0
760600	course he's going to say "Thank you!" 0
762010	Why why would he cause a fire? And to that people pointed out that once again in 0
765740	2016 Mitt Romney tweeted "If Trump had said four years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims Mexicans, 0
771440	disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement." Now as of early 2018 it appears Mitt 0
776290	Romney's of a different mind, which is strange considering in 0
779180	2017 he criticized the president around Nazis. Donald Trump of course that is his infamous both sides comment after Charlottesville. Mitt Romney 0
785680	responded "No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes." 0
792180	Also, maybe this is a super recent change because January 15, 2018 0
795360	he criticized the president, writing "The poverty of an aspiring 0
798100	immigrant's nation of origin is as irrelevant as their race. The sentiment attributed to POTUS is 0
802179	inconsistent w/ America's history and antithetical to American values." And here's the thing, I don't care if you're Pro Trump 0
806790	You were one of the never Trump errs, which Mitt Romney appeared to be back in the day? 0
810339	How do you trust Mitt Romney? Because if you're anti Trump it appears that Mitt Romney who has been so outspoken against Trump has finally 0
816269	Bent the knee, he's kissing the ring, and if you're Pro Trump. He seems like a wolf in sheep's clothing. 0
821290	He's just going to do this to secure the vote and then he's not gonna be on Trump's team when he's in the Senate. 0
826110	And I also wonder if this is part of Mitt 0
827429	Romney's strategy, because that was something that seemingly helped Donald Trump during the 2016 election. 0
832529	I knew a good number of people that when they looked at Trump. They were like no he's just trying to trick Republicans. 0
837420	He's just saying big crazy shit like that wall so they're on board, but he's when he gets in there 0
842910	he's gonna switch it up. 0
843779	He's our Trojan horse, so it's not crazy to think that the Republicans who have been anti Trump thinking oh okay, 0
848309	Mitt Romney's our Trojan horse. Honestly who knows? He's a career politician who knows where he lies? That said, 0
853800	that's where I'm gonna end today's show of course. This is the Philip DeFranco Show, I give you the news 0
857519	I give you my opinion, and then I want to hear from you. 0
