24140	 McDonalds is everywhere. In the continental United States, the most mumbled from the MD may be 0
29599	 at this place in the National Shelter Archive for Shelton in Nevada. Even then you have to travel 0
34800	 only 115 miles (185 km) to the nearest wings. There are more than 36,000 in the world 0
41660	 places in 119 different countries. One of McDonalds' defining features 0
47550	 is the brand's permanence. While there are regional differences 0
52370	 in the menu, such as Kiwi Burger in New Zealand or Chicken Kanji in Indonesia, the main menu 0
57730	 such as Big Mac, Chicken Nuggets and Fried Potatoes have them everywhere. This means that 0
62910	 the same things are done in the same way with the same products in very different ways 0
67550	 economies around the world. Obviously, BigMaks do not have the same price everywhere. One BM 0
73710	 it costs an average of $ 4.79 in the US, but if they take the equivalent in Kenya, 480 0
79470	 shilling, no one will buy it because it's double the salary. Whatever 0
84080	 to pay $ 200 for BM in the US. That's why McDonald's puts the price on it 0
89430	 of burgers based on many factors such as labor, rent, product costs 0
94450	 and local wages. Now a little true economy. Purchasing power is the number 0
99280	 products that can be bought with a unit of currency. Let me explain. In the US the average price 0
104939	 BM on all markets is $ 4.79. In Sweden, the BM price is 44 kronor. 0
111409	 The 44 kroner is the equivalent of $ 5.13. This means that in the US you can get $ 1 0
119500	 20.8% of BM, while in Sweden you can get only 19.5% of BM. According to BM 0
125110	 the purchasing power of USD is higher. You can get more for the money 0
130570	 yours. This also means that the Swedish krona is overestimated by about 6.1% 0
134950	 at least according to the BigMac Index. The Economist magazine has done 0
140880	 this index in 1986 as a fun way to compare buyer power between currencies. Let me now 0
147570	 to see the numbers. In Venezuela, the cost of BigMac is $ 0.66 - that's it 0
153540	 the cheapest BigMac in equivalent dollars in the world. That's because of 0
158290	 rapid currency falls and high inflation in the country. It's waiting 0
163010	 the price of the Venezuelan BM to jump in response. This means that with 0
167650	 the money for one US BM can buy 7 Venezuelan. After Venezuela 0
173900	 countries with the cheapest BigMac are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa and Malaysia. 0
179069	 On the other hand, the most expensive BigMakers come from Switzerland 0
184019	 Sweden, Norway, USA and Denmark. That's true, the US is home to the fourth most expensive 0
190959	 BM in the world. It is also interesting to see for how long one 0
195819	 one will get enough money for a BM in different cities around the world. In Nauru, Kenya 0
201819	 the average worker must work 173 minutes to pay for a BM. 0
207370	 Compare with Hong Kong, where you need to robotic only 8.7 min for 0
212409	 burger. You can get a Burger in Miami where you have to 0
216970	 you only work 10.7 min for BigMac. Tossy index is not 0
222390	 perfect. While the cost of products is almost the same everywhere, because 0
226190	 all products are one standard, the index does not see big differences 0
230780	 in price of land and labor. A burger will cost less in India because McDonald's 0
235769	 you do not have to pay much for place and workers. However, this index 0
241080	 is a great way to learn a basic economy in a delicious way. 0
