30	moon colonization is something that 0
1770	humans have dreamt about for centuries 0
3240	and it's entirely possible it's just a 0
6060	matter of cost bringing both humans and 0
8400	supplies the two hundred and thirty-four 0
9990	thousand miles the lunar surface costs 0
12300	an enormous amount of money and it's 0
13950	difficult to justify the cost of 0
15599	taxpayers so how much would it cost well 0
18330	that's a complicated question for the 0
20010	sake of simplicity let's say we're doing 0
21539	a one-year return mission with four 0
23369	astronauts using NASA technology 0
25380	the first thing we'll calculate is the 0
27119	cost of getting there and we'll need a 0
28590	rocket the Saturn 5 is the only rocket 0
31140	to have ever existed that is powerful 0
32969	enough to take humans beyond low Earth 0
34559	orbit the problem is all 15 of them are 0
37110	long retired the Saturn 5 had a lunar 0
39390	payload capacity of 90,000 pounds and a 0
41969	per launch cost of a hundred and eighty 0
43829	nine million 1971 dollars or 1 billion 0
46410	123 million 2016 dollars which works out 0
49590	to $12,500 per pound transported to the 0
52800	moon that may seem like a lot but that 0
54719	would mean that the average American 0
56039	winged 159 pounds could travel to the 0
58559	moon on technology that existed when 0
60390	computers looked like this for a mere 0
62309	two million dollars I know you know that 0
64799	that's not right there are two problems 0
66810	in that calculation first off that 0
68909	doesn't include research and development 0
70380	costs a staggering 6.4 billion dollars 0
73320	was spent to develop the Saturn 5 which 0
75210	is 38 billion in 2016 dollars so 0
78509	considering that the Saturn 5 was 0
80400	launched 13 times that works out to just 0
82560	over 4 billion dollars per launch or 44 0
85110	thousand dollars per pound but to 0
87240	colonize the moon you don't just need to 0
89070	get things to the moon you need to get 0
91049	them on the moon the budget allocated to 0
93509	develop and build 12 lunar landers back 0
95520	in the Apollo days was 18 billion 2016 0
98250	dollars or 1.5 billion dollars per 0
100530	Lander once again the lunar landers are 0
102630	no longer in service so we're including 0
104460	the R&amp;D costs in our calculations we 0
106799	need two Landers to bring our four 0
108270	astronauts to the moon and these have to 0
109890	be able to return so they need to land 0
111420	with both the launch systems and fuel so 0
113820	that's 1.5 billion per Lander plus 4 0
115979	billion per saturn v launch so 11 0
118079	billion total to carry our astronauts to 0
119969	the moon and back during the Apollo days 0
121710	NASA also developed a module called the 0
123930	LM truck which was designed to deliver 0
125790	payloads to the surface of the Moon 0
127439	without a crew not only could these land 0
129449	with 11,000 pounds of car 0
131550	but a Saturn 5 rocket could launch with 0
133739	two of them using the truck we can bring 0
135900	our per pound cost of bringing cargo to 0
137970	the lunar surface down to a reasonable 0
139739	three hundred and eighteen thousand 0
141360	dollars believe it or not that's a 0
143190	bargain so once our four astronauts get 0
145950	to the moon they need somewhere to live 0
147510	the Center for Strategic and 0
149040	International Studies in Washington DC 0
151080	did a super detailed study on how much 0
153269	the development and construction of a 0
154980	lunar base would cost for our 0
156510	four-person base it would cost twenty 0
158730	billion dollars to develop plus one of 0
160380	our four billion-dollar launches 0
161819	equaling twenty four billion that's a 0
163950	little steep for a budget option we 0
165870	could go with something like big low air 0
167220	spaces be three thirty spacecraft these 0
169380	are essentially inflatable buildings 0
171030	that work in space and with a bit of 0
172709	modification they could conceivably be 0
174630	altered to work on the surface of the 0
175980	Moon Bigelow airspace is a commercial 0
178019	company they've said that the be three 0
179549	thirty would rent out for 1.25 million 0
181560	dollars per day or four hundred sixty 0
183330	five million dollars for our one-year 0
184920	mission concerning that's the first time 0
186810	I've said million when talking about a 0
188250	current day cost that's practically 0
190140	nothing until you consider the problem 0
192180	of getting the be three thirty to the 0
193680	moon 0
194040	it weighs forty three thousand pounds so 0
196470	it takes four LM truck landings and to 0
198510	Saturn five launches for a total of 0
200250	fourteen billion dollars well that's a 0
202709	little better than 24 billion let's move 0
205079	on to food for food the best but not 0
207630	simplest solution is to just grow it one 0
209850	lunar greenhouse developed by the 0
211290	University of Arizona could produce 0
212790	about 5.5 pounds of food per day in 0
215609	order to have variety NASA would 0
217230	probably choose a few different crops 0
218880	that would do well on the moon for our 0
220859	calculations will say that the 0
222239	greenhouse would be filled with 76% 0
223709	sweet potato 16 percent tomato and 10 0
226170	percent strawberry that'll come out to 0
227880	4.3 pounds of sweet potato point eight 0
229950	pounds of tomato and point four pounds 0
231840	of strawberries per day sweet potatoes 0
233760	have 389 calories per pound or 1675 0
237420	calories per day per greenhouse the 0
239700	tomatoes and strawberries will make 0
240959	sixty five and sixty calories per day 0
242730	per greenhouse respectively so that's 0
244590	1800 calories per day per greenhouse 0
246750	total each of our four astronauts would 0
248670	need about three thousand calories per 0
250109	day equaling 12,000 total per day so 0
252480	we'll need six point six seven 0
253560	greenhouses total and since you can't 0
255180	really bring two-thirds of greenhouse 0
256500	we'll bring seven and have surplus food 0
258238	which is great for backup each lunar 0
259890	greenhouse will require a point two 0
261450	pounds of fertilizer 0
262300	per day which adds up to 1.4 pounds of 0
264430	fertilizer per day for our seven 0
265900	greenhouses and 510 pounds for the year 0
268120	so for the greenhouses growing scheme 0
270190	we'll need to physically bring the 0
271539	greenhouses which each weigh a full 0
273370	metric ton or 2200 pounds which for the 0
276490	seven of them is fifteen thousand four 0
278259	hundred pounds or four point nine 0
279729	billion dollars plus another one hundred 0
281620	and sixty two million dollars for 0
283000	fertilizer the international space 0
285039	station is a really good example of how 0
286840	water resources could be managed on the 0
288610	moon every bit used on the ISS is 0
290770	recycled that includes water from 0
292509	condensation showers sweat and yes urine 0
295840	it of course gets filtered heavily but 0
297969	the water and astronauts food is the 0
299620	same that came from you know other stuff 0
302259	nASA says that without water recycling 0
304960	forty thousand pounds of water would be 0
307330	needed to sustain for astronauts on the 0
309069	moon that would cost twelve point seven 0
311020	billion dollars to transport with water 0
313300	recycling we can bring that down to five 0
315219	thousand one hundred and ten pounds of 0
316870	water for the year except we have our 0
318819	greenhouse quite a bit of water is 0
320530	needed to grow the plants six thousand 0
322569	nine hundred and twenty pounds worth to 0
323949	be specific that's twelve thousand 0
325930	thirty pounds of water for the year 0
327699	which would cost three point eight to 0
329380	five billion dollars to bring so next we 0
332319	need air as an oxygen to breathe a human 0
335409	at moderate activity levels needs one 0
337180	point eight five pounds of oxygen per 0
338889	day so that means we need seven point 0
340569	four pounds of oxygen per day for our 0
342400	four astronauts 2701 pounds of the year 0
345159	which would cost eight hundred and sixty 0
346659	million dollars but wait because of our 0
348669	greenhouses and the amazing process of 0
350710	photosynthesis we don't one lunar 0
353020	greenhouse produces 0.75 pounds of 0
355029	oxygen per day so our seven create five 0
357460	point two five pounds of oxygen each day 0
359500	so we only need to bring two point one 0
361419	five pounds of oxygen per day or 785 0
364150	pounds for the year which will cost a 0
365860	mere two hundred and fifty million 0
367210	dollars you may ask why we don't use an 0
369190	oxygen scrubber and the simple answer is 0
371020	that it would cost quite a bit more to 0
372759	develop build and deliver a scrubber 0
374500	capable of creating enough clean air for 0
376569	a crew of four it's just cheaper and 0
378279	less risky to bring all the necessary 0
380080	oxygen there in terms of power it's been 0
382659	proposed that the best way to bring 0
383949	electricity to the moon is to literally 0
385659	bring a nuclear reactor it'd be a little 0
387879	one but it would carry out fission 0
389770	reactions on the surface of the moon 0
391360	nASA has only proposed not developed 0
393909	this system but they said it could be 0
395320	developed fly 0
396160	tested and delivered to the moon for 0
397720	only 1.4 billion dollars now we have 0
400660	everything we need so to answer the 0
402880	question you came here for how much 0
404500	would it cost to live a year on the moon 0
406300	I'll just say before giving my answer 0
408430	that these were all estimates and far 0
410380	from perfect for example it's likely 0
412630	that if NASA ever actually colonized the 0
414670	moon it would be decades in the future 0
416200	when commercial space companies are far 0
418510	more developed and the cost of transport 0
420220	would be much less spaceflight 0
421900	Industries already sells cargo space to 0
423940	lunar orbit for a mere 10 million 0
425830	dollars per 220 pounds with prices that 0
428170	low it may not be long until living on 0
430210	the moon and other celestial bodies 0
431800	becomes commercially advantageous 0
433360	through mining and tourism the very day 0
435640	this video goes up Elon Musk is 0
437470	anticipated to announce SpaceX is plans 0
439360	to get to Mars including a massive 0
441220	rocket they'll be able to carry as many 0
442990	as two hundred and twenty thousand 0
445030	pounds to Mars for less than any 0
447220	previous rocket which could make Martian 0
449710	colonization economically feasible so 0
452110	after adding everything up my 0
454120	conservative estimate for one year with 0
456310	four astronauts on the moon comes out to 0
458560	36 billion dollars that's 98 million per 0
462220	day 4.1 million per hour sixty eight 0
465490	thousand three hundred dollars per 0
466930	minute or 1130 eight dollars per second 0
471160	more than an average family makes in a 0
473350	year in Madagascar is it worth it 0
476140	maybe if we ever have to leave Earth 0
478540	because of the environmental change that 0
480250	we've started that 36 billion dollars 0
482530	might be the best investment we've ever 0
484540	made after all living on the Moon or 0
486850	Mars or some other celestial body is a 0
489520	crucial first step in learning how to 0
