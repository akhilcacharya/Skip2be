0	Sup You beautiful bastards hope having a fantastic 0
2800	Wednesday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it. And the first thing we're going to talk about today are 0
7980	The huge updates around the deep fake 0
10389	Situation and deep fakes if you don't remember is AI assisted porno, you it you would take a regular 0
14980	Pornographic film you would then get a ton of photos of your favorite celebrity or any other person 0
20189	And then it would look like it was that person in the porn well some of the clips looked hilariously bad the people that actually 0
25289	Took their time they used a lot of high quality footage 0
27359	It looked real some of the most popular ones included Margot Robbie Emma Watson sophie Turner and while people have been able to do something 0
33780	Similar to this for a while now it became very popular in the past year and very easy accessible 0
39090	There's an app called fake app that was created 0
40800	Where essentially you just dumped a bunch of stuff and hit a button and it would just do it for you and the update to 0
45420	The story is the ban hammers have come down after the story blew up there were many critics condemning these videos 0
50850	We saw hosting services banned them around the time we recorded the first story 0
54180	gippy cat which is one of the most popular ways to share these kind of clips banned from this because they say their Terms of 0
58920	Service allow them to remove 0
60039	objectionable content at that time 0
61440	We also saw the chat service discord cracking down on deep fake chat room and now we're seeing many 0
65920	Following their lead Tuesday a company spokesperson for pornhub said we do not tolerate any non-consensual content on the site 0
71850	And we remove all set content as soon as we are made aware of it 0
74409	Non-consensual content directly violates our Terms of Service and consists of content such as revenge porn deep fakes or anything 0
80740	Published without a person's consent or permission on that note a lot of media outlets and people online have been pointing out the deep fakes 0
86490	Can still easily be found on pornhub though celebs? 0
88979	I mentioned in the beginning of the video you know Watson Delevingne Turner Robbie Natalie Portman 0
93240	They are some of the top results. It's not like you even have to search that hard as I'm recording this video 0
96810	I literally went to the site wrote in deep fake boom there 0
99750	This doesn't look like they're enforcing it very well like several of those videos 0
102600	It's not like they were posted today this several days ago 0
104909	And it literally has the name of the thing you said you're banning in the type 0
108420	That said it just made this announcement yesterday, so I think we can give them a few days 0
111960	we also saw Twitter making a similar decision unlike other social media platforms where actually does allow adult content and tweets as long as it's 0
118079	Marked as sensitive media now 0
119670	they will suspend account suppose deep fakes are violating its intimate media policy policy that states you may not post or share intimate photos or 0
126540	videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent also since we covered this last the deep fake subreddit has blown 0
132650	Up until today 0
133530	We're rennet has now bend the subreddit saying it was due to a violation of our content policy specifically our policy against involuntary 0
140640	pornography what you've probably noticed at this point all of these sites that are self moderating seem to be doing it from the standpoint of 0
146010	Consent and that was one of the big arguments people for and against the the use of this technology in this manner has I'm saying 0
151579	It was our to create a venture parity. It's defensible by the First Amendment others saying no you're putting someone in porn 0
157670	They're not consenting to their image being used in this manner 0
159950	It's wrong and so with that said I'd love no your thoughts on this situation and all the bands that have come through I know 0
164329	that when we first covered this story there were people in three camps people saying this is horrible people saying this technology is awesome and 0
170030	Then people in between and we have an update on a story we covered back in December around doctor 0
174180	Disrespect one of the largest streamers on Twitter course came out that video near the end of the year. He broke character 0
179120	He admitted to cheating on his wife went away for a little while he then made a promo video 0
182629	And he is back and not only is he back appears 0
185030	He is bigger than ever came back this weekend at the peak of his livestream 0
187970	He had three hundred eighty nine thousand concurrent viewers 0
190370	It was a huge success or a massive viewership huge donation 0
194209	But in the midst of all this there's another controversy around doctor disrespect 0
197510	And that was pointed out by another creator by the name of Jimmy Wong Jimmy tweeting 0
200449	Here's your venerable doctor disrespect everybody clearly thought 0
203030	He crossed the line with cheating on his wife but racism guess he finds that okay and including this video 0
223500	No, I'm okay, I feel like this guy's from China right here, just tell 0
236699	Jimmy then following that up saying just like the dope Logan Paul reason this racist behavior is unacceptable and dangerous is simple young and extremely 0
243359	impressionable kids adore these 0
244680	influencers they learn their mannerism to copy them and they perpetuate them between friends at school and at others and there are many people that 0
249769	Agree with Jimmy's saying that this is racist it is for lack of a better word disrespectful 0
254239	We also saw people 0
254849	Defending these actions some saying it's just a character others saying that he's mimicking what people were doing to him pacifically you'd have Chinese players 0
261139	Coming into North American servers, and they'd just be screaming at you 0
264349	He was just mocking what he had been on the receipt, and I mentioned this update in this story for two specific reasons one 0
268880	I'd love to know your thoughts on the second part is it racist as Iran does the context protect and two based off of what? 0
274160	We've seen over the past few months if you have a scandal and it can be a very negative scandal 0
279440	It's great for your career 0
280640	I'm just waiting for someone to mix the main three that we've seen recently if you need a big bump hey 0
284870	I'm talking to you YouTube creator, which streamer you need to cheat on your wife while saying something either racially insensitive 0
290820	Or just plain out 0
292080	Racist in front of a dead body and take a little vacation come back 0
295230	Profit also for any of the stupid people passing through that is obviously a joke 0
298310	But I still want to pass the question off to you 0
300110	What is your takeaway from this whole situation from that I want to share some stuff 0
303440	I loved today and today in awesome brought to you by Phil dang 1
306680	Calm saying of course Vance has to pay what you actually use no BS fees 1
310440	admin charges contracts mobile phone service saying of course a longtime sponsor 1

318960	$23 a month for their one device and so if you want to check it out you want to see how much you could be 1

334830	Finally then you have YouTube vlogger Instagram star Will Smith 0
338510	Maybe have heard of him before he put out a video where he did a parody of his son's music video 0
343490	and it was everything I didn't know I wanted then for some reason Michael Shannon a 0
348420	Video where he put a little more than two dollars in his nose is why not and the last bit of Awesome is actually you 0
353930	Guys kind of skim over these milestones, but we just in the past week passed 6 million subscribers 0
359420	So thank you to everyone that hit the subscribe button and then didn't hit unsubscribe 0
363590	But also it's been a fantastic year for us 0
365870	I also want to thank the around 0
367500	1.5 to 2 million people who come back here every day to watch my stupid little show also a big 0
372800	Thank you to everyone that supports us over at DeFranco elite calm you are our core 0
376370	You are our safety net that said that's just a moment to appreciate the situation 0
380520	Appreciate you and then right back to work remember if you want to see the full versions everything 0
384320	I just share the secret link of the day anything at all links as always are in the description down below 0
388860	Then I want to talk about this situation with Justin Trudeau of course the the Prime Minister of Canada so there 0
394030	This moment recently at a town hall where a woman is asking him a question and this happened maternal 0
398800	Love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind 0
403220	So we'd like you to look we would like to say people kind not necessarily mankind more inclusive 0
412130	Thank you 0
412810	And your reaction to this moment was 0
414560	Mixed there were some people like those who cheered in the crowd that were like yes, and being used for all is wrong 0
419680	We should go as gender neutral as possible 0
421550	Are groups of people out there that are angry that man is used for everyone so much so that there are some women who spell? 0
427390	women with a Y at the end others saying that he was rude that he was 0
430970	Mansplaining to this woman that she should be using something that's gender-neutral 0
434770	We also had people pointing out that an old English man was actually 0
438110	Gender neutral males were known as were men females were known as women 0
441520	I will say personally the the idea that someone could be offended by the term mankind or human 0
446980	I find it to be ridiculous if I was talking about the future of mankind and someone correct 0
451780	It being was like what before you finish talking we prefer people kind 0
455410	It would be very hard for me to not tell that person to go fuck themselves 0
457540	It's that level of pushing political correctness that 0
459620	Personally has pushed me more and more from the left to the right that said there is still a good number of people that were 0
464530	Happy that their prime minister said this, but what was very confusing is the update to the story? 0
469360	He's now saying that that moment was a joke I made a dumb joke a few days ago 0
474410	That seems to have gone a little viral in the room on the people claim comment 0
479680	And he also said that it played well in the room but out of context 0
482710	It didn't look so great 0
483730	And if you look at the full video before the the 22 seconds that has been going around like crazy 0
487150	Yeah, this woman kind of going on a rant about power of women God 0
490840	The mother womanly love and near the end she comes back to mankind so I guess that was the joke 0
496540	But at that point the story seemingly 0
498230	changes from Trudeau what he why he did it what he meant by it's not even that it was the 0
503420	Reception so with that side with the newer information does that change your mind on this situation also? 0
507370	What do you think in general well let's talk about updates around the Cape Town water 0
510530	Crisis day 0 still coming up a zero is what the government's calling it when the water storage drops to 0
515690	13.5 percent at that point they're going to turn the taps off to everywhere except hospitals and other vital locations and at that point while 0
521169	The city won't literally run dry ten percent of the water is unusable as far as the rest the plan is to set up two 0
526800	Water distribution sites throughout the city that will serve 20,000 people eat 0
529980	And even then residents will be limited to 25 liters of water per person or we last left off January 0
535240	22nd day zero is supposed to be April 12th and on January 30th. Thanks to a small drop in water usage 0
540269	It was pushed back to April 16 and the news that we're getting today is the projection for day zero has been moved to May 0
544950	11 and this appears to be for multiple reasons 0
546660	But primarily due to the drop in water usage for 0
549010	agricultural purposes in a statement Cape Town deputy mayor Ian Nielson said the drop in 0
553000	agricultural water use of gives Cape Town and some of the other municipalities 0
556000	hope importantly we need to get our consumption down to 0
558760	450 million liters per day to prevent the remaining water supplies running out before the arrival of the anticipated winter rains we cannot accurately 0
565120	Predict the volume of rainfall still to come or when it will come we've also seen the other great news that multiple regions in South 0
570209	Africa have stepped up and donated about a billion liters of water to Cape Town additionally this week 0
574440	We saw a collective of fruit growers in South Africa's over Bourke region begin to release 7 to 10 million cubic meters of water that 0
580200	Could be as much as 2.6. Billion gallons of water from their private dams to help Cape Town 0
584430	That's fantastic because that amount of water is expected to help for 20 days is also seeing individuals step up 0
589050	We saw a woman start an organization called water for pause they take water donations for Cape Town's Animal Shelter 0
593890	population from all over the country 0
595110	I'll include a link down below if you want to donate 0
597060	But still despite all of these bits of good news things still look bad dam levels for Cape Town still are dropping 0
602880	They currently set at just 25 percent 0
604750	capacity and the city is only to have to try and stretch all of that water to be able to last till June when 0
609399	Hopefully the heavier rains come but you never know if it actually will we're talking about South Africa here 0
613529	It's one of the top 50 driest countries in the world we can't necessarily 0
616480	Expect the same kind of recovery as we've seen in the past in situations like this now 0
620040	I say that because a NASA study found that drought recoveries are taking longer and longer and are expect to become more severe and frequent 0
625380	This century so the question becomes not only can Cape Town survive this can they survive what they're going to experience over the next 10 0
630690	years 0

631260	What other cities are we going to potentially see have this same crisis in the near future and what considers do to prevent this we? 0
637410	Need to be asking these questions and getting those answers 0
639690	And then let's talk about the impending 0
641260	Government shutdown in the United States that may not actually come to be without a budget bill signed in the House and Senate by tomorrow 0
646980	Night the government will begin to shut down again 0
648810	We've seen some moves over the past 24 hours that makes it seem very likely that 0
652120	That is not going to happen now the first thing we saw yesterday the House passed a short-term spending bill that would keep the government 0
657149	running for another month now a short-term bill of course not ideal at 0
660279	Kind of kicking the can down the road or you're gonna have the same 0
663139	Potential problem in a month and while that stopgap bill from the house is technically going to the Senate today 0
667540	It is very likely going to die there and the reason for that is Senate leaders have now announced their own 0
672110	Bipartisan deal one. That would actually fund the government for two years 0
675069	I'm pleased to announce that we have reached a two-year budget deal to lift the spending caps for defense and 0
682160	urgent domestic priorities far above current spending levels 0
685910	Is that a plan reportedly increases the limits for defense and non-defense spending by almost three hundred billion? 0
690410	dollars the bill reportedly includes disaster relief funds for Puerto Rico 0
693670	Texas and Florida six billion to fight the opioid crisis 0
697100	131 billion dollar increase for programs important to the middle class 20 billion for infrastructure seven billion for community health 0
704059	centers four billion for Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics five point eight billion for the child care Development 0
708649	Block Grant the deal would also extend chip for ten years old Democrats and Republicans seem to be in favor of the cap increase in 0
714519	The bill and we had Schumer announcing at a vote on this bill would come later this week now could this somehow still fail 0
719389	Yes, well of course we do often see people voting down party lines 0
722329	That's not always the case for example House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced this morning that she won't support any 0
727339	Senate bill unless Paul Ryan commits to vote on an immigration deal and immigration in general in a deal for daca could also be something 0
733149	That holds suspect we had Trump yesterday saying immigration and border security needed to happen 0
736720	Otherwise he welcomed to shut down if we don't change it 0
739180	Let's have a shutdown will do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country 0
743839	I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of 0
748279	So we have to strengthen our borders not by a little bit, but by a lot 0
751779	and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety and 0
756649	Unrelated but still related they don't want to take care of our military 0
760579	Then shut it down 0
762500	We'll go with another shutdown the question becomes what will the president think about this bipartisan deal. He doesn't like it. He says 0
767889	He'll veto it unless it addresses 0
769459	specifically his concerns 0
770949	then you need a different number of votes also the question becomes how many Republicans will agree with Trump here and can it pass the 0
776620	Senate can it pass the House and on the other side will there be more Democrats like Pelosi 0
780160	We just have to wait and see what happened 0
782199	but at the very least we can say is for the first time in a while it seems that even even if it's just 0
786829	Minimal appears that there are actually people in Congress from opposite sides that are willing to make a compromise 0
791800	But once again it could fall apart 0
793240	and I 0
793930	Love to know your thoughts on this and that's where I'm going to end today's show remember if you liked this video you like what? 0
