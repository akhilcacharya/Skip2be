1890	accounting solution for freelancers and 1
3750	small business owners check it out at 1
5460	the link in the video description so 1
8370	we're here at the Sony booth where they 0
9630	are showing off the next evolution in 0
12030	their short throw 4k laser projector 0
15780	technology this one differs from 0
18930	previous iterations in that it is a 0
21210	little bit more furniture like in its 0
23910	implementation so instead of just 0
26699	containing a 4k laser projector it also 0
30300	has a built in shelf and maybe the 0
33480	powers coming back on now nope they were 0
52440	just informing us that there is a power 0
54239	outage we noticed thank you sorry for 0
59309	that so in a nutshell it is a more 0
61680	complete package than ever before and 0
64709	that's why it actually costs more so 0
66960	while the last generation had a couple 0
69150	of cabinets and speakers this one has a 0
71939	shelf which is cool because you can put 0
74970	your xbox excuse me your your 0
77790	PlayStation down there and it also has 0
80070	three excuse me five speakers and a 0
83460	subwoofer so there's two tweeters using 0
85920	Sony's advanced vertical drive so 0
88140	they're actually glass and they radiate 0
90689	sound in all directions and there are 0
93150	three mid-range speakers built into the 0
95310	chassis with one of them actually firing 0
97860	out the back that acts as a centre 0
100890	speaker so it's it's pointed at the wall 0
102840	and then it bounces the sound towards 0
105149	the viewer the sub is actually the big 0
108180	thing that's kind of at the back near 0
110340	the bottom and from listening to it it's 0
113040	actually surprising how much sound 0
114960	they've managed to pack into this little 0
117240	package now let's talk about the image 0
119880	so it actually uses pretty similar tech 0
122340	to Sony's last generation solution so 0
124649	it's still a single laser DLP but that's 0
127079	without a spinning colour wheel so you 0
128848	shouldn't see any rainbow effect and it 0
130919	can handle a maximum image size of a 0
132750	hundred and 0
133540	20 inches at only nine and a half inches 0
136329	from the wall so that's actually pretty 0
138069	similar to what we're looking at right 0
140170	here it's 4k it's HDR it has a maximum 0
144250	luminance of 2500 lumens and they're 0
146620	planning to make it available in the US 0
148390	sometime this spring now it's gonna cost 0
151989	you a pretty penny at about $30,000 but 0
155859	if you think of it more in terms of like 0
157890	fancy furniture pricing and less in 0
161409	terms of firing a laser projected image 0
164920	at your wall pricing then maybe that 0
167889	starts to get a little bit more 0
169269	reasonable if you're into that sort of 0
170620	thing I mean you got your engineered 0
172359	marble top you got your design that I 0
174579	think subjectively looks pretty darn 0
176889	good and neutral so it should look great 0
