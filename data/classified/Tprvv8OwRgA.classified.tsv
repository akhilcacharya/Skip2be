39740	now we're getting this news. 0
40607	And I had a lot of 0

41942	"What do you feel about this?" 0
43176	And my response to that is 0
44111	I'm almost never happy 0

46079	There are exceptions like when 0
47314	we found out 0

48916	I was very happy 0

50417	I think I was high 0

52085	And here when 0

53453	I don't have that same feeling. 0
54354	I'm not happy 0

55989	For some reason there's this 0

58425	you know, you forgive 0

59860	They're still a human being 0
61035	but no we're talking about 0

62596	And this is the part in a story 0

65165	vocal minority that says, 0

67334	"between pedophiles and 0

70237	But I understand if a pedophile 0

72406	consuming child pornography, 0

87587	is one less pedophile 0

89266	if it kept trending 0

91692	I do thank him for saving the 0

94094	and really the only 0

95762	in this instance is his family. 0
97154	Suicide is a very real issue but 0

100033	does not absolve them of what 0

103136	I saw Salling's attorney 0

105072	"Mark was a 0

106440	"a person of great creativity, 0

118012	also they really 0

119586	To me, that's personally, 0

121154	You're a big fan of someone's 0

123457	feel about them being 0

125926	Nah, it sounds like 0

127294	The second reason it bugs me is 0

129429	"mistake" and "errors of 0

132499	downloaded, 0

135335	600 videos of underage 0

137938	But that said, I want to 0

141141	Do you agree with how 0

142709	Do you disagree with 0

144444	I'd love to know your thoughts. 0
145545	And then we had 0

147381	Remember how people in 0

149416	38 minutes because 0

151318	"Ballistic missile incoming... 0

153687	And Hawaiian authorities 0

156156	someone hitting 0

157691	Their explanation that 0

162529	According to a new report, 0

164464	According to the initial 0

166466	federal officials, 0

168590	this organization decided 0

170370	have an unannounced drill. 0
171405	You know, "We have 0

172379	"Make sure that they are on 0

174574	Well apparently when the 0

177344	it did include the audio 0

180814	but apparently the audio 0

183683	"exercise, exercise, exercise" 0

187054	"This is not a drill." 0
188121	And so now that we've learned 0

190090	actually sent out the alert to 0

192939	he didn't hear the 0

194895	did hear the 0

196596	So this alert went out because 0

198799	missile was 0

200667	Which looking back at the 0

202803	because, reportedly, after 0

205872	this is a drill, there's also 0

208408	where you have to say, yes, 0

210811	no, whoops, sorry 0

212446	And actually a last 0

214147	that emergency 0

216116	According to a 0

217484	"The employee 'has been 0

218837	"'for the same staff 0

220821	So still incredibly ridiculous, 0

223757	situation but now it appears 0

226513	Then in what are some people 0

228662	let's talk about Kim Kardashian. 0
230497	Kim for whatever 0

231832	probably that she got tired that 0

233934	less than a thousand retweets, 0
235435	decided to go on a 0

246179	you are not your 0

247981	That you can't be sexual or 0

250717	That's stupid in my opinion but 0

253019	wasn't actually because of that. 0
254354	It was because of her braids and 0
255419	something she said 0

257023	- So guys I did 0

262557	and I'm really into it. 0

307007	style in 1979 so 0

309576	She just shows this reference, 0

311144	And my whole response to this 0

313513	You're gonna make me 0

315549	As far as people closing 0

317217	"That style's not for you. 0

319186	no, I disagree completely. 0
320487	As far as the attribution angle, 0
321615	I can understand some 0

323256	I'm not personally frustrated. 0

325659	I don't think Kim Kardashian 0

327761	Granted, if you really look 0

329462	it goes back 0

331198	and thousands of years. 0
332165	It's also a part of 0

333800	I understand if you feel 0

336369	that in some way, I understand. 0
337938	But feelings aren't facts and so 0

340574	like it's just being 0

342442	who are professionally offended. 0
343647	But, of course, that said this 0

345512	I give you the story, 0

347113	and then I want 0

347978	You, as a group, have so 0

350050	so many different opinions and 0
351418	I'd love to know 0

352552	From that I want to share 0

354734	in Today in Awesome. 0
356022	And the first bit of awesome is 0
357023	we got a trailer for 0

358992	Then we got a trailer for 0

361394	It's going to be 0

362729	Dunca Jones, of course, 0

364664	"Source Code", or we don't 0

367300	It looks like a 0

368935	That said, we also got a trailer 0

371404	trippier and that is the 0

373106	"Hereditary". 0
373874	I'm excited for this one not 0

375642	good but because people that 0
376643	watched it at Sundance 0

378245	Then keeping with the 0

380313	we have a horror short. 0

382449	It's just six minutes, 0

384784	you have six minutes to spare. 0
386019	If you want to see the full 0

387420	I just shared, 0

388888	anything at all, links is always 0

391658	And then let's talk about 0
392325	President Trump and 0

394094	Today you may have seen one 0

396129	saying "Trump refuses to impose 0

399199	"passed by US Congress 0

401301	And this has sparked questions 0

403403	administration's perceived 0

405338	a strong stance on Russia. 0
406473	Let's explain why this is 0

408575	the White House 0

410110	And to do that, let's first 0

412312	Congress almost 0

414414	Countering America's Adversaries 0

416683	We're talking a 0

419119	That's an insane 0

420420	They can go outside say, 0

422822	they'd have like a 10 hour 0

425158	The vote would end up 0

426960	So it goes through 0

428295	the President doesn't like it 0

430597	With how much 0

431965	even if Trump had vetoed it, 0

434100	So what did the law do? 0

436102	Iran and North Korea for 0

438745	and, critical to the current 0

441041	also imposed rules for 0

443043	And this was meant to 0

445045	Their annexation of Crimea, 0

447213	separatists in eastern Ukraine. 0
448648	The Russian meddling 0

450550	And this bill was supposed to 0

452585	defensive and 0

453920	Also the bill removed 0

455355	to change sanctions as freely. 0
456923	This by imposing 0

458792	And this meant the President 0

460927	sanctions which was something 0
462062	Congress feared 0

463596	And despite signing 0

465332	"In its haste to 0

466933	"the Congress included a number 0
468101	"of clearly 0

470103	Later adding, "This bill 0

472405	"particularly because 0

474107	"executive branch's 0

475909	"Congress could not even 0

477811	"after seven years of talking. 0
479045	"By limiting the 0

480714	"this bill makes it harder for 0

483016	"deals for the American 0

485085	"Russia and North Korea 0

486953	Now today is not actually the 0

489089	deadline on this law. 0
490190	The first one 0

491658	The Trump administration was 0

493960	Issuing "regulations or other 0

497230	"that are a part of, 0

500400	"the defense and 0

502035	"government of 0

503436	And it took roughly three weeks 0

505672	the administration to 0

507674	So then comes the big deadline, 0

511444	The administration is 0

513113	a few things by this point. 0
514214	They were supposed 0

516216	These are individuals with 0

518618	who've made large sums of money 0
519986	because of their 0

521354	Here the administration barely 0
522489	put out the list right 0

524057	They listed 114 0

526026	96 billionaires and 0

528328	Also note here, they issue 0

530324	but we don't know 0

532031	Next up were the 0

533366	viewed as the big sanctions. 0
534701	CAATSA required that the US 0

537003	and entities that are doing 0

539606	"on the October 1st blacklist." 0
540874	And these sanctions were meant 0

542976	Russian arms and 0

544711	the Russian arms industry. 0
545678	However, the Trump 0

547981	and this is where 0

549416	Many are upset by this move. 0
550884	Representative Eliot Engel 0

552986	Committee saying, "I'm fed up 0

555221	"to protect our country 0

556990	"They've now shown 0

558358	"so it's time for 0

559826	"The Trump administration had a 0

561761	"would follow the law and crack 0

564064	"attacking American 0

566065	"They chose instead to let 0

568201	Claire McCaskill tweeting, 0

571171	"to impose sanctions on Russia. 0
572505	"The President 0

574140	"Folks that is a 0

576309	"There should be outrage in 0

578611	And a note there, 0

580079	to Article 2, Section 3 and 0

583183	which is a thing I totally know 0

585852	out thanks to the 0

587220	the President 0

588888	"be faithfully executed". 0
590023	But on that note, 0

591357	Trump administration say they 0

593526	the sanctions 0

594694	They're still being widely 0

596796	know what their rationale is. 0
597697	We had State Department official 0

600166	saying, "Sanctions on specific 0

602969	"need to be imposed 0

604904	"in fact, serving 0

606306	"Since the enactment of 0

608041	"we estimate that foreign 0

609843	"planned or announced purchases 0

612612	"Russian defense acquisitions." 0
613847	And so essentially the 0

615548	sanctions in place because 0

617665	has caused deals 0

619252	However a point of contention 0

622088	evidence to back up the claim. 0
623423	And then another argument from 0
624457	the White House 0

626326	CAATSA only says that 0

628548	"significant transaction" with 0

631498	However, they say the 0

633270	"significant transactions" are. 0
635168	The law also allows 0

636936	sanctions if they see an entity 0

640473	"their deals with Russia". 0
641407	They just need to notify 0

643676	However, "significantly" is 0

646513	So based on that technicality, 0

648748	still doing 0

650083	You could say, "Well, is 0

652552	And then go like, "Well, it's 0

655154	And then you could go, "That 0

657757	"Bajillion's kind 0

659592	"for significant in my book." 0
660693	Also, because I know sometimes 0

663012	these videos because 0

664964	yes, I know bajillion's 0

666533	That's kind of the point, okay. 0
667667	Also another important note here 0

669903	published of potential sanction 0

672539	those on the blacklist. 0
673506	The problem for the 0

674908	major US and NATO 0

677010	Turkey, for example, 0

679112	They also have a major deal with 0
680513	Russia for anti-aircraft 0

682348	Saudi Arabia as well 0

684517	and is a huge US 0

686286	India is also a huge partner 0

688454	and a massive buyer 0

690190	And so the argument 0

691766	those countries, all of 0

693634	Trump administration 0

695428	It'd put the United States 0

697263	And while the administration 0

699065	impose sanctions, they're 0

701634	so is a deterrent enough. 0
702835	But that said, all of this 0

704771	CIA Director Mike Pompeo stated 0

708408	that Russia will try to 0

710710	And so many people are seeing 0

712679	taking the teeth 0

714380	You have Russia, who according 0

716649	"Yes, they're going to try 0

718851	You had sanctions that were 0

721020	were meant to punish Russia not 0

724257	for many other things and you 0

726526	still reportedly selling 0

729629	allies but because "specifically" 0
731076	isn't defined in 0

732812	you're not dealing with exacts, 0

735068	"Ah, it's not a lot. 0

736536	That still seems pretty damn 0

739606	is very weird for the 0

742058	mindset I think is supposed to 0

744611	It's nationalism 0

746646	But all of that said, I do want 0

749148	What are your thoughts here? 0
750116	Do you think this 0

751451	It shows us something? 0
752352	Or you think no, you 0

754854	You understand the argument of 0

756823	I'd love to know what 0

758157	And that's where 0

759525	And remember, 0

760860	you like what I'm 0
