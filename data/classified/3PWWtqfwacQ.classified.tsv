8520	 The Cumberland Valley houses six villages that are between Hagerstown in Maryland and Harrisburg 0
13380	 Pennsylvania - Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle and Mecanicsburg. 0
17480	 What is so special about these small villages in Pennsylvania is that they are almost exactly 0
24910	 16 kilometers apart. 0
26319	 The distances do not deviate more than one mile from this line. 0
30649	 This is no coincidence and this is also not planned. 0
33540	 If you draw equally large circles around the villages, you can see their influence circles. 0
38980	 Assuming that every city has exactly the same stores and services, rational people will go 0
43330	 to the village nearest to buy or sell their goods. 0
47220	 When villages are sixteen kilometers apart, this means that no one has to travel more than 8 kilometers to get one 0
52030	 reach the village. 0
53030	 All these villages were founded before the United States was formed, what 0
56620	 means that nobody had cars and everybody had to walk everywhere. 0
61510	 16 kilometers, or 5 kilometers there and back, is about the distance that one can travel well 0
67280	 in one day with enough time to buy or sell goods on a central market. 0
71600	 In this period before the car, a radius of 8 kilometers was in fact the greatest possible 0
76630	 work traffic zone for small farming villages and therefore a distance of 16 kilometers was the most 0
82340	 efficient way to use rural terrain. 0
85270	 Take a look at the map of a rural environment that existed before the car. 0
90030	 You will see that the distance between medium-sized villages is almost always somewhere between 0
95250	 16 and 24 kilometers. 0
97620	 Because the Cumberland valley is a valley, villages could only develop in a line, 0
102280	 but in most cases villages develop in all directions. 0
105690	 This is what the 16-kilometer rule looks like when it goes in all directions. 0
109360	 Each of these points is a village and the hexagon around it is the area from which people 0
113760	 will come to the village. 0
115180	 In the real world, each of these villages will have a small supermarket, just like a pharmacy, a bank 0
120310	 and maybe a restaurant. 0
121680	 Since everyone uses these services, not many people have to live in the circle of influence 0
126240	 of these villages to continue to exist. 0
129780	 But where do you place something that is more specialized, such as a car mechanic. 0
133370	 People only have to go to an auto mechanic once in a while, so you need more people for it 0
137180	 survival of a garage than for a supermarket. 0
140420	 Some of these villages develop into larger villages with more people who take care of it 0
145120	 the survival of more specialized shops and services. 0
148000	 Bringing these larger villages closer together with specialized stores would be untenable, 0
152590	 since not enough people would go to these stores. But place them further apart 0
156420	 would again be inefficient because there is land from which people would not go to a city. 0
160670	 This happens once or twice, until you have cities. 0
163970	 These cities have the largest influence circles and the most specialized stores. 0
168540	 Of course there are still supermarkets and pharmacies in cities, but there are also things 0
172730	 as dealers of expensive cars, special hospitals and airports. 0
176500	 The influence circle of a city is enormous, because people will travel hundreds of kilometers 0
182290	 to buy an expensive car, to get a special treatment or to fly from an airport. 0
186920	 Think about it in a city. 0
188420	 How far would you walk to buy a latte? 0
191550	 Probably only a few blocks and that is why you see a Starbucks or other coffee shop 0
195879	 on almost every street corner. 0
197580	 Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people for one 0
202250	 to maintain a coffee shop. 0
203250	 But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook? 0
206170	 Probably quite far, since it is an incidental and sustainable purchase. 0
209989	 That is why Apple Stores are rare, even in cities. 0
213820	 You need a large amount of people to maintain an Apple Store and we can even roughly 0
218980	 calculate how much that is there. 0
220650	 In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 30 kilometers away from the Store in New Haven 0
225230	 to the northeast and from the Store in Stamford to the southwest. 0
228220	 In the radius of 16 kilometers around the Trumbull Apple Store there are about half a million 0
231970	 residents, which tells us that you need about half a million people to have one Apple Store 0
237700	 to maintain. 0
238700	 We can compare that with the Starbucks stores in Manhattan, which are spread over one 0
242390	 average distance of about 180 meters. 0
245150	 A circle of 90 meters around a Starbucks in Manhatten contains about 6,000 people, 0
251560	 which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to continue to exist. 0
255730	 Of course both Connecticut and New York are places with an above-average income 0
259978	 means fewer people are needed to maintain one Starbucks or Apple Store. 0
263900	 The figures would be different in for example rural Kansas, but because every store generally 0
268470	 allleen builds in areas with above-average income, this gives us a pretty good picture of how much 0
273010	 people need Apple and Starbucks to open a store. 0
277630	 Our model thus shows where cities should be, but that is not the way it looks. 0
283199	 This is the most efficient distribution of cities, if you assume that the cities are on one 0
287051	 perfectly smooth landscape are built, without geographical aspects, no social influences, more variety 0
293270	 in income, even distribution of resources - in other words, assuming that the world is a homogenous place ... 0
299760	 and it is not. 0
300760	 In reality, our world has a huge impact on where and why cities develop. 0
306750	 To begin with, let's take this model back to one city in a bare environment without resources. 0
311479	 What most influences the location of cities is water. 0
315400	 If we place an ocean next to our isotropic stretch of land, our city will almost certainly develop 0
320410	 close to this ocean. 0
321590	 Oceans still connect the world. 0
325010	 There is no other way of transport to transport such large quantities of goods 0
329630	 for so little money. 0
330919	 Every city must be economically efficient to grow and it costs more for goods 0
335830	 to a city that is 1,500 kilometers inland than to a city near the ocean. 0
340610	 Just look at Europe. 0
341610	 Six of the ten largest European cities are within 150 kilometers of the coast. 0
346280	 But oceans are not the only forms of water that affect cities. 0
349650	 Rivers have just as much - or perhaps even more - influence. 0
352940	 Milan, the 18 th largest city in Europe, is the largest one that is not immediately on 0
358531	 an ocean or river lies and then it is only 25 kilometers away from a river and 120 kilometers from 0
364270	 the ocean. 0
365280	 Until the last century, cities could not survive without direct access to water. 0
370330	 If you need more evidence: 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen 0
375540	 kilometers from the ocean. 0
377370	 Perhaps the most logical attraction for cities is resources, so back to us isotropically 0
382120	 land: we place raw materials somewhere on this map and sign cities in the neighborhood. 0
387020	 Cities that existed for the past century arose close to resources, 0
392110	 like Pittsburgh, since this city acted as producer and transporter for 0
396370	 these means, but nowadays cities that depend on resources are no longer so close to 0
401800	 the means itself to be established. 0
403720	 New techniques of transport can supply the resources from their source. 0
408020	 Just look at Dubai. 0
409300	 Of course, the UAE have a huge supply of oil, but they are much closer to Abu Dhabi and 0
413990	 the southwest than Dubai. 0
416630	 In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 inhabitants, less than half of Carlisle in Pennsylvania - one 0
422590	 from the farming villages we talked about at the beginning of this video. 0
425300	 That only grew to 40,000 in 1960, but nowadays it is known worldwide and has more than it 0
432880	 2.5 million inhabitants. 0
433880	 It was able to grow rapidly - even faster than Abu Dhabi - because it threw itself 0
439180	 as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industry in the region. 0
444380	 Another geographic aspect that we can add to the piece of land are mountains. 0
447860	 Mountains do not always have the same effect on cities. 0
452210	 Mexico City, Bogota and Addis Ababa are all three huge cities that are higher than 0
459180	 2,000 meters. 0
460180	 Mountains make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection. 0
464870	 Many cities from antiquity developed in these places because they were easy to protect ... 0
469400	 and that provided more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also stand in the way of that development. 0
474669	 For a time the United States could not develop anything west of the Appalachian mountains. 0
479259	 These mountains were a huge obstacle. 0
481710	 In 1800, the center of the population was here, despite 0
488110	 that the US had sovereignty over this entire area. 0
491740	 Ultimately, technology defeated this obstacle and could extend the population 0
495860	 to what is now Missouri, but if the Appalachians had not existed, 0
500590	 American history and geography had looked very different. 0
504770	 We had seen urban developments much earlier in the mid-west. 0
507580	 But mountains can also have a different effect. 0
510600	 Coal, silver, gold and other minerals are often located in mountainous regions 0
516078	 areas and, just like in Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable areas 0
521188	 because of the resources. 0
522698	 The economic benefit of exploiting the funds is stronger than the economic disadvantage 0
528040	 an inhospitable area. 0
530239	 Denver, Colorado grew by 650% between 1870 and 1880 thanks to the opening of a rail network 0
537360	 connected to the transcontinental rail network. 0
539959	 It served as an access point for transportation to gold mines in the Rocky Mountains. 0
544819	 Mountains can therefore keep cities away, but also attract themselves - it really depends 0
549370	 of the circumstances. 0
550869	 Let's exchange our isotropic piece of land for a world map. 0
554110	 What should the cities be on here? 0
555730	 The cities of our world are not necessarily all located in the most geographically efficient location. 0
562089	 Although there is a certain level of natural selection that allows the efficiently placed cities to grow 0
566410	 and the inefficiently placed cities shrink, people are not always able to 0
570800	 to build cities in the most efficient place. 0
573170	 Let's get the 224 cities in the world that have a population of more than 2 million. 0
578569	 You can immediately see some patterns. 0
580860	 We put the equator on the map and you see a clear difference. 0
584160	 Only 32 of these cities are in the southern hemisphere. 0
587949	 One might think that this is because there is much more land in the northern hemisphere, 0
592589	 but that is not entirely true. 0
594439	 The southern hemisphere still has 32% of all the country in the world, but only 14% 0
600689	 of the largest cities in the world. 0
602360	 There is clearly a greater density of cities in the northern hemisphere. 0
606589	 You can easily trace this back to Europe and Asia. 0
609749	 The first great civilizations and dominions were on these two continents, although it 0
614410	 human race probably originated in Africa. 0
617649	 There are hundreds of different theories about why civilizations are successful in some places 0
621779	 and do not succeed in other locations, but one of the more plausible and interesting explanations is that 0
625929	 Europe and Asia were successful because they are broad, rather than high. 0
629850	 The shape of the continents may have changed human history. 0
633959	 When a continent is wide, you have a lot of land with roughly the same climate. 0
639959	 A climate generally changes when you go north or south, not when you go east or west, 0
644040	 because of the way the earth revolves around the sun. 0
646610	 Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with growing plants, 0
650989	 the breeding of animals and the associated technology. 0
653629	 When you expand in width, the climate is sufficiently equal so that a rule is the same 0
657739	 successful plants and animals can use, while expanding in height requires that new ones 0
662829	 plants and animals are bred and bred. 0
664920	 If a civilization started in central America, for example, there would be very little land 0
669709	 on the continent with a similar climate and the expansion possibilities would be limited. 0
674839	 In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there are thousands and thousands of kilometers with the same 0
680220	 climate that can be achieved simply by traveling east or west. 0
683429	 There is evidence to support this. 0
684429	 Just look at the maps of the four greatest early empires - the Qing dynasty, the Abbasid- 0
689389	 Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate and the Mongolian Empire. 0
692940	 These were all in Eurasia and the horizontal spread. 0
696980	 When some of the more modern empires expanded, there was already technology to do this sea. 0
702119	 The three great modern empires were the British, Spanish and French empires - all of them 0
707420	 coming from a similar climate. 0
709610	 An important reason why America was able to be successful was because all agriculture came from Europe 0
715220	 worked there too. 0
716759	 In terms of climate technology, Europe and America are almost identical. 0
720370	 The majority of developed colonized countries are in the Northern Hemisphere because 0
724619	 these were closest to Europe, but former British countries like South Africa, Australia 0
729649	 and New Zealand are all very developed and are located in the southern hemisphere. 0
733410	 Their success at the expense of the more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also become partial 0
737859	 attributed to their climate, which more closely matches that in Europe. 0
740989	 Let's ask one more question. 0
743529	 If our world had only one city, where would it be? 0
748059	 If you take the average of the location of every person in the world, you will end up 0
752959	 in the south of central Asia. 0
754730	 That means that this entire region is the best place to live, but true 0
760449	 exactly must our metropolis come? 0
763899	 This region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia, so we already meet 0
768910	 those two criteria. 0
771129	 We want a spot within about 150 kilometers of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains 0
776769	 rich in minerals - the only real best place for a city on earth is probably ... 0
782600	 Dhaka, Bangladesh. 0
784480	 Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to build a city 0
790149	 than here. 0
791249	 There is evidence to support this: Dhaka is between the third largest metropolis 0
796259	 on earth, depending on how you define it and Bangladesh is except for 5 0
801869	 the most densely populated country in the world - 161 million people live in an area that is about the size of 0
809660	 England. 0
810660	 History has sufficiently influenced geography making it the largest and most advanced civilizations 0
814809	 not all in the south of central Asia, but if we would start all over again, humanity 0
819990	 would do again, then each geographic model says that this region the origin and the central 0
826410	 point of human civilization. 0
