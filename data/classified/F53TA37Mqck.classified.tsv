560	 So there is a fantastic list on Wikipedia called 'Wikipedia: Unusual Items'. 0
6000	 I just remember it as that Wikipedia list. 0
9000	 It is a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected and incredible subjects. 0
14000	 Whichever link you click, it is guaranteed to be interesting. 0
17000	 And that is why I am going to click on a new link 0
20500	 and you learn a bit more about our amazing world. 0
24000	 Today we are going to make a trip. 0
26000	 We are going to escape the stiff boundaries of the earth. 0
28800	 Up to the heavens. 0
30000	 We travel through the galaxy. 0
32000	 To learn about keeping time, on the red planet. 0
34500	 Mars. 0
36000	 But before we can keep track of the time on Mars, 0
38000	 we must first understand how we keep time on the earth. 0
40500	 Damn. Ehm. Can we ... can we turn this thing around? 0
47900	 OK. So this is the Greenwich Observatory, in England. 0
51000	 Greenwich is known as the place where the prime meridian lies. 0
54000	 For clarity, this is the middle of the earth in length. 0
58000	 For the sake of clarity we say that time is determined on the basis of the sun. 0
62500	 However, this is not entirely true, so I have another video in which time is explained in more detail. 0
67000	 When the sun is at its highest in the air at a random location, we call it 12:00 in the afternoon. 0
71500	 And the time during the rest of the day is relative to this. 0
74200	 So let's go south now, to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian. 0
78500	 We are in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea. 0
81000	 Just as the prime meridian is the middle of the earth in length, 0
85000	 the equator is the center of the earth in width. 0
88000	 At this point of 0 째 length and 0 째 width, 0
91100	 It is 12:00, because the sun is at its highest point in the air. 0
94500	 Beautiful. When we go 1000 째 to the east, 0
98600	 we are in the nice village of Etoumbi, in the Republic of Congo. 0
102600	 In Etoumbi it is 13:00 in the afternoon, 0
105600	 because the sun was here at its highest point an hour ago. 0
108000	 This is why we have time zones. 0
110000	 Since the earth revolves every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones. 0
114000	 But wait a minute, I lied. The earth does not do 24 hours to do a round, 0
122300	 That is because there are actually two definitions of 'one day'. 0
125500	 The usual definition is a solar day. 0
128000	 That is the time between 12:00 noon, when the sun is at its highest in the air. 0
131300	 The more scientific definition is a star day. 0
135000	 That is the time it takes the earth to turn 360 째 around its axis 0
139000	 and therefore also the time it takes for a star to appear in the same place 0
142000	 between one and the other day. 0
144000	 There is a difference between star days and sunny days 0
147000	 because the earth revolves around its own axis and around the sun. 0
150700	 So, look at this. 0
152000	 Let's put a point on a spot on the earth and flush a star day. 0
156500	 You will see that the same point is not the closest yet 0
159500	 is in the sun because the earth also revolves around the sun. 0
163000	 To bring the point as close as possible to the sun, 0
165400	 we have to go 4 minutes ahead and now one solar day has passed. 0
169000	 Those 4 minutes count perfectly up to about 24 hours, spread over a year. 0
174000	 This means that a star day is more than solar days per year. 0
178000	 Okay, now we can go to Mars. 0
180000	 That was quick. 0
182000	 Mars is a planet that looks quite like the earth and time works in a similar way. 0
186300	 It has a prime meridian ... here. 0
189000	 Strangely enough, astronomers chose this prime meridian before it was chosen from the earth. 0
193500	 According to the same principle as the Greenwich Mean Time, 0
196800	 there is a coordinated Mars time called MTC. 0
199800	 But in general, robot cars use Mars 0
202500	 just the time of the place where they land. 0
206000	 This is almost the same as how places on earth 0
209000	 determined their time before coordinated time zones existed. 0
212000	 Each place on earth determined the time with the highest position of the sun as 12:00 in the afternoon. 0
216000	 However, this became difficult when ways were found to travel quickly between places, 0
220000	 since nobody knew more then what time it was. 0
221600	 If you want to know more about this, you can view my other video over time. 0
227000	 Since there have only been 11 operational spacecraft on Mars, 0
231000	 the use of times based on the sun has never caused problems. 0
235500	 That means, however, that even the seconds are not coordinated between the different robot cars. 0
240500	 What is a little tricky is that a day on Mars takes a little longer than a day on earth. 0
245600	 Everyone who has watched The Martian, knows that a solar day on Mars is called a Sol. 0
257000	 Robot trucks on Mars generally work only during the day, 0
259500	 partly because some work on solar energy 0
261500	 and partly because a lot of work is carried through cameras and enough light is needed. 0
266000	 That is why the teams that run the robot cars on Mars from the earth live 0
269500	 based on time on Mars. 0
271500	 Their shifts shift every day for 40 minutes to coordinate it 0
275500	 with the time that it is light on Mars. 0
277500	 Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 0
281000	 who has worked on the Spirit and Opportunity programs, says that 0
291000	 scientists who work with robot trucks sometimes have two watches, 0
294500	 one for the time on Mars and one for the time on earth. 0
297000	 So when we go to Mars we have to create time zones and use the coordinated time. 0
303000	 Having different time standards in different places always causes problems, 0
307500	 especially for computers and communication. 0
310000	 This is of course only one of the many details that we need to figure out before we start living on the red planet. 0
319000	 I hope you enjoyed the episode of this week, it was a lot more instructive than last week's 0
323500	 the direction of toilet paper, which you can find here. 0
326500	 You can also subscribe to this channel by clicking here. 0
329500	 Oh and before you leave, this is my official question if you want to follow me on Twitter. 0
335000	 I have 13 followers and although I think that 13 are very nice, I would like to have more people to talk to. 0
341000	 My username is @WendoverPro. 0
344000	 Thanks for watching and come back next week for more than The Wikipedia list. 0
