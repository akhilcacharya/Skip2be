30	synergy 2 is available now and makes 1
2429	sharing a keyboard a mouse between two 1
4350	systems so simple that anyone could do 1
6629	it check it out in the link of the 1
7770	description down below 1
8910	we're here at fantex checking out a 0
10950	setup that has two power supplies shared 0
13349	into one system that's so simple anyone 0
15179	can do it or one power supply shared 0
17730	into two systems so simple that anyone 0
19740	could do it 0
20520	fantex has teamed up with c sonic to 0
22890	make these power supplies and they're 0
24359	two different ones for the two different 0
26220	applications let's start with the revolt 0
27930	Pro this is the one you'll be using if 0
29670	you want to use multiple power supplies 0
31320	on the same system that isn't just two 0
34260	you could theoretically go beyond just 0
36480	the two we have here but I suspect the 0
38520	vast majority of people will stick with 0
40230	just two power supplies now how does 0
41489	this work you may have seen the power 0
43500	supply combiner and splitter that fantex 0
45989	is released in the past they've 0
47460	essentially built that functionality 0
48840	into these power supplies individually 0
51539	so the revolt Pro has your motherboard 0
53280	connector a whole bunch of CPU and PCIe 0
55440	connectors a whole bunch of SATA and 0
57180	molex connectors and then down below 0
58829	these rubber stoppers there's another 0
61050	motherboard and another CPU pin input 0
64110	connector that you would plug another 0
65820	power supply into it doesn't technically 0
67500	have to be a fan Tech's power supply 0
69210	although I do suspect that they would 0
71010	probably prefer that but you could use 0
72780	whatever power supply you want and it's 0
74790	able to share some of its power up to I 0
76950	believe 600 watts through this main 0
78930	power supply but it's also able you're 0
81090	able to use the other cables from the 0
82740	other power supply if you want to plug 0
83939	in more molexes or more graphics cards 0
86130	or whatever else you need 0
87119	and there's failover protection so if 0
89700	you are able to power both systems off 0
91979	of one power supply that is connected 0
93689	into each other say you go with the 0
95460	1,000 watt version and you have a beefy 0
97829	system or the 850 watt version and you 0
100229	have a fairly mid-tier average system 0
102750	that people are building these days one 0
104369	entire power supply could go down and 0
106170	your system won't shut down another cool 0
108299	thing about this that I like is if 0
110100	you're building a system that you need 0
111750	to power supplies for say Austin and 0
113970	scrapyard Wars season 3 or if you're 0
116250	mining or if you're just doing something 0
118890	crazy with computers and you need 0
120600	multiple power supplies you don't have 0
122280	to mess around with bridging the 24 pin 0
124740	connector with the green wire and the 0
126329	black wire and making sure that you 0
127710	switch both the power supplies on at the 0
129628	exact right time so that you don't have 0
131250	part of your system powered up and the 0
133050	other part 0
133440	not powered up now everything's plugged 0
135300	into each other it's really simple you 0
136980	have one power switch everything's just 0
138630	fine it'll work but moving on from there 0
140910	we have the revolt X which is kind of 0
143190	the opposite it splits instead of 0
145590	joining on this one you have labels for 0
148350	system one where you have motherboard 0
150150	CPU connections SATA molex PCIe all that 0
153930	kind of stuff and then there's system 0
155670	two where you have motherboard and CPU 0
156990	as well this is also great but for 0
159870	completely different scenarios this 0
161670	enables you to run say two systems in 0
164070	one box you could have your main system 0
165960	that you do everything on air and your 0
167370	day-to-day then you could have your 0
168720	streaming box or a workstation or a test 0
171000	system or whatever else on the other 0
172680	side this also makes it so that say you 0
174450	have two workstations next to each other 0
176100	you could run them out of the same box 0
177870	with two systems out of the same box 0
179670	split monitors onto each side and then 0
182010	you're at higher efficiency this is a 0
183870	1200 watt Platinum rated power supply 0
187020	and if you look at efficiency curves 0
188970	down on the lower end if you're not 0
190710	using that much power say both the 0
192360	systems are idling on two separate power 0
194730	supplies you're at low efficiency on 0
197070	both of the power supplies this will 0
198959	make it that you're gonna climb the 0
200100	efficiency curve a little bit make us of 0
201780	those idling times which is actually a 0
203400	pretty high percentage of the time 0
204690	you're using your core you're not using 0
206130	your computer I guess when you're asleep 0
207690	and whatnot if you don't turn your 0
208890	computer off or even when you just walk 0
210630	away from it if it's idling it will be 0
212430	more efficient than other possible 0
214500	solutions you get one power supply that 0
216540	isn't at a higher price than it would be 0
218489	if it didn't have this internal 0
219720	functionality it's a quite competitive 0
221130	price for other power supplies at the 0
222480	1200 watt range same with the revolt pro 0
225060	that we mentioned earlier it's not 0
226320	necessarily higher price than anything 0
227880	else in its competitive range and it 0
229380	looks really good 0
230160	I like this grill on the top and you're 0
232260	able to gain this functionality you 0
233730	could use these things you could use the 0
235530	revolt X 1200 watt as a single power 0
237870	supply for a single system you could use 0
239940	the revolt Pro 850 or 1000 watt as a 0
242850	single power supply for a single system 0
245040	you're paying essentially the same 0
246510	amount and you're gaining functionality 0
248220	to possibly use in the future say you 0
249660	want to grow on your system you want to 0
251760	add a graphics card or two or do some 0
254160	other crazy stuff and you have the 0
256320	revolt Pro well you could just get 0
257970	another power supply link it in you have 0
260070	more wattage you have more connectors 0
261630	everything's kind of handled for you 0
262950	it's nice and smooth so you go with the 0
264960	revolt X and you 0
266360	- just add another whole computer you 0
268639	had a workstation beside you you had an 0
270080	employee your girlfriend wants a 0
271639	computer something like that you already 0
273650	have the power supply you just plug it 0
275689	into the other system and you're done 0
277099	you even have to buy another one that's 0
278659	pretty cool a trusted power supply brand 0
281030	like see sonic coming together with 0
282349	fantex to add really cool functionality 0
284180	to their power supplies and make 0
285770	everything nice and simple and easy to 0
287479	use is really cool if you decide to go 0
289250	with something like the revolt X and 0
290539	have two systems you might need some 1
292909	software to link the keyboard and mouse 1
294919	as well over the system soon I'm doing 1
297080	sponsor spot there we go synergy 2 is 1
299479	out they've simplified a whole bunch of 1
300979	stuff with the new release there's no 1
302629	longer the server client settings that 1
304550	you have to set up just all your systems 1
306020	will work together it's also able to 1
308000	communicate over more complicated 1
309979	networks that's energy to you sooner if 1
311870	you one used to have problems with back 1
313250	in the past so you have to worry about 1
314840	that stuff anymore 1
315650	there's a new UI there's SSL encrypted 1
318319	connections it's it's much more simple 1
320930	even able to access your computers 1
322639	before you've logged into them if you 1
324500	have all this stuff shared over which is 1
326569	nice so you can move the stuff over 1
328009	login from there everything's nice and 1
330050	good to go if you want to check it out 1
331849	check it out in the link in the 1
332719	description I like the video if you 0
334190	liked it dislike if you disliked it stay 0
335870	subscribed for all the rest of our CES 0
337250	2018 content I did not suspect we would 0
339860	be doing this many power supply videos 0
341180	but everything's been really cool so far 0
342830	so yeah stay tuned I'll see you next 0
344719	time 0
