89	 Flying is expensive. Why is this? Most will say by the cost of fuel 0
5680	 but that's not quite right. The Airbus A320Neo can carry 24,000 liters of fuel. That is 0
12130	 as much as 376 Toyota Camry's that have been refueled. For every mile and a half that the A320 flies, 0
19130	 it consumes 6 liters of kerosene. That amounts to a void kilometer per 4 liters. An A320 0
26300	 can hardly fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Termal on those four liters 0
30600	 fuel. To fly the 340 kilometers from New York to DC, the A320 needs 1200 liters of fuel. 0
38690	 With that amount, our Toyota Camry can drive 49 times from New York to LA. But we also have to think 0
45190	 that our Camry has only 5 seats. An A320 has 154. So, assuming the plane 0
53420	 fully loaded, it has a fuel efficiency of 170 kilometers per four liters per person. 0
61500	 That is amazing! According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, airlines pay an average of only $ 1.24. 0
67979	 per four liters of fuel. So, you even use only $ 2.50 of fuel, flying from New York to DC, 0
75029	 so why do these tickets cost more than $ 80 ?! Well, there is a lot more 0
80749	 the ticket price then only determines fuel. Before we start I just want to say this 0
85009	 are already gross estimates. Many of these prices will vary greatly over time and there will be 0
89119	 certainly way in which airlines reduce these costs, but this gives you a general idea 0
92599	 what really makes flying so expensive. The first thing we can add to the airline ticket 0
97380	 are the costs of the crew. A pilot earns an average of $ 79,000 per year, which amounts to about $ 44 per flight hour. 0
104939	 We have two pilots for a one-hour flight from New York to DC 0
109999	 that's $ 88 for the pilots. A fully loaded A320 needs four flight attendants, 0
115539	 each Ã  about $ 38 per hour, for a total of $ 152, representing the total cost of the crew 0
122200	 $ 240 brings. So, with our 154 seats that comes down to about $ 1.50 per person in costs for the crew. 0
130288	 Okay, now we're at $ 4. Then we have to pay for the airports. 0
136540	 The JF Kennedy Airport in New York is asking for $ 6.33 per 500 kg plane that is taking off, and our A320 0
143790	 weighs 86,000 kilos. That means we pay $ 1089 in JFK, or over $ 7 per person 0
152180	 Dulles Airport does not show what its landing costs are, but we assume that it's about 0
155709	 the same as the landing costs at JFK for our 86,000 kilos aircraft. These costs 0
162680	 generally contain the costs of using gates, doormen and other facilities, and 0
167359	 come down to $ 13.50 per person. Our total is now $ 17.50. Now comes the nice part - taxes. 0
176040	 There is a long list of different taxes and they all vary per country, 0
180329	 so for convenience we only deal with those for the US. The easiest load is the 0
185049	 tax for domestic passenger transport at 7.5% of the ticket price. That money goes to the FAA. 0
191519	 If you land or take off at an airport in the countryside, defined as "an airport with less than 100,000 0
196219	 landings / starts during the second consecutive calendar year and is either 1) not located within 120 km 0
199799	 from another airport with 100,000+ takeoffs / landings per year, 2) receives essential aviation subsidies 0
203870	 or 3) is not connected to another airport connected by "a highway", then they also add 0
207709	 7.5% more. That is obviously not applicable for both airports. The FAA also brings 0
213920	 $ 4 for every flight within the US unless you fly to Hawaii or Alaska. Then they bring 0
219629	 $ 8.70 in charge. The TSA then adds $ 5.60 in taxes, called the "9/11 security tax" that is used 0
227249	 to pay for the increased security since 9/11. This is only for domestic flights. 0
231989	 If we were to fly from New York to Paris we would also pay $ 17.70 as 0
236889	 tax for international transport, $ 5.50 for customs costs, $ 5.00 for the 0
243389	 "Animal and plant health inspection", $ 7.00 for Immigration and Naturalization supplement 0
248430	 and $ 14 for the French Civil Aviation Tax. So, with all taxes and surcharges that apply 0
254529	 for this short flight we are now at $ 33 in total. Let's not forget that planes 0
260250	 expensive. Our A320 costs $ 170 million. The lifespan of aircraft is not really determined 0
266860	 by the number of flight hours, it is determined by something we call "flight cycles", 0
271210	 what the neat word is for one flight. It does not really matter how long it flies 0
275860	 in its lifetime, which is how often it has been under pressure. This is 0
280889	 because every time an aircraft has been under pressure micro cracks develop around the rivets 0
285280	 connect the metal plates to form the hull. Regardless of whether the aircraft flies for 30 minutes 0
290190	 or 9 o'clock, the wear and tear of the aircraft remains the same. This is why long-distance aircraft 0
295120	 usually older. They only go through one flight cycle per day 0
299599	 while small regional jets do 8 to 10. So, back to our A380. Our plane 0
305620	 is actually a relatively sustainable aircraft. It can fly up to 60,000 cycles. If we are the 0
311229	 dividing the total price of the aircraft by the maximum number of flight cycles, we arrive at $ 1783 0
318000	 per flight required to pay the aircraft. 0
322560	 Per person that comes down to $ 11.50. We are now at $ 44.50. To keep the plane safe, 0
330819	 airlines also have to do regular maintenance. For a one-hour flight, a society must 0
335660	 carry out maintenance at the cost of about $ 646 in working hours, $ 276 in parts, $ 603 in inspections and 0
344169	 and another $ 596 on repairs to the engine. That is $ 2121 in total or $ 14 per passenger. We sit 0
354069	 now at $ 58.50. We must also think of the part that is not flown. 0
360830	 Every airline has a company that is a company and incurs costs in itself. They pay 0
365349	 administrative staff, directors, software engineers, marketing staff, consultants, 0
370110	 customer service staff, PR staff, cleaners, but also rent, benefits, travel costs, 0
375430	 running costs and much more. It is difficult to put an exact amount on it and how much that costs 0
379690	 per person, but we make a conservative estimate of $ 10. We are now at $ 68.50. 0
386599	 OK, insurance. A company pays approximately $ 106,500 a year to insurance for an A320 and assuming that 0
393400	 our plane is in the air 8 hours a day, this hour costs $ 36, 0
398360	 or about 25 cents per person. So, our total amounts to $ 68.75. 0
404889	 We round this off to $ 70 because we are a few small things that I have not treated 0
409849	 such as hotel costs for the crew, aircraft storage, assistance, entitlement insurance, etc. 0
415930	 That means that 10 $ of the plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that my estimates 0
420810	 on the conservative side and that I assume that the device is completely full. Eventually it goes 0
425960	 not a lot of money to society. Back to my first sentence "Flying is expensive". 0
431099	 Well, actually it is not that expensive and it is also cheaper. To be able to fly in the magical iron bird over land 0
436319	 from New York to LA in 6 hours costs about $ 340 return. In our very economical 0
442800	 Toyota Camry to drive over land in 40 hours costs $ 340 alone 0
448659	 to fuel and then an estimated $ 300 in maintenance and depreciation costs. In the 0
454039	 last 30 years the ticket price for flying has dropped by 50% if you include the inflation, and the 0
459960	 is still falling. In 1974 it was illegal to offer a flight between New York 0
465240	 and LA ,. for less than $ 1442, including inflation, and now you can take these flights 0
471759	 sometimes l find for less than $ 200 return. One of the reasons for this reduction 0
476310	 in prices is the emergence of highly efficient aircraft. Some innovations such as plastic structures, 0
482229	 better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and, perhaps most importantly, winglets, have the costs 0
487909	 for flying significantly reduced. Here is the only real reason of "Real Engineering" 0
493120	 explain the winglets. 0
493439	 As you said, the aviation industry is constantly looking for ways to reduce the cost of their fuel consumption. 0
498050	 In the early 1970s fuel prices rose explosively, and engineers were obliged to find new ways 0
503180	 to make their aircraft more efficient. One of them was the winglets, those are those small ones 0
506909	 curved pieces at the end of the wing. Let's see how they work quickly. Winglets were 0
511000	 introduced to lower induced air resistance, which occurs when high pressure is under the wing 0
515510	 overflows to the low pressure above it. This flow creates swirls 0
520740	 the tips of the wings that create resistance and reduce the upward pressure, which in turn is the fuel efficiency 0
525080	 of the plane. Winglets are there to reduce these eddies through the airflow over the 0
529440	 edge of the wing. For a full explanation you have to look at the history of the winglets, go 0

544270	 If you like this channel, I guarantee you will like it too. I leave you with 0
549320	 the real reason why certain tickets are so expensive, but also a reason why they become cheaper - competition 0
553940	 or the lack of it. The aviation industry is one with very little competition. Ticket prices 0
559270	 from New York to LA are cheap because there is a lot of demand and there is relative 0
563590	 lots of competition. Five different airlines fly directly from New York to LA, two 0
569040	 of these are budget companies. People often do not care what society they fly with, they do 0
573920	 find the price more important, so companies will try to match the prices of the budget airlines. 0
578730	 Compare this with a route like Denver - Gunnison Country. Especially because only United 0
583630	 offering this flight will often cost you more than $ 500 for a flight of 210 km. 0
588980	 So, that's why tickets are so expensive. Next time you book a wicker, you will 0
594200	 know why you pay so much and how little of it actually goes to the airline. 0
