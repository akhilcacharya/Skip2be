30	Sup you beautiful bastards, hope you have a fantastic Monday 0
2680	Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it 0
6320	And the first thing we're gonna talk about today is the Super Bowl - kind of. 0
10040	Last night the New England Patriots played the Philadelphia Eagles - the Eagles won (!) 0
13560	It was huge. It was their first Super Bowl win ever and in response to this big win 0
18560	a good amount of people just went batshit crazy in Philadelphia 0
22040	you had around 100,000 people in the streets, there were just these pockets of craziness and destruction 0
27600	myself and around 10,000 other people were listening to a live police scanner in Philadelphia 0
32200	"We have a large, secondary crowd at clamoring at right in front of St Vincent's; chanting free Meek Mills and throwing bottles and cans" 0
40980	and the videos coming out of this thing! 0
43180	[you've got] people flipping cars, fires being set in the middle of the street, people tearing down light poles 0
48160	Then crowds carrying around parts of the light poles... Some people looting, destroying property 0
53580	these geniuses on top of this f*cking awning 0
55960	There's come people jumping then the thing just collapsed. 0
58780	There's a video of a guy eating a horse shit and people cheering him on (wut) 0
63420	I mean what we were seeing in a good number of places was - it was a riot 0
66240	But I also want to point out and give props to the people that weren't being a part of this 0
70600	and Adam Ferrone of Barstool Sports filmed a lot of it. 0
73280	you've got people chasing away looters, and some fans pleading that we're better than this 0
79640	So that said, I'll say congratulations to the Eagles; good job to those trying to defend their city 0
84940	And to the people destroying their own city because their f*cking team won 0
88140	you're a f*cking idiot - a fantastic job looking like the asshole you are 0
91260	Then we have some YouTube news; some awesome some interesting/concerning 0
95280	To start off with the awesome 0
96680	I want to talk about KSI and Joe Weller.  If you do not know they are massive creators on the platform 0
101380	On Saturday they had a livestream boxing match. They've been hyping it up for months 0
105580	I don't care about any of the drama stuff - whether it's fake or real 0
108280	Or any of the build-up. What I care about is that when they live streamed it at the height of it 0
113520	They had 1.6 million concurrent viewers 0
115740	This split between the two main live streams on their channels, the VOD the video on demand of those live streams 0
122020	after the fact as of recording this video 20.8 million views and those are just purely 0
126360	Insane and amazing numbers and regardless of who won - KSI did win the fight 0
131320	This is a big moment. It's a big moment for they're legitimizing what is happening online, the people that are behind it - Massive. 0
137320	So congrats and props to both those guys. 0
139040	and the other bit of YouTube news actually has to do with news itself 0
141760	YouTube announcing that if a news publisher is funded in part or in whole by a government 0
146040	They will now put a disclaimer underneath that video and so there are people that are happy 0
149500	But also people that are very concerned. A lot of people view news that is funded by a government to just be a propaganda machine 0
154740	Russia Today (RT) has blown up on YouTube, they have 2.2 billion views 0
159360	For transparency's sake that now gets a disclaimer 0
161560	AJ+ (al-jazeera plus) that will now get a disclaimer since they completely funded by Qatar 0
165840	So there are a lot of people cheering this move saying that it helps transparency 0
168980	It helps show people that maybe they should also look at other sources if they're watching this video 0
173120	you've also got people concerned because it's taking something like Russia today 0
176580	and putting it essentially in the same category as a PBS or a CBC and understandably PBS has some concerns with that 0
182820	A spokesperson of theirs, saying... 0
190640 0
193800 0
199700 0
201200	Now on that point I will say if there is a difference in the disclaimers. 0
204280	Russia today gets the disclaimer: "RT is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government" 0
208180	Whereas PBS gets the disclaimer "publicly funded American broadcaster" 0
211830	Which PBS's concern is still too vague. Their concerns seem to be YouTube's creating a situation where now they have to educate 0
217270	The viewer on something that's underneath all of their videos 0
219960	But with all of that said I do want to pass a question off to you 0
222360	Do you like this move; do you think that it helps transparency; it doesn't matter 0
226529	I'd love to know your thoughts. From that, I want to share some stuff I love today 0
229900	And today in awesome: the main bits of awesome today, we have our trailers, trailers on trailers 0
234780	We got Jurassic world: Fallen Kingdom. 0
236800	Mission Impossible. 0
238080	Fallout, Avengers: Infinity war. West world solo, A Star Wars story and then one of the trailers 0
243930	I got the most excited for was the Cloverfield paradigm. The new Cloverfield movie 0
247980	Not only because it was a trailer, but because they released it that night after the game on Netflix! 0
252840	I will say as a huge fan of Cloverfield; I was also a big fan of 10 Cloverfield Lane 0
257100	It's-it's the Paradox... (ugh) 0
259600	Paradox is the worst of the three. now keep in mind if you are a fan of the franchise, just go in with extremely low expectations 0
265600	You'll be fine, you'll be good, it ends with some questions, but at the same time a lot of just random stuff 0
270710	That is kind of unexplained happens 0
272660	That said I am at a point where I am worried about the franchise, the closest thing I can connect it to is if you were like a big fan of 0
277900	Paranormal activity right, I was a big fan of the first three movies in each one, there was something kind of unique and then it 0
283460	Kind of felt like there was it sh*t-show cash-grab 0
285500	And that's what I'm worried about, I even feel like I don't want to admit to myself how much I didn't like Paradox 0
291380	just because I am actually a fan of the franchise, and I want the next one to be better (struggles man I getchu) 0
295700	But that said I'm still putting this in TIA because the marketing around 0
299680	Showing a trailer and releasing it the same night. That's awesome. 0
303530	Although once again the cynic in my head is like yeah, it's awesome 0
305690	Or maybe it was their way to get around critics bashing an inferior movie. 0
309650	And if you want to see the full versions everything I just shared; the secret links of the day, anything at all - 0
313350	Links as always are in the description down below. And then let's talk about the Nunes memo 0
316760	We talked about the potential release of this memo last week, after I had already finished filming the Friday show, it was then released 0
322500	If you don't remember this revolves around Devin Nunes, the head of the House Intelligence Committee 0
326000	And it was claimed that this memo that he wrote detailed abuses in the use of the Foreign Intelligence 0
329880	Surveillance Act court process. Specifically taking aim at the FBI and the DOJ 0
334280	Regarding a FISA warrant they wanted for Carter Page. And the reason Carter Page matters is he's a former Trump campaign adviser 0
339710	And it was also suspected that he was working with the Russians. And so then of course as we talked about there are a lot of 0
343640	people saying release the memo we need this transparency, others saying no, that it's misleading 0
348660	it could potentially be harmful, the House Intelligence Committee has the numbers so they vote to release it, the White House, President Trump approve and 0
355520	They released it on Friday. I'll link to the full document down below 0
358010	But there are two very different 0
359790	reactions we see from this. We see Trump tweets "This memo totally vindicates "Trump" in probe. But the  Russian witch-hunt goes on and on 0
365780	There was no collusion and there was no obstruction ( the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, 0
370790	Collusion is dead. This is an American disgrace 0
373040	Also tweeting:"The top leadership and investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred 0
377940	investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans; something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. 0
383220	Rank and file are great people. What's being touted as a big bombshell moment 0
386140	In this memo by many people who support Donald Trump is around McCabe. The memo claims that then Deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe told 0
393020	The House Intelligence Committee that no FISA warrant would have been issued relating to one time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page without the Steele dossier 0
399710	That dossier put together by Christopher Steele, a former British spy secretly funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign 0
406230	Also noting that it wasn't explained who funded this venture.  But what the other side is saying is that we just have Nunes' word here. 0
412580	The actual FISA Court warrant is still classified and there are sources that said McCabe didn't say that 0
418040	Additionally saying the McCabe did disclose where the funding came from. 0
418540	So that creates a little bit of a he-said she-said situation, and we don't have the actual exact 0
424770	information because that is still classified. that brings us to what the FBI said before this release, that they have "grave concerns about material omissions of 0
431450	fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy" and after looking at the document that seems to be that it places too much 0
437580	Importance on the steel dossier. Also an important thing to note there is that the director of the FBI is not some 0
443130	foreign person trying to attack Donald Trump. The director of the FBI, the head of the FBI is 0
447750	Christopher Wray, a man that Donald Trump appointed. If the memo mentioning Trump adviser George Papadopoulos 0
451890	His mention's important because he's not mentioned in the steel dossier 0
455480	And he relates to this entire situation. Popped up on the FBI's radar 0
458340	Because reportedly he told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton emails 0
462949	He's now pled guilty to lying to the FBI, and he was working with Special Counsel. 0
466500	The memo also stating that Steele was desperate for Donald Trump not to be elected president 0
470750	They also found out there is more information about Carter Page outside of this memo.  Outside of this memo we found out that Carter page 0
475640	back in 2013 claimed that he was an informal adviser to the Kremlin (Moscow). Also on the note of Donald Trump saying that this totally vindicates him 0
482700	Three Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that voted for the memo to be released - they have pushed back against the president's claims 0
488160	Republican Trey Gowdy saying "the document has no effect on potential links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin." Also saying "he has complete confidence in 0
494480	FBI director Wray, Deputy attorney general Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller adding 0
498770	"There is a Russia investigation without a dossier" Republican Chris Stewart saying "I think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the Special Counsel 0
504990	Shouldn't complete his work. I support his work. I want him to finish it. I hope he finishes it 0
508370	as quickly as possible, the essence of this memo is something quite different" 0
511770	Republican Will Hurd saying "I would say that the DOJ and the FBI should continue doing their job 0
515929	I don't believe this is an attack on Bob Mueller 0
517880	I don't believe this is an attack on the men and women in the FBI 0
519980	I've served shoulder-to-shoulder with them, and they are hardworking folks that keep us safe" 0
523190	We're also now seeing the minority in the House Intelligence Committee, the Democrats wanting to put out their own memo. Main argument from the Democrats 0
528860	Is that there are missions that mislead the public there's more information to be shared 0
533209	The House Intelligence Committee is set to vote on whether to make that document public or not then that of course has to go to 0
538309	The president when it gets there we don't know what the president will do. Personally 0
541369	I will say now this bag has been opened with the Nunez memo. I think it is incredibly important 0
546379	we see what the other side has to say I mean if we're just playing the the public perception game that would look like 0
551749	The President is trying to hide something. 0
553279	Also on that note President Trump has Adam Schiff in his crosshairs. Schiff is a Democrat on the House Intelligence 0
557819	Committee that wrote the rebuttal memo and Donald Trump tweeted "little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the 0
563749	biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee 0
569000	Hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped." And so that's where we are as of right now. Now this situation 0
574240	changes later today. We don't know what's going to happen with a vote in the House Intelligence Committee although 0
578509	There are some signs pointing to things looking good for an approval. And even if it is approved it then goes to Trump's desk 0
584540	What happens there, we don't know what Trump will do.  I will say personally 0
586939	I am of the mindset of I would love to see more information so I could see both arguments 0
591769	That said I will say I am somewhat skeptical 0
594829	While I have no doubt that people in the FBI the 0
597120	the DOJ have their personal preferences their personal biases 0
600240	when I look back to what was happening to say that the FBI was weaponized to go against Donald Trump 0
604820	It feels like you have to willfully forget that the FBI is also the reason, but most likely a big part of the reason why Hillary Clinton lost the election 0
613440	You might not remember but the FBI was incredibly vocal about everything Hillary Clinton 0
618180	Especially the second time which turned out to be like 'oh actually these are all the same emails, never mind' even though people are doing 0
624110	Early voting and so that's why for me personally it feels weird especially with 0
627389	Republicans who voted for the release saying it doesn't show what a lot of people are saying it shows. I just want more information 0
632299	But I will pass a question off to you. What are your thoughts around all of this? 0
635329	I'll link to the full Nunez memo down below. What I'm trying to do here is to simplify it for the for the sake of time 0
640620	and getting the message across. What was your takeaway; was this huge, was that it a dud? 0
644249	Do you want to see more information come out or no they're going to mislead any and all thoughts 0
649429	I want to know what you're thinking in those comments down below. Then over the weekend 0
652220	We saw Uma Thurman speak out against both Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino. On Weinstein 0
657379	She says she met him after pulp fiction came out saying "I knew him pretty well before he attacked me 0
661400	He used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me 0
665820	Possibly he made me overlook warning signs, this was my champion 0
668620	I was never any kind of studio Darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me 0
673270	She then describes a night in Paris where she says the two were arguing over a script 0
676930	He then changes the subject leads her to a sauna. He's in a bathrobe 0
680200	She says she didn't feel threatened, but she did say "This is ridiculous, what are you doing?" 0
683320	Saying she left, but then said not long after that she was in a hotel in London when he attacked her. Thurman saying "it was such a bat 0
688390	to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself 0
692260	He did all kinds of unpleasant things 0
693970	But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard 0
697960	I was doing anything I could to get the train back on track.My track. Not his track." 0
701740	She then says at a later time when she confronted him about this 0
704320	He gave a half-assed apology. Now in response to these claims a Weinstein spokesperson said 0
709570	Mr. Weinstein acknowledge is making an awkward past 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals after a 0
714680	flirtatious exchange in Paris, 0
716050	Which he immediately apologized and deeply regret. However her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue and this is the first time we have heard 0
722350	those details. This is the first time we are hearing that she considered 0
725300	Mr. Weinstein an enemy and the pictures of their history tell a completely different story 0
728560	So there is that part of the story and response and then there was what happened on the set of Kill Bill. During the scene 0
733540	Where she's driving the convertible to kill bill she found out that she was being asked to drive the car herself 0
738280	She said she was told by one of the Teamsters that the car might not be working that well 0
741310	And she didn't feel comfortable driving it and she says at that point "Quentin came in my trailer and didn't like to hear no like 0
746290	any director. He was furious because I'd cost them a lot of time, but I was scared" 0
749980	He said "I promise you the car is fine. It's straight piece of Road." She says Quentin convinces her to do it 0
754300	It's going to be simple enough 0
755240	And then he says "hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won't blow the right way 0
759040	and I'll make you do it again." and she says, but that was a death box I was in. 0
761710	The seat wasn't screwed down properly 0
763780	It was a sand road, and it was not a straight road." Also all these years later 0
767320	We now have footage of the car crash 0
769930	She is driving down a straight part of the road 0
772060	But then it turns to the right and you immediately see her start to lose control 0
776290	And then BOOM. Describing the incident Thurman said "the steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me. 0
782260	I felt the seething pain, and thought Oh My God 0
784420	I'm never going to walk again, and as far as how Uma got this footage 0
787630	She said she fought for 15 years. 0
789610	Initially she said when she tried to obtain it Miramax said we'll give it to you 0
792400	But you'll have to sign a contract that releases us from quote "any 0
795200	consequences of my future pain and suffering" She fought for a really long time and then after 15 years, 0
799700	Quentin Tarantino just gave her the footage 0
801660	But she said that wasn't the only horrible moment. For a scene in the movie where Uma Thurman gets spit on, reportedly that was Quentin Tarantino 0
807240	Also in one of the scenes where she's being choked with a chain reportedly that was Tarantino 0
810829	and while it does appear that she has issue with Tarantino 0
814149	She posted something today that makes it seem like it's a lot more than that. Tarantino writing 0
818619	"He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm 0
821199	And I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage. Quentin Tarantino was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about 0
826839	This sorry event adding the cover up after the fact is unforgivable. For this. I hold Lawrence Bender 0
831790	E. Bennett Walsh and the notorious Harvey Weinstein's solely responsible. They lied, destroyed evidence and continued to lie about the permanent harm 0
838420	they caused and then chose to suppress. The cover-up did have malicious intent and shame on these three for all eternity 0
843799	CAA never sent anyone to Mexico 0
846100	I hope they look after other clients more respectfully if they in fact want to do the job for which they take money with any decency 0
851520	and as of recording this video Tarantino has not made a comment. But I do want to pass the question off to you 0
856119	"What are your thoughts on this situation?" 0
