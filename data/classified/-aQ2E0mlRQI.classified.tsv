0	if you've ever looked at a flight 0
1319	tracker sometime around 10:00 or 11:00 0
2909	p.m. Eastern you might have noticed 0
5009	something perfect lines of planes 0
6960	stretching all the way to Europe these 0
9599	are just some of the over 2000 daily 0
12269	flights that cross the northern Atlantic 0
13679	with so many flights there just has to 0
16350	be organization this is the most direct 0
18779	route from New York to London you may 0
20730	think it's this a straight line but that 0
23400	straight line isn't actually a straight 0
25109	line this curved line is a straight line 0
27180	because despite what some may think the 0
29340	earth is curved from New York to London 0
31349	the curve you see on a flat map isn't 0
32910	too extreme but in the case of a longer 0
34890	flight such as from New York to Bangkok 0
36899	the most direct route is not this but 0
39420	this straight over the North Pole it 0
42000	makes a lot more sense if you look at a 0
43350	North Pole oriented map if you draw the 0
45420	most direct route between Atlanta and 0
47160	London you'll see that it passes over 0
48960	every major East Coast International 0
50850	Airport that means that planes from 0
52379	Atlanta to Europe travel on the exact 0
54449	same route as planes from Charlotte 0
56190	Washington Baltimore Philadelphia New 0
58469	York and Boston all these transatlantic 0
60480	planes typically leave between 6 &amp; 8 0
62760	p.m. Eastern to time their arrival for 0
64830	early morning in Europe that means that 0
66510	there are potentially hundreds of planes 0
68189	all going the exact same route at the 0
70200	exact same time the North Atlantic also 0
72510	has something known as the jet stream 0
73650	these easterly winds average around 110 0
76560	miles per hour and if planes fly in them 0
78600	they can cut hours off their travel time 0
80640	however the winds are only strongest in 0
83280	a line three miles high and 100 miles 0
85560	wide that further concentrates the 0
87869	flights on average an eastbound 0
89729	transatlantic flight from New York to 0
91290	London takes about six hours and 15 0
93329	minutes coming back against the jet 0
95189	stream the same flight takes over seven 0
97290	hours sometimes the winds can be even 0
99689	more active such as on January 8th 2015 0
102720	when British Airways flight 114 flew 0
104909	from New York to London in only five 0
106649	hours and 16 minutes a new record for a 0
109380	commercial subsonic plane on that day 0
111570	the jet stream was blowing over 200 0
113880	miles per hour and the Boeing triple7 0
115320	reached a speed of 745 miles per hour 0
119009	only 16 miles per hour below the sound 0
121560	barrier so when winds can cut an hour 0
123570	off a flight and a triple seven burns 0
125630	2,700 gallons of fuel per hour and jet 0
128310	fuel costs a dollar in 89 cents per 0
130080	gallon 0
130530	that's a 5103 dollar difference 0
133650	between being in the right and the wrong 0
135150	wins hopefully you now see why this is 0
137189	important so there are all these planes 0
139019	that are flying the exact same route but 0
140730	usually that's no problem the busiest 0
142739	route in North America New York to 0
144510	Chicago sees over 100 flights per day 0
146970	leaving as frequently as every five 0
148799	minutes during the morning and evening 0
150000	rush and these planes just fly the most 0
151980	efficient route before the flight route 0
153900	planners file a plan with air traffic 0
155640	control and during the flight 0
157049	they're just directed by air traffic 0
158519	control in a way that keeps some five 0
160379	nautical miles from other planes the 0
162359	difference between New York to Chicago 0
164069	and New York to London is that over the 0
166349	North Atlantic 0
167099	there is no radar you see radar only 0
169920	extends about 250 miles offshore 0
172079	transatlantic planes can be more than a 0
174239	thousand miles from shore that's why 0
176489	every morning the route planner is at 0

221790	Newfoundland Canada in most cases 0
223530	clearance is given and soon after will 0
225599	take off about when the plane crosses 0
227489	the Gulf of st. Lawrence the pilot will 0

233220	day's routes over the Atlantic after 0
234750	looking over this the pilot decides to 0

240900	Raffin waypoint our oceanic entry point 0
243180	waypoints are fixed spots that are used 0

255659	New Hampshire there's ham burger and 0
257849	fries on approach to Kansas City Airport 0
260459	there's spicy barbeque turkey smoked 0

266440	Cubs and bears some Waypoint names are 0
268660	more somber on the northern approach 0

281470	the modem just gives the entry and exit 0

289570	reason to name them as waypoints since 0
291340	they won't be given over radio in the 0
292900	case of this flight we're requesting 0
294160	track whiskey and more than likely 0
296080	Gander Control Center will give us 0
297730	permission although sometimes they'll 0
299350	tell us to take a different track 0
300460	usually because we're closer to another 0
302080	plane than the minimum separation 0
303340	distance since it's much more difficult 0
305110	to know where planes are over the North 0
306790	Atlantic they're required to be 15 0
308560	minutes separated about 140 miles rather 0
311200	than the normal 5 miles in areas with 0
313090	radar coverage assuming we're granted 0
314980	clearance we'll head towards the RAF and 0
316420	Waypoint and make sure that our 0
317530	satellite communication systems are 0
319090	working then we'll check to see if our 0
320500	high-frequency radio is working a backup 0
322660	in case other communications go down 0
324190	minutes later just after passing RAF and 0

330880	and we're on our own 0
332919	all the North Atlantic tracks are 0
334720	pre-loaded onto autopilot so there's 0
336520	really nothing to do except wait when we 0
338890	hit 30 degrees west will enter the 0
340780	shanwick airspace approaching Western 0
342520	Europe we switch our radios to shanwick 0
