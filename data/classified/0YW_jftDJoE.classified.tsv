0	this video from CES 2018 is brought to 1
2159	you by the symbiote demo car from group 1
3899	Renault we'll have that linked in the 1
5700	video description so we're here in the 1
9090	asus rog suite where they've got a ton 0
11849	of amazing display technology on display 0
15690	first up is their 144 hertz 4k HDR 0
19470	gaming monitor that we actually saw 0
22320	demoed like a year ago the PG 2 7uq but 0
27539	the key difference is that they are 0
29130	actually going to be shipping this thing 0
30660	really soon so that's a large 27-inch 0
33660	g-sync display 144 hertz 4k pretty much 0
37739	can't go wrong unless of course you're 0
39600	into ultra wide gaming in which case 0
41219	might be more into the PG 35 VQ so 0
45149	that's a 34 40 by 1440 35 inch g-sync 0
50239	200 Hertz display so that is double the 0
53820	refresh rate of the predator x34 one of 0
56850	my personal favorite gaming displays 0
60050	also here is a Seuss's flavor oven 0
62969	videos BFG TV display what are they 0
67530	calling it yeah yeah BFG D or big format 0
72210	gaming display I don't think they have a 0
74130	model name for it yet but in a nutshell 0
76020	it's a 65 inch monitor effectively 0
80280	because it doesn't have a TV tuner but 0
82500	it does have a lot of features that are 0
83939	appealing to gamers so it uses a VA 0
85799	panel with a three thousand to 1 0
87299	contrast ratio it runs out a hundred and 0
89610	twenty Hertz 4k resolution with HDR and 0
93000	it has a built-in Nvidia shield so you 0
96150	can play Android games you can stream 0
98130	Netflix Amazon Prime 0
99720	etc but most importantly they're 0
102270	boasting ultra-low latency so if you're 0
104759	a couch gamer that looks like it's going 0
107070	to be the solution sometime later this 0
109799	year the most visually interesting one 0
113130	though is probably this guy now on the 0
115890	surface this looks pretty boring it's 0
119490	just like a couple of rubber pieces at 0
122159	the top and bottom and then it's a strip 0
124770	of PMMA which is a plastic material 0
126950	similar to acrylic but what's special 0
130199	about it 0
131510	is the Fresnel style lenses that are cut 0
135290	into it so traditionally the way to 0
137989	achieve bending of light would be to 0
140480	have like a big bubble lens but instead 0
142430	this just has a bunch of slits cut into 0
145069	it all along kind of similar to the 0
147319	rings that you see inside of an HTC vive 0
149959	and what it does is if you put it on top 0
153049	of the bezels of Zeus's PG 2 v 8 q 0
156769	gaming monitor it makes them essentially 0
159799	disappear by stretching the edge of this 0
162349	screen and the edge of this one creating 0
165319	a bezel effect now it's not perfect you 0
168709	do lose a little bit of light so they 0
170959	are a little bit dimmer but I will say 0
173150	that if you're into sim racing the 0
175129	experience is significantly more 0
177200	immersive they're optimized for a 0
179269	hundred and thirty degree angles and 0
180889	they're working on getting it working 0
182389	with the PG 35 V Q and pricing is 0
185239	expected to be able they don't know but 0
186920	they're saying under $100 which like I 0
190370	would hope so but like that seems pretty 0
193670	reasonable if you're into surround 0
194930	gaming so there you go I took apart 0
198199	their demo anyway this video was brought 1
202400	to you guys by the symbiote demo car 1
204079	from group Renault we checked it out 1
205819	quite recently it's their level 4 1
208250	autonomous car that I actually got to 1
210410	drive and I use the term drive with a 1
213500	serious asterisk on it because we 1
216019	managed to take it out on the freeway 1
218620	with my hands completely off the wheel 1
221299	the seat tilted back and then at its 1
223459	most extreme with a VR headset on that 1
227449	was actually simulating what it would be 1
230269	like if I was in a completely different 1
232250	environment whatsoever with the car 1
234379	sensors themselves tied into the VR 1
238099	headset so you guys are gonna want to 1
240349	check out that video to see the latest 1
