 Anna (Destin), Welcome to 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.110
 I am very passionate about rockets. You probably know this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.170
 right Now. But the reason is that my grandfather was working for NASA, and he knew me 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.340
 With rockets. I knew since that moment when my feet that I wanted to explore 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.530
 Space, I want to be an astronaut. That's what we did. Says my hero 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.710
 For whom I gave much much needed, and I grew up under it. I have given 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.890
 Lots. So we realize that there are people who do not even know what rockets are. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.070
 So I and my friend, we have done. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.250
 It took us a year and a half of planning and implementation, but we took the rockets to the people 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
 They have not seen missiles before. But the first thing we had to do, is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.590
 And to know how rockets are capable of reaching the smallest country in Africa. 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.140
 We have a Class B missile 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.170
 The Estes model will work to make it fly and allow these children to learn more about 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.850
 Science, mathematics and technology. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.470
 So that the buns can remain upright 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.610
 You have to be fast moving, before you have to hold it upright 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.660
 The answer is science, okay. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 When the teacher is ready to launch, we will count down. 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 What we do when firing rockets is counting down from 5 to zero. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 1 .. zero 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.260
 This is the installation 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.810
 Gambian Space Program. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.380
 Launching 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.700
 Did you see that? Look, let me take the shot again, watch this boy 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.880
 Here exactly. This boy. Ignore others. It has a historical moment 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.060
 It is the first time that this child has seen a rocket in his entire life. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.660
 Did you like that? 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.820
 Do you remember how it happened to you? Well, this is the deal, you have been given a lot 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.010
 Of the opportunities not enjoyed by many others in the world. 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.200
 For those who gave a lot, much is required of him. What have you given? 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.370
 So Stevo and I had a plan to get enthusiasm and passion for engineering, technology and mathematics, and that was a cornerstone in starting 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.570
 Gambian space program process is simple, what will you do? 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.730
 Tell us and then follow us until you become smarter every day. (I'm Destin). Bye 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.870
 5 .. 4 .. 3 .. 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.050
 2 .. 1 .. Launch! 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.580
