00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.008
 Translation: khjl proofreading: khjl timeline: khjl this video I have been looking forward to for a long time 

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.022
 Shoot the visual silencer with a high-speed camera 

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:06.095
 How are you? 

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:11.097
 However, I did not have any documents or firearms to shoot this video 

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.022
 Until I met Steve 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.042
 Hello everyone, I am Destin 

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.067
 Welcome to smart everday 

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.090
 This is Steve, who made the muffler, is that right? 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.025
 (Steve: That's right) 

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:21.025
 What's your company's name? 

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:22.017
 Soteria 

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.027
 Soteria silencer 

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:28.052
 We all look forward to shooting this video 

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:30.080
 Steve is from Alabama 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.008
 We are related to each other 

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:34.065
 He spotted my high-speed camera 

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:36.092
 I saw his visual muffler 

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:38.027
 So after he agreed 

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:39.095
 We will take what we need here 

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:41.007
 So what to do next? 

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:48.007
 We'll use a muffler with an acrylic shell to fire a bullet 

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.030
 In order to clearly see the launch of the process 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.070
 Bullets flew out of the barrel 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.015
 Blast and flames follow 

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:03.010
 What happened in the silencer? 

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.055
 The bullet came after the end of the barrel 

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:07.052
 Muzzle to form a gradually expanding shock wave 

00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:11.072
 Then in the end the microphone, right? (Yes) 

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:16.092
 I do not expect this shock wave to be spherical or symmetrical 

00:01:16.092 --> 00:01:19.037
 The shape should be similar to the leaf, right? 

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.077
 More like an inverted mushroom 

00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:21.092
 Flip mushrooms? 

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:25.090
 If I turn the muzzle brake off 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:35.000
 When the bullet flies out of the barrel, you can see a reverse mushroom (wow, awesome) 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.095
 The moment I've been waiting 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.002
 This is Teflon ring 

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:43.090
 Is there anything Steve wants to say? 

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.000
 I have to be completely honest 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.025
 I never fired a .308 bullet using a muffler with an acrylic shell 

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:52.037
 I know the shell may be broken # Puno I know he wants to make this breakthrough 

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:56.012
 I guess: if the shell really failed 

00:01:56.012 --> 00:02:00.088
 Rupture may begin with a threaded bottom or top 

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.095
 Taking into account the size of the pressure 

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.025
 What thread do you use? 

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.027
 Is the more sharp thread? 

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:09.042
 This is a blunt thread, thinner 

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:10.044
 Hope it will not burst it 

00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:11.060
 But if it is 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.037
 We might get some more 6 shots 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.040
 let's go 

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:24.080
 I want the shell to crack as expected 

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:50.050
 My engineering professor did not lie 

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:51.085
 Have you seen such a picture? 

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:52.077
 Never seen before 

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:56.052
 Never seen anyone shoot such a picture 

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:57.067
 Mumford people 

00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:59.030
 What is "Mumford people"? 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.067
 Mumford USA! 

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:01.052
 Mumford Alabama 

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:02.035
 Mumford USA 

00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:03.065
 I do not know what it means 

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:06.028
 This will become an unsolved mystery 

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.007
 But we designed it 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.030
 Axial pressure makes the shell off 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.010
 Squeeze gas silencer 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.077
 The shell thread can not withstand this pressure, right? (Yes) 

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:23.030
 The next experiment we are selling is (yes) 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.027
 And you have not seen this slow motion (yes) 

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:26.077
 Interesting 

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.047
 This is a .223 caliber Remington bullet 

00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:31.090
 The principle of silencing is to store gas in the back of the silencer 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.035
 Use the previous diamond structure to stop the gas 

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:37.012
 Fire! 

00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:45.087
 If you want to analyze the role of muffler 

00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:46.098
 Here is divided into two steps 

00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:51.052
 The first step is to capture the gas inside and reduce the volume of the explosion 

00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:53.077
 The second is to limit the flow of gas 

00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:57.005
 Ensure that the gas stays in the silencer to prevent diffusion 

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:02.075
 Fire! 

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:38.010
 When you spend a lot of time designing a product 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.064
 Things get cool 

00:04:39.064 --> 00:04:41.024
 When you see the product 

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:44.005
 You will have an engineer-style intuition 

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:47.027
 In the following silencer, steve has the intuition 

00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:48.034
 Before we pulled the trigger 

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:50.025
 You can hear him say: It will be very interesting 

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:52.017
 He wants to shoot this video 

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:55.020
 I also want to shoot this video, because this idea is the best in my mind 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.002
 I can see a lot of gas 

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:58.062
 Steve did not tell me from the very beginning 

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:00.048
 This muffler is his company does not have much research time 

00:05:00.048 --> 00:05:03.005
 Introduced one of the first few concept designs 

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.092
 He also did not tell me that he did not intend to use this to shoot 

00:05:05.092 --> 00:05:09.004
 So its acrylic shell is a thin demo version 

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:11.058
 There are some claw-shaped structures inside 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:16.078
 It's like trying to grab the gas and keep the gas away 

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:18.036
 So it should still be good 

00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:20.017
 Ready to shoot 

00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:23.020
 Fire! 

00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:27.072
 ... 

00:05:30.092 --> 00:05:32.010
 Why do not you tell me! 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.037
 I said it's unfortunate that I confessed that I had not tried it 

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.080
 this is my favourite! 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.010
 This is my favorite design! 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.007
 You know ... How do you know that it will break? Wish to hear the details 

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:48.025
 Well, this is a small silencer for .308 

00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:50.010
 This system works well on .2 to .3 inch bullets 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.070
 But .308 bullets need more capacity 

00:05:52.097 --> 00:05:56.030
 Need 41 mm muffler 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.010
 Not 35mm 

00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:24.032
 This is an experiment that can promote development 

00:06:24.032 --> 00:06:25.080
 So let's see what we can learn from it 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.004
 Different from the previous segmentation system 

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:30.040
 This muffler uses a single stage system 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.032
 In order to better clean the battlefield 

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.055
 We fired another time without a shell 

00:06:35.055 --> 00:06:37.077
 In order to see exactly what happened 

00:06:38.025 --> 00:06:41.074
 As you can see, these flat parts begin to bend from the inside to the outside 

00:06:41.074 --> 00:06:44.010
 Then bounced back into the sleeve 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.060
 The formation of internal stress 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.062
 This test is called destructive testing 

00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:50.072
 Is one of the areas that I'm most interested in in engineering 

00:06:50.097 --> 00:06:53.008
 Steve apparently knows the shell will break 

00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:54.037
 If we use a metal shell 

00:06:54.037 --> 00:06:55.040
 Nothing will happen 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.026
 But Steve deliberately weakened a part of the system 

00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:01.015
 In order to observe the structural strength of the rest of the system 

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:02.010
 Understand this later 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.097
 You can learn how to modify the entire design 

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:08.044
 And then to create a solid but not bulky products 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.052
 This idea is very clever, engineers have been doing so 

00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:14.017
 And this is my favorite part of engineering 

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:17.060
 This is the main content of this issue, very cool 

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:20.097
 Today I have a sponsor to introduce to you 

00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:22.007
 This is not a normal advertisement 

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:24.092
 This is a big news for Sandlin household 

00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:30.030
 We hope Hello fresh will continue to sponsor agitation every day 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.095
 I mentioned this to my wife and my podcast 

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:36.085
 I revisited how we got in touch with Hello fresh 

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:39.035
 So how did this begin? 

00:07:39.035 --> 00:07:42.075
 I subscribed to Hf's meal plan during the Christmas season 

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:47.007
 In order to reduce the time for planning or shopping during the New Year 

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:52.037
 There are many companies that have consulted on a pan-generosity day by day and include some companies in the food planning category 

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:56.022
 Yes, and there are also meal plan companies who have sent us samples 

00:07:56.022 --> 00:08:00.062
 But I do not like the design of their meals or the type of food 

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:04.090
 Finally, I still pay Hf, this is better 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.080
 We are looking forward to Hf sponsorship pandemic every day 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.072
 This has a great impact on our family 

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.080
 My eldest son likes to learn cooking 

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.037
 And happy to help his mother in the kitchen 

00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:16.087
 Hf ready to cook the material, delivered directly to your door 

00:08:16.087 --> 00:08:19.015
 Make sure the ingredients are perfect and prevent waste 

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:23.082
 My wife and I like to go out and buy food without going through the shopping list 

00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:25.025
 We just put the ingredients onto the stove one by one 

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:29.035
 Cooking guide is very detailed, and there is a suggestion card 

00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:30.067
 Perfect for our family 

00:08:30.067 --> 00:08:33.072
 As long as ten knives per meal below, within 30 minutes to complete 

00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:37.047
 Go to HelloFresh.com and use coupon code "smarter" 

00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:40.050
 You can get the first week for the 30 knife discount coupons 

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.050
 Very cost-effective 

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.057
 This is the use of beans spell into the discount code 

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:47.027
 Go to the official website to buy buy it 

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.022
 The last few things 

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:50.065
 I am very excited about the next video 

00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:52.000
 Not concerned, if the screen is OK 

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.140
 Attention &amp; subscription / coin / collection / point recommendation 

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.037
 Another thing if you want to see more original footage of high-speed photography 

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.097
 Follow the Affiliate Channel Smarter Every Day 2 

00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:00.080
 Acoustic design for Gordon McGladdery 

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.062
 And more slow motion 

00:09:03.062 --> 00:09:05.060
 Go take a look, still very flirtatious 

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.090
 Say goodbye to Steve 

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.065
 Well, this is all content 

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.040
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.047
 Thanks again to Steve from Soteria 

00:09:11.047 --> 00:09:12.087
 Let us take this video 

00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:14.085
 You're welcome, I hope you can enjoy this video 

00:09:14.085 --> 00:09:17.037
 We have to do some research here 

00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:20.052
 We'll get some data, experiment based on facts, what do you think? 

00:09:20.052 --> 00:09:21.017
 I have confidence 

00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:24.047
 Keep improving 

00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:27.085
 I am Destin, every day a little bit more, we see you later 

00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:37.032
 I do not translate if I do not understand 

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:43.036
