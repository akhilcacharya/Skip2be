00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hey, I am in Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You know you have problems 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.500
 when you have to disassemble the Tinkertoys to explain a concept. What will you build 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.680
 (son) Ducks of Tinkertoy, fish and wheel on your ham. [??] 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.870
 Good idea. What will you do? (Daughter) The sunset. The sunset 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050
 OK, because we will start building. Come in. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.320
 OK, here at Smarter Every Day we are in the middle of a series about how helicopters work, and yes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.400
 Remember, I told you at first that helicopters are very complicated. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 So here is the Tinkertoy helicopter I just made, and if you remember the other videos, 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 I told you that the shovels of the helicopter, as they rotate, 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.950
 They have the ability to change their way as they turn around 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.140
 to the rotor's disk. Now, this is called a cyclical step, and if not 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.330
 You understand this concept, you have to look at this video so you remember 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.510
 of what I am talking about. Well, we assume we understand well how it works. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 This is the question. If I have a helicopter i 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 I just want to maneuver so that the helicopter leans forward in this way, 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.030
 How do I change the incline of the rotor's disk? In other words that is, 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.210
 For me the logic would be to raise the part of the back of the disk 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 so that would add a lot of ascension here, and that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 he would lean forward. This for me makes sense. Does it make sense for you? 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.400
 Well, here's the question. You are totally wrong if you have it. And here you have 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 because. Actually you are ascensional to the side 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.770
 from the helicopter and this slopes the helicopter forward. 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.880
 The first time I noticed, I got caught up very much, simply because I did not have any intuition 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.060
 sense, but it has something to do with this device that I have here. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.250
 Maybe you've seen some before. A gyroscope is called. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.420
 Well, what has this to do with the helicopters? If you think about it, 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.610
 It's a great mass turning very fast. Look 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.730
 the helicopter What do we have above? It's a big mass, 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.900
 turning very fast. So when the rotors are aligned with the body 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.090
 from the helicopter, if we wanted to tilt the body of the helicopter 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.300
 Come on like this, I would wait for that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.390
 We were in the right phase right here, and I would hope that we would take a little less with this rotor and something more with 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.510
 This rotor to get it is ... how? (Carl) That does not happen. 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.700
 It seems that this should be so, but because of precession 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
 gyroscopic, any force on a rotating disk, and these shovels 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.060
 act as a disc, it has an effect in a phase of 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.240
 90 degrees. So if we make a force here, push down 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 or up to tilt the helicopter forward, it will actually take 90 ° 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.500
 Then, and will tilt the side helicopter. So that to lean forward 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.670
 We add step to the shovel when it is 90 degrees before 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.850
 to arrive at .. (Destin) Oh, so it's like ... It's almost like predicting the future 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 or something like that. (Carl) Something like that. (Destin) So, if I want to tilt the helicopter 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.220
 I'll take a little while when I'm outdated 90 degrees 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
 And I would add a bit there, and would that incline? (Carl) Sip, so 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.610
 the shovel pushes up here. This pushes down, and this has 90º effect 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.800
 Then, when it is in parallel with the machine, and the machine inclines, in this way. 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.990
 If. I do not understand either. 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.170
 In fact, a Smithsonian ex-driver explained to me 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.350
 personally, and I still do not understand it. Controlling 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.540
 90 degrees before, on the cyclic platter. (Destin) As with everything a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 Smarter Every Day, I finally understood it when I did an experiment myself. 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.910
 Okay, because Carl and I have prepared a high tech experiment with 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.090
 bike wheels The Wright brothers did it. It's enough for me if it's enough for them. 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.220
 And we have a camera aligned with the device 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.330
 of force application, which is a strip of metal, 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.410
 Do you want to explain what is happening there? (Carl) Okay, we'll do ... (Destin) Wait! 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.580
 I'm better off, forward. (Carl) We will apply 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.760
 a force, straight up, and how you can see it here 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.960
 the tire leans in the same plane where we move the bar. 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.140
 But when you turn, the same will not happen. (Destin) Let's face ... just try it out. 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.330
 Here we go. I used to play with my exercise machine 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.500
 Mom when I was 5 years old, so I am highly qualified to apply angular momentum 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.590
 here. 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.870
 Angular momentum applied! Put the brakes 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.050
 (Carl) I try to control that. (Destin) OK. (Carl) Well, now 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.220
 we will do the same test again. We will apply a force straight up, here. 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.400
 I ... incline, 90 degrees after the place where we apply force. 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.480
 (Destin) Okay, that's why it's called prec. [Your] precession 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.580
 gyroscopic, and basically means applied forces 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.720
 perpendicular to the plane of rotation, act out of phase 90 ° respect 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.880
 the point of application. I think it's pretty interesting. Well, I have a rotation plan 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.080
 of strength here, but in reality it acts in this plan. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.250
 And if you look at the horizon, where does the camera look when it goes up, it rolls? 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.440
 other way round. Mola bastante! Anyway, 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.640
 Is this. This is why the blades of the helicopter operate out of phase 90 °. 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.810
 Want to add something? It's been the fact that I've been kneeling all over the place 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.000
 a cookie of horse? Hey, horse. What do you know about the 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.170
 gyroscopic precession? [silence] What I thought. [laugh] 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.350
 I know this was one of the most complicated videos and I hope you understand it. If you like, leave me some 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.540
 Comment and tell me, to know how to explain things better in the future. 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.720
 Also, if you are interested, subscribe, because next week we will discuss it 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.860
 speed limit of helicopters, and it is not for the FAA. It's physical 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.030
 I'm in Destin. Get smarter every day.
