00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 OK, this video is probably not suitable for children, and it is 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.001
 uh ... It's insane, in many different ways. 

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.002
 And certainly if you are a man. So, as you know, 

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.003
 on Smarter Every Day I try to keep everything intelligent and respectful, but this one 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.004
 video is crazy. You have to think carefully whether you want to watch this or not. 

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.005
 Because now that I know this happens, I have nightmares. 

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.006
 And they are not good ... [laughs] They are not good nightmares, you know? 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.007
 So think carefully whether you want to know this information or not. Do you want to know? 

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.008
 OK ... Introduction. 

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.499
 - Talk to me. Give an introduction now. [DESTIN]: Hello, this is Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 I am in the Amazon rainforest. [scream like a little girl] - [laugh] [blows] Yes! 

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:48.001
 - Now that we are talking about the penis tree, what he does is: 

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.002
 well ... yes. This is ... actually the 

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:56.003
 number 3 most poisonous spider on the world. 

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.000
 Phoneutria fera. 

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.001
 I will stay so far away. - They are very aggressive 

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:05.002
 Do we have to look at how aggressive they are? 

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:12.003
 - Okay, he probably jumps down, but we're trying to get him to pose better for the camera. 

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.004
 - Oh .. Oh, no she goes ... [DESTIN]: Wow, he's fast 

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.005
 - Who is going to do him on his face? - No! 

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.006
 - Do it. - OK. - He also causes a problem in men, called a priapism 

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.007
 [DESTIN]: Priapism. Oh yes, ice water enema to treat that? - Yeah. 

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:32.008
 OK, this spider is called the Brazillian Wandering Spider (Phoneutria). And if you listened to what Phil said, 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.009
 you heard that it causes a problem in men. I assume that this does not apply to women. 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 And there are few things I can think of that happen only to men, and not to women. 

00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.011
 But we'll come back to that. 

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:44.012
 - If you look under that front leg, you see the tires. Black, white and black. 

00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:48.003
 Can you see that from that angle? Do you see it? - Yes. 

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:57.500
 - So when he gets very angry, he throws it in the air, and then you see that black-white-black-white. 

00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:00.001
 That's kind of a warning sign. 

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:04.002
 [DESTIN]: Is it a Wandering Spider (Kamspin)? - Yes 

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.503
 - Because he does not make webs? - Correct. 

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:09.503
 [DESTIN]: Well, at least I'm done with the number 3 most poisonous spider in the world. 

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:14.000
 - But is she ready with you? - That is the question. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 [DESTIN]: OK, then you are walking in the jungle, and then an entomologist tells you that this spider can affect your penis. 

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.001
 Of course you immediately grab the books, and you find out 

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:25.002
 that priapism is a medical emergency that has to do with the penis. And that is terrible! 

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:29.003
 So this is what we are going to do: we are going to this hospital, we are going 

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:32.004
 to search for a urology specialist. We are going to ask him what the causes of priapism are. 

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:37.005
 And secondly, and more importantly, what the treatment is for priapism. So we go in here. 

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.006
 And I know it's funny, hahaha, Destin talks about a penis, but think about it. 

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:43.007
 If you are a man, you must know this information. 

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.008
 So if I have to take it on me, I'll do that. 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
 I will try not to blush, but if he is a urology specialist, he will 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.010
 either very funny, or very boring. So I do not know. Let's get smarter every day. 

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.011
 Missed door. Dr. Sergey Ananyev? Am I saying that right? 

00:02:57.012 --> 00:03:01.012
 - That's right. - And you're an uh ... let me film this ... a urology specialist? 

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:05.013
 And that's a ... - A laudatory whistle researcher. [laughs] 

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:09.014
 Great, OK so let me see what we do here. What is happening 

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:13.015
 with the erection? - Well, an erection is one 

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:19.016
 side effects of nerves and blood vessels that work together when a man gets excited. 

00:03:19.017 --> 00:03:24.017
 Our penises consist of two rooms with one-way valves. 

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:29.018
 Those two rooms are called corpora cavernosa penis and they communicate together. 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.009
 - They communicate with each other hydraulically? - As in, yes sideways, as in an opening in the wall. 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.000
 - Is it priapism or preeapism (English way of pronunciation). - It's priapism 

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.001
 and a priapism is, by definition, an extended, unwanted erection 

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:45.002
 which usually lasts four hours or longer. 

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:49.003
 - OK, so what does that have to do with a spider in the rainforest? 

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:53.004
 Because that's why I am here. - The spider in the rainforest can, 

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:57.005
 if he gets you, a certain way 

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:01.006
 stimulate and influence, which has an effect on the molecular level 

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:05.007
 nitric oxide. Then you get a nitric oxide emission, which is a molecule. - Exactly. 

00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:09.008
 - It then stimulates another molecule, which takes care of it 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:14.009
 that the muscles in the penis relax. 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 - So the nitric oxide is what activates it, whatever it is ... 

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:22.001
 - That's a step, yes. To finally relax the muscle of the penis 

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:26.002
 that causes blood to flow. - OK, that's a valve? 

00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:30.003
 - Uh, well, nitric oxide is only the molecule that helps to open the door 

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:34.004
 a valve, but indeed. What you actually do is: you have ... they are 

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:38.005
 as it were one-way valves where the flow of blood goes when a man is excited, 

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:42.006
 for any reason. - Yes? - Whether this comes from a partner or a spider. [laughs] 

00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:46.007
 - OK. - Once the blood stream goes in, the valves close and the blood can not go out. 

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:50.008
 - You reminded me of something very strange. So I am an engineer 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.009
 and when I was in school, we had to solve an equation for something that 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.010
 differential equations. And that was about intake and outflow. 

00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.011
 And the speed of inflow against the speed of outflow therefore determined how much 

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:06.012
 fluid was in it ... and then you have the differential equation with which you 

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:13.013
 mathematically can determine the speed in which that does ... what it does. 

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:18.014
 OK there is mathematics in the picture, so I feel more comfortable. The design of the penis is quite interesting. 

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:22.015
 It is like two balloons that are next to each other and you have a supply and an output in the system. 

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:26.006
 If you accelerate these steam speeds, you generate a magnifyingly controlled one 

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:30.007
 volume and that is the erection. Now Dr. Ananyev will install these prosthetic devices 

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:34.008
 in men suffering from erectile dysfunction. This happens by the way of men of all ages. 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.009
 He has decided to demonstrate how this biomechanical system works in the body, just by us 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.010
 to show one of these devices. So this prosthesis that you ... This is what you do, right? 

00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.011
 You put it into the human body, right? - That is one of the many things that we do. 

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:50.012
 - These are the cavernosa, right? - These are the two corpora cavernosa penis. When one 

00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:54.013
 excited, there is an increase in blood flow to both rooms. 

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:58.014
 And I will demonstrate this with the help of this mechanical pump. 

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:02.015
 - So you have a hydraulic pump and you squeeze it. - That's right. 

00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:06.016
 So that pump you there and that takes the liquid from it. 

00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:10.017
 - From the reservoir, which is really your blood stream. 

00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:14.018
 To this organ, what your two corpora cavernosa penis are. 

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.019
 - OK, that's how ... - And then a one-way valve stops it 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.020
 blood of it to flow away. - I get it. So if that is 

00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:27.021
 happens, then ... you know ... 

00:06:27.022 --> 00:06:31.022
 there are sexual activities and then ... - Do you feel a bit uncomfortable Destin? - [laughs] A little yes. 

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:35.023
 You will have to deal with uncomfortable situations all day, will not you? 

00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:39.024
 - That is my defense mechanism yes. - That is amazing. So this is the output? ... 

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:43.005
 Here you have it in the same valve, so how does that happen in the human body? - In the human body, 

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:47.006
 when a man reaches a climax, certain chemicals become 

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:51.007
 released that let the valves open. 

00:06:51.008 --> 00:06:55.008
 What happens in the case of a priapism, Destin, is that you have an elevated 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.009
 blood flow, but instead of reaching a climax 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.010
 and let the valves open and let the blood flow out, 

00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:07.011
 the blood remains for an extended period of time. 

00:07:07.012 --> 00:07:11.012
 Like I said before, about 4 hours or longer. And when that happens, the blood goes into it 

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:15.013
 the corpora cavernosa, as we call it, ischemic. This means that it 

00:07:15.014 --> 00:07:19.014
 oxygen is remembered and if this happens, there will be lumps and 

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:23.015
 it becomes very thick. That in turn makes the problem worse, 

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:27.016
 because it is even more difficult for the thick blood to get out of it, the valves would work at all. 

00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:31.500
 - So what are you doing? - There are a few ways to solve the problem. 

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:35.000
 - Oh yeah? - You can start taking a cold shower. 

00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:39.001
 Let's see if I can get more tape for Mr. Skeleton. 

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:43.002
 - Does it cause permanent damage? If in: can people ... - If you do not get it within 4 hours 

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:47.003
 can reverse, it usually leads to 

00:07:47.004 --> 00:07:51.004
 irreversible scars and a permanent loss of an erection. - Can you die? 

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:55.005
 - Normal ... I do not have, in my limited experience, 

00:07:55.006 --> 00:07:59.006
 to see someone die of priapism, but you can certainly suffer from it. So if the cold shower 

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:03.007
 and the drugs do not work, the next step is to really 

00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:07.008
 the enlarged blood 

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:11.009
 sucking in the penis with a needle. 

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.010
 - With a needle? - Yes that's right. 

00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:19.011
 - So ... You showed me the cavernosa, there is one cavernosum on each side, so you have to 

00:08:19.012 --> 00:08:23.012
 suck individually empty? - No that is not necessary. The cavernosa communicate, so ... 

00:08:23.013 --> 00:08:27.013
 - They have a ... - There is one good thing. Yes, you can normally 

00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:32.004
 they suck empty from one side while the other side 

00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:36.005
 spontaneous ... - Depressed? Is that the term? - Yeah. 

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:40.006
 That is indeed the term. - How big is that needle? 

00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:44.007
 - He's big enough to hurt. You often talk to the patient about stunting 

00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:48.008
 of the area, but then you will have to prick them twice and then they feel fairly uncomfortable. 

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:52.009
 So you need to poke approximately between the corridors 

00:08:52.010 --> 00:09:00.010
 with the needle and put it all the way into their cavernosum and suck something out that the thickness 

00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:04.001
 has tomato paste at that time. - For real? - Or grape jelly. 

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:08.002
 - And ... Oh god. - You will have to do it several times. 

00:09:08.003 --> 00:09:12.003
 Often the blood has become completely lumpy and then you will 

00:09:12.004 --> 00:09:16.004
 remove the lumps and inject sterile salt and rinse 

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:20.005
 to get it out. Once you have rinsed it out, it can come back 

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:24.006
 within 50-10 minutes and then you have to repeat the process. And for the pathetic people 

00:09:24.007 --> 00:09:28.007
 we will have to take more drastic measures to keep the problem back. 

00:09:28.008 --> 00:09:32.008
 - [nervous] Like? 

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:36.009
 - As a step higher in size and instead of a needle, use a scalpel. Mostly 

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.010
 do they need sedation, or a trip to the emergency room? What you have to do then 

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:44.011
 is cutting the penis with the scalpel ... - Seriously? - And the 90 

00:09:44.012 --> 00:09:48.012
 rotate degrees. - Do you ... do you seriously mean this? - Unfortunately yes. 

00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:52.013
 - For real? - Mm hmm. - And then the liquid comes out 

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:56.014
 that open ... [Deep Inhalation] - It will actually create something we call a shunt 

00:09:56.015 --> 00:10:00.015
 of fairly large size. That shunt will 

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:04.006
 making it buddha ... - I'm having trouble breathing now. [laughs] This is bad! - Yes. 

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:08.007
 - So how do you do at that moment ... - That's why I hate spinning. 

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:12.008
 - [laughs] Good grace! Oh man! There is actually nothing else 

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:16.400
 to say, do you? - No. - So really in the jerk? 

00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:20.500
 - That's right - or is that the shine? That's called the shine, right? - Yes, that is indeed the correct name: glans penis. 

00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:24.501
 - Shine? So ... Is it ... Obviously, there is damage. There follows 

00:10:24.502 --> 00:10:28.502
 thereby permanent damage. That is possible, but there will certainly be permanent damage without the treatment. 

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:32.503
 - Finally: how often do you see this problem? Of course not from spider bites, but ... - Well, that depends 

00:10:32.504 --> 00:10:36.504
 the neighborhood you are in, but we probably see it two or three times a year. 

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:40.505
 - So it's pretty rare. - It is fairly rare and yes there is usually 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Identify one using the risk factors, whether it is one 

00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:48.700
 hypersensitive disease, such as sickle cell disease, or overdose of medications 

00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:53.000
 who in the first place already ensure that you come into the 'happy phase'. - Oh, I get it. Well, thank you very much for your time, 

00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:57.001
 I appreciate it very much. Yeah. Best wishes. OK, in summary, I hope you will not find it 

00:10:57.002 --> 00:11:01.002
 that I was too rude, vulgar, or disrespectful at any time. This is a serious problem 

00:11:01.003 --> 00:11:04.403
 and I hope that I have been able to get the information in your brain in an interesting and fun way. 

00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:09.004
 Now that we are serious about it: I still do not work for a salary on Friday, I am on leave. 

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:13.005
 So that's a lot like a father. That is why I am more than happy to tell you about my sponsor.

 There is a book by CS Lewis and also read by CS Lewis in audio, called 

00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:37.011
 The Four Loves. There is one word for love in Dutch. In Greek, there are four. 

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:40.012
 You have eros, agape, filia and storge. 

00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:45.013
 Eros is erotic love, the video, but the other three are very interesting. 

00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:49.014
 Especially stroge; I did not know that. So since I understood the four loves, my way of dealing with is 

00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:53.015
