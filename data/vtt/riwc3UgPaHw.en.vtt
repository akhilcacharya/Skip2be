00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hi I am (Destin). Welcome again at (Smarter Every Day). Something wonderful happened today on the way home 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
 The flower passed in front of the sun. Between us and the sun. 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
 I think so can explain it technically. I had this small imaging machine, and I went to the research center 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.060
 US space and missiles, and there were people from all over the country with binoculars 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.090
 And all types of tools to keep the sun without burning their eyes 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.120
 It was a stunning sight, and I'm sure that if you were following the channel, you knew about it beforehand 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.150
 I did it, so what did you do? 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
 On this video explain it or better show me how I did it so we can collect 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 All these data in one place I will show you what you saw 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
 And then I will show you where the importance of the transmission (eclipse) of Venus in front of the sun 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 You may laugh at this guy with this welding helmet, but he can see the sun better than most people here 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.240
 I think it's a very smart solution. Look at this. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.300
 just awesome. - Learn even if you've collected six 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.350
 Sunglasses on top of each other and tried to look through them, you can not stare at the sun - yes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 - By capturing all those invisible infrared and UV rays that will penetrate the glasses 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.420
 This is great. Have you designed it yourself? Are you a member of the von Braun Space Science Society? 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.450
 - Yes - this is wonderful, man, why do not you look then 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.500
 Through your perspective? 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.550
 - Can I look at any time right? And to whom these people do not have 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 It is good to share - but this is the eclipse of Venus! Certainly 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.650
 The only time you will use your perspective, but let others use it - that's right 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 - This is an amazing right, and it is a way to give back your beauty, your palm. Well I've aligned the surface with 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.750
 The axis through which the sun passes through the sky - in fact 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 You make the surface parallel to the Earth's rotation 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.820
 You make the surface parallel to the Earth's rotation 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.860
 Then you have to run the base bowl 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.930
 In the same longitude as we are 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.000
 The latter rotates in the same axis with the ground - that's great 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.070
 This background with (Saturn 5) makes you look like a space hero 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.180
 For information only. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.100
 Usually you have to monitor three celestial bodies 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.150
 Right? But this time you do it with only two? 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
 In fact only one - this is stunning. What if I leave this here? 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.900
 Just a little backwards 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.920
 Well here she is. 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.230
 Well, I can not see her 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.250
 With this small imaging. there she is. 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
 Well, but you have to follow it manually 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 is not it? But this is easy because of the situation you use correctly? 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.390
 - Yes, there is another situation I can use, but I have to re-try 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
 Each time if someone accidentally moves or kicks the telescope, which may take up to a quarter of an hour of adjustment. 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.450
 But this method does not require much effort. If you notice here there are three 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.450
 Spots on the sun are magnetic storms on the sun. 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.490
 - This is so wonderful, that these people inspire the next generation of space explorers. 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 And of course (NASA) outperform everyone in this trailer, which is offered direct traffic 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.570
 You can also see solar flares on it and like it, you lose it. 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 Reflection of the sun, it spoils the pleasure of viewing, can you see the vision of it? 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.670
 What are you using here? - I use the reflector telescope. 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.730
 - Made it for a project 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.780
 About the romantic period, and specifically about (William Herschel) who developed 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.820
 First Parabolic Viewer, Reflector, Using Curved Mirror - Wait a moment 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.860
 Are you not from the state of Alabama? - Yeah, I'm well - you are not supposed to be, stupid rustic 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.890
 Why do you do this? - Because I'm fond of outer space 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.920
 You love space? That's nice. - In fact, he's already rustic stupid. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.990
 Is it? For information only, I ... 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.060
 -I know that, and I am a common friend of yours. Oh really? - Yes, glad to meet you (Destin), I (Paul) 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.090
 Pleased to meet you (Paul). - This reflector, 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.120
 Uses a f8 lens with a focal length of 48 inches, 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.150
 Made of PVC, carved by myself, 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
 Find the focal length, - for a moment, what was used to sculpt the lens? Toothpaste or something like that? 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.230
 Almost. Used silicon oxide, 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.240
 Cerium oxide, and various things. - Well, I'm going to block your lens for a moment? - please enter. 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.260
 Well the sunlight goes from here to there, I'm blind now Now be frank with me Do you celebrate when, 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.270
 Found Focal Length Finally? Did you raise your fist or something like that? - Yes, I was very happy. 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.290
 I lifted my fist in the air. Awesome, it 's wonderful to meet you. 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.330
 Have you got anything? No, nothing yet. 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.370
 You can use it. - I have found someone there who uses a piece (PVC) 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.410
 I think it's better than you boys. - Yes, we know. - the more likely it is better off. 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 Well, since I was talking about how to monitor the passage of Venus, 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.440
 Who cares? Where is the importance of this? This traffic is very important. 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 So much so that Captain (Cook) in the 18th century 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.510
 He left Britain, went through the Atlantic, and around South America 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.540
 Until he reached a small island called Tahiti. 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.590
 (Tahiti) in particular, because its latitude is different from Britain, and the two signatories are possible 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.640
 Make notes and do some calculations. 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.710
 Unfortunately today we have no data from other latitudes. - You do not have. 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.720
 Who said this? - (Dustin) This is me, (Derek). 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 Hi how are you? Where are you? - At your arms. Here you are 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.770
 (Australia), the world's slowest, how are you (Derek). 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.800
 - That's a big thing, coming from a resident (Alabama). 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.840
 You can mock, what do you have? Why do you wear shaded glasses? 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.860
 - I'm watching the lunar eclipse, is still happening here. 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.880
 I want to talk about the different scenery, and how to use the latitude 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.900
 To determine the distance from the sun. magnificence. 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.920
 Would you please explain to us here? - No, this is a lot on this channel. 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.940
 But the pressure on my face, I'll get you to it. 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.960
 That's really cool. As the days of Captain (Cook), however 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.000
 We do not need to send a person years before we can make a note 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.020
 Because there are already online. - On the chin. 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.040
 Click the face (Derek) and learn more. 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.350
 - On the chin, this is the best part. 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.110
 To do that, follow me. 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.940
 Come on, press! 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.370
 Click here. 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.722
