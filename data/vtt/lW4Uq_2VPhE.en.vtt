00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.063
 Hello! It's me, Desin. Welcome to "Smarter Everyday". 

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:04.778
 I am in the Netherlands today 

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:07.945
 and I'm hanging out with a friend we worked on a scientific project 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.129
 His name is Johan Kr ... 

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.258
 - Cranekin. -That's it. 

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.689
 But in any case, Johann is a laser expert 

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.714
 and we both worked on different things on the Internet. 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.399
 So today we will show you how the lasers work. 

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:22.359
 (music) 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.238
 Desin: So this is a laser with an open tube. 

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:28.452
 Would you explain the components of this type of laser? 

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.477
 Here's the laser tube, 

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:32.791
 filled with a mixture of helium and neon that amplifies the light, 

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:37.277
 and at both ends there are mirrors that are positioned to reflect the vertigo back and forth. 

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:39.678
 "Let's get it on fire?" - Come on! 

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:41.657
 (click) 

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:43.867
 Johann: There is a 4-second delay in safety. 

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.640
 Destin: Okay ... super! 

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:50.618
 Johann: In fact, the helium-neon laser tube is just a more sophisticated version of a neon lamp 

00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:53.250
 It's just ... the electrical charge passes through it 

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:54.846
 as in a neon sign 

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.552
 More particular, it has two holes 

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.851
 through which light can pass. 

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:05.270
 We put two mirrors on both sides of the laser tube 

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.685
 and the light that goes through the laser strikes in the mirror 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.411
 and is reflected back and forth through the pipe. 

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:14.049
 At each pass through the tube the light increases. 

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.149
 If you make this mirror slightly transparent - in this case with 2% transparency - 

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:20.255
 every passing light 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.353
 will come out 2% and there will be a beam coming out of here. 

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:28.795
 So ... then what comes out of the other end of the mirror, 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.067
 is due to the imperfection of the mirror. 

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.237
 With a perfect mirror there would not be a laser beam, would you? 

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:36.958
 --Exactly. "But because the mirrors are imperfect, 

00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:39.638
 a small beam emerges. --Yes. 

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:44.499
 In our case, the laser was designed to reflect only 98% 

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:48.266
 and what we see is the 2nd percentage coming out. 

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.147
 Destin: Okay, I notice that inside the tube 

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:52.694
 the beam is much stronger. 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.003
 You can see how the laser strikes particles in the air. 

00:01:56.028 --> 00:02:00.341
 But down ... the photons that go out of the mirror ... 

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.892
 they are not so strong. Right? -Yes. 

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:07.501
 The light that rotates inside the laser is much more intense. 

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:11.605
 And if you hold your hand off the laser and block the beam, 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.647
 you will notice that you "catch" the beam. It looks very interesting. 

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:17.496
 But if you put your hand inside the pipe 

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.857
 you will prevent the amplification of light 

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:24.883
 and the light will not spin back and forth and the laser will stop working. 

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.373
 Destin: So it stops right at the other end? 

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:30.415
 Although we block the radiation from this country 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.632
 the laser does not shine on the other side. 

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:36.604
 I am personally waiting for the Toronto Toronto (Star Trek). 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.313
 - I've been doing this. "So you got yourself?" Excellent! 

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:41.483
 Anyway, we want to thank Johan for his time 

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:45.175
 and ... uh ... would you thank the people who let us ... in Dutch? 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.449
 Of course! 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.031
 Destin: Do you mock me? 

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:18.322
 Hey! Of course not. (laugh) 

00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:19.872
 Dustin: Do you want to become even smarter? 

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.082
 Then watch this video from MinutePhysics. 

00:03:22.107 --> 00:03:25.013
 Henry explains what is happening inside the helium-neon tube 

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.454
 in this cool science video. 

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:30.513
 (music) 

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.767
 Desin: I present to you the months of lasers. 

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:37.087
 The Laser Month will have many videos we shot here in the Netherlands with Johannes. 

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.925
 He is a true laser genius. Can I call you a laser genius? 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.466
 --Of course! (Dustin laughs.) 

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.193
 All right. Now we'll play a laser limb. Ready? 

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:46.761
 --No. --Why not? 

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:49.388
 --It's dangerous! - Come on, laser limb!
