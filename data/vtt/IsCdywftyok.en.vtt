 Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 It will probably surprise you to hear that we had hockey on the 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
 university where I went. Anyway today we are going to talk about the physics of a slap shot. 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.100
 You become smarter every day. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.190
 No, dude, do you miss a tooth? 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 That is so typical for a hockey player. Can I see it? 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.270
 What did you do when your tooth was knocked out? 3 years ago. 3 what? 3 and a half years ago. 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.290
 That's great guy. Is that a kind of access ritual that you have to lose a tooth 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.290
 to play hockey? No, I mean ... ah ... 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.340
 Only the good player? Only the good players. Okay, so this is what we're going to do today. We're going to hit the puck 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.370
 and take that up with the Phantom that I have there, and then we look 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.400
 exactly what happens. I've heard that you do not hit the puck first, but me 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.490
 wants to see the dynamics of what happens. But first, let's take a look at the stick here. What kind of stick 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 is it, is it a wooden stick? No, it is one piece of composite. Yeah 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.540
 made from graphite.
