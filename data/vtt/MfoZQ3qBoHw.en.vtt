Hey it's me, Destin. Welcome
to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:10.517
So a few years ago I messed up

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:12.646
and put a video of me playing
with my chicken on the Internet,

00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:14.990
and now everybody says "Hey,
aren't you the chicken man?"

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.573
...his head stays rock
solid in one position.

00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:22.371
And I'm cool with being the chicken man,

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:24.656
but I think there's a lot
cooler things I can be,

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:28.183
like, uh... I don't know. Let's
play with fire, what about that?

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.818
So today we're gonna learn about vorticity.

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:33.994
Vorticity is the circulation
in a confined area defi--

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.886
divided by that area.

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.835
So today we've made a fire tornado.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.936
I guess I should put safety glasses
on to make this official science.

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:45.167
We've made a fire tornado
by restricting the airflow

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:47.383
to the flame, except
through a certain area.

00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:50.016
Now, when I turn the vorticity up

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:52.542
by increasing circulation
with this vacuum cleaner,

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:53.748
we're going to start a chain of events.

00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:57.173
The fire tornado will set
off a trigger on the rifle,

00:00:57.198 --> 00:01:01.287
and the rifle will fire and
light these matches over here.

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:04.459
Once it lights the matches, the
gunpowder will go up and light a rocket,

00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:06.610
and well, uh... you'll see the rest.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.256
So let's check it out.

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:15.968
[Periodic crackling]

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:29.859
That's a pretty good way
to light a bonfire.

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:34.577
So anyway, I was thinking about maybe
another name instead of chicken man.

00:02:34.602 --> 00:02:37.734
How about pyrodynamicist?

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.399
What do you think about that?
[Chicken clucking]

00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:44.274
What do you think about that, Claire?
Cool with that?

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.550
[Loud sizzling]

00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:55.043
Anyway, you're getting smarter every day.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.367
Have a good one.
