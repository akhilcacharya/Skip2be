 Hi, this is me (Dustin) Welcome back in the smartest every day. So I'm in central California 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
 The desert and the sun are sinking this beautiful, I will let you see it 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
 You see, while this video is prepared for you, someone calls Jeff 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.040
 Is the (taofledermaus) on YouTube which is a German word meaning and tattoos 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.070
 A mammal. Anyway, he asked me if I wanted to participate in international cooperation 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.080
 For high-speed video in efforts to upgrade a lot of small channels 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.110
 Which taught things by high-speed cameras 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.110
 So I will definitely do so. Well what a common theme 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 In the destruction of snacks, because we all can get a light meal and we all love 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.140
 Destroying things was easy. My thinking went to me 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.140
 Great I can only enjoy the high-speed camera and not worry about learning or learning anything 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.170
 But I was wrong I learned something. That's what I'm going to do 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
 I will show you the video that I and Tiffur Garry prepared 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.210
 Try to destroy snacks and also I have learned something 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.220
 So I hope you will learn with me. I'll see you just watch this 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.230
 If he grew up in the South you would know what Zacko is 33 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.260
 Well, Donut .. High Speed ​​Camera 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 Oooo flavored desserts 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.310
 And arc 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 I'll make it settle down completely 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.370
 By the way we have another camera here 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.400
 On the bow. (Tifor) ready for divorce 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 We have decided that we will act on the Donuts side 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 Tevor will stop eating donuts 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.260
 Mountain Dew 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.570
 Here is a duo in your eyes 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660
 It was like a helicopter 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.730
 What do you think we should call this video? (Tevor) Well this will be Mountain Spoil 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.820
 gunshot 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.850
 A slow shot 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.910
 Do not worry I do not waste food 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.520
 A little lead in it I think 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.940
 Well now the part from which I learned something 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.960
 Before I fired from a pistol on my 22 donuts 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.970
 This fly started buzzing around the donuts and decided that it would be nice if you were patient 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.980
 So that it is at the right depth in the field and will launch and launch the wave of explosion 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.020
 Wari's wings spread through his wings 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.050
 It is well cohesive. Well what he did was that an explosion wave came through his wings 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.080
 He has bent himself a little bit but instead of compensation 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.110
 He stopped and waited while he waited 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.140
 It allows the center of its gravity to overcome the current of air on the pressure center 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160
 Then move to the side a bit then just do it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170
 Restores control and then starts 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.180
 All this happens in a moment, it was wonderful and it was amazing 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.220
 In any case, they saw the shot and after you saw the shot I put a link 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.220
 For the playlist for high-speed shared video you can see 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.230
 Great things, I do not know how to use a knifel with one hand 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.250
 Anyway, enjoy the video. I learned something
