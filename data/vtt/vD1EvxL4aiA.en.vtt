00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hey, I'm in Destin. Welcome to Smarter every Day. So today we are 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
 preparing for the Iron Bowl. We are at Jordan-Hare Stadium before people come 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
 And we will practice with the Axes. Each party 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 of Auburn the eagle flies around and touches the field and everyone calls "Eagle Fight", a scene 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.040
 really awesome, but I'm a fan of Alabama. But it is the same, we will make equipment together 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.090
 in this academic affair to see what we can learn. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.130
 [music] 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310
 Okay, we're here in the field 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.320
 Jordan-Hare Stadium with Marianne Hudson, and she is in charge 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.340
 of the Spirit and the New, and is about to teach us what he does before the game 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 and during the match. - Correct, we practice with these birds practically every day 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390
 here at the stadium. Many people do not realize that we spend a lot of time at Jordan-Hare Stadium, 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.400
 so birds are used to eating them here. This is where they spend breakfast 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.420
 virtually every morning. So one day of party we bring the birds here out, 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 The only difference is that there are 87,000 people looking at us, though 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.450
 For birds it is nothing more than routine. (Destin) OK, then for the Iron Bowl this is the dinner plate? 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460
 - Correct. What the bird knows is that every time he touches this bait they give him food. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.470
 On the other side, he says the date and the competitors, 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 and when the bird touches this bait, he gets some food. 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 (Destin) So where do we put it? You put it out there and ... just drag it on? - Correct. What we do is: 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.550
 The bird looks for us, and knows that between me and my colleague Roy 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.590
 One will have this in his hands, and when he plays he will have prize food, so 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.620
 He is looking for us, and he is waiting for this to happen, and we often try to let him fall 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.350
 about 50, because that is our tradition. 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.730
 [music] 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.320
 Okay, one question I've always had is 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.330
 What happens if the eagle suddenly decides to leave the stadium? I mean, could it happen, right? They are 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.370
 Animals often go to yours. Well, people here at Alburn University 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.400
 they have thought What do we have here, then? - Every time we fly any of ours 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.420
 Birds, be it the smallest owl or the bigger eagle, we put them 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 a telemetry unit. It is a tracking device. We have a receiver 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.480
 that reads the signal of the transmitter when it is on. (Destin) What's in here? 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.510
 (Destin) Is that so eh? - And we have a piece to attach the stuck transmitter 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.520
 always in the tail of the eagle. (Man) There is the mount of the tail. 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.540
 Small clips ... there. 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.570
 Insured, it is safe to fly. (Destiny) And does the bird realize that the transmitter has the device? 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 Nop. It is very light. He does not know he's there. It does not interfere 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.610
 In case I try to escape, I would not get tangled anywhere. 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.630
 (Destin) In fact, it is also on the rebound, so in this position it does not drag it too aerodynamically. 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.680
 Correct, so it combines well with everything else, with its general aerodynamic shape 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.695
 and it does not hinder it at all. 

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:01.710
 So now you know how to trace your home eagle. 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.730
 Okay, I'm here with Clay. We are at Jordan-Hare Stadium before the game. You can 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.760
 See how they paint the lines for the Iron Bowl. Look 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.790
 They are not the only ones to prepare for the Iron Bowl. Aah, the bird ... 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.810
 The eagle has blurred me. 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.850
 He has blurred me several times because I'm going 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.850
 Crimson and he does not like it. Roda Marea. (shout of Alabama) 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.860
 - Eagle Fight. Whatever. 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.870
 I really believe that if you ask me, legitimately 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.880
 The tiger is our pet, but now obviously 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.890
 We have the golden eagle, which you know 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.910
 brings our team to victory, it's our shout. (Destin) I will be sincere with you, 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.930
 It does not make sense for me to go around the world with an eagle with a tiger above it. 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.016
 It does not make sense, nano. 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.970
 It's aaah, it worked all season last [laughter] 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.570
 American Pigarg below the legs. 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.050
 We tried to investigate how to get an elephant to fly over the stadium before the games, but we could not get 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.090
 the reactors ... throw operation in dumbo yes ... 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.110
 We did not get that in Bear Byant to find out for us. 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.140
 Does my hijop finish blowing? 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
 Yes, you've come to talk about Alabama ... in your stadium. 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.170
 I wear crimson clothes. 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.180
