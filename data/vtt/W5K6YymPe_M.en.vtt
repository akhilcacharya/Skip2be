00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.010
 Hi, it's me Destin. This week, Smarter Every Day teaches you something 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 with a gun and a high-speed camera. Do you remember the old video with the gun underwater? 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.050
 This week I will repeat this with a better camera and bigger weapons. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.230
 Okay, we have my father's AK-47 here. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.310
 Fine, the gun is not charged. 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.340
 There is a small stop on the back of this thing, 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.400
 to which the stock will click. So everything I did 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.430
 is that I created a metal counterpart. We have it on this side 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.470
 and on the other hand it is fastened with a J-bolt 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.510
 as you can see, clicked 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 and here, attached to the J-bolt. 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.560
 If you do not know the AK-47, it's very easy. Just remove the top cover 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.580
 remove the spring and then remove the breech carrier 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.610
 When you pull out the breech, you can see this big piston. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.670
 Thanks to this piston, the whole mechanism that charges another charge works and it is quite simple how these things work. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
 When a bullet moves through the barrel passes an opening, 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 which allows the gases to enter the cylinder 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.730
 in which the piston moves rearwards, which moves the breech block, 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.770
 he charges another charge from the stack. So I ask: when the gas goes into 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.800
 cylinder and begins to push the piston, 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.830
 what will happen to that whole water? I think it will slow down the shutter, 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.870
 but we'll use a high-speed camera to find out if I'm right. 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 Here we have a small cap that I painted white so we can figure out the speed. 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.910
 First shot: air. As you can see, 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.920
 we shoot right into the embankment. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.930
 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.100
 So, time for water. 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.290
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.360
 That's a lot more water than last. 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.650
 Let's try if it still works. We'll find out if I owe another father a gun. 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.680
 It's still working. So what is the answer? 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.710
 Does the buoy move faster in the wind or when the whole gun is underwater? 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 Before I show you the answer, I must apologize to you. When you look at the video 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.740
 Underwater gun, you will see that only the back of the aquarium has broken apart, 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 but the walls remained intact. But now I used hardened glass instead of normal. 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.800
 If you break a corner on a hardened glass, the whole board will break apart. 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.810
 So, of course, I ruined the experiment, I'm sorry. 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.840
 Check out the difference between air and water: 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.930
 I have two theories why water is faster. 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.940
 When you think about it, you have a large column of water in front of the chamber. 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.980
 So you have to accelerate all the matter instead of just the bullet itself. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.020
 It makes sense, because if you look, you will see a broken fuse. 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.050
 This shows us the high pressure in the chamber. That is, the piston 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.060
 pushes more force. Water is also incompressible, while air is compressible. 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.110
 As a result, the pressure gets to the piston faster. 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.130
 I hope you liked it. My goal was to create not just something to learn, but something to enjoy 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.140
 and for what I deserve your subscription. But I messed up with the aquarium, so that 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.190
 maybe I deserve in the second part. If you want to see it click me. 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.220
 And do not try it at home. I have a little more experience than you think. 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.260
 I'm Destin. You're smarter every day. Have a nice day. 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.340
 I think now is a good time to discuss the terms of our agreement. 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.370
 You'll replace my weapon if you do damage it anyway. 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.370
 Wait, it does not sound like a discussion. It sounds like an order. 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.420
 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.430
 It is a non-functioning charge. 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.530
 The sail was a bad idea. A little in the wrong place. 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.560
 Tilt to capture all glass. It's much more fun if you pretend to be an elephant 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.580
 and collecting nuts. You may notice a bubble, 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.610
 which came out through these openings. We will talk about this in the second part.
