00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.010
 Hello. Me, Dustin. Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day" Did you know that Harry Haudini was 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.070
 The first person to fly a plane to Australia? So I did not know that. Something crazy! 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.170
 Actually. The life of this man was interesting because he lived an elusive death 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.220
 In front of thousands of people. Now all this is known. What's in your ear? 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.260
 Oh. There is a stone in your permission. Charm! 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.310
 If this is appropriate, Harry Houdini was a Jew. These are usually Jews 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.370
 If you want to respect the dead, go and lay a stone on the stone of the mausoleum. Why do we do that? 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.430
 Let's see Queens New York, there are beautiful stone tombs and a beautiful stone setting 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.450
 There I will explain to you how Houdini died. 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.490
 Haudini was smart. He became famous for putting himself in difficult and intolerable situations. 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 And then he will miraculously appear as if he has come out of the pursuit of death 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.610
 So what did he put here in New York? Since most people are afraid of drowning 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.670
 Haudini was working his trick that included people tied chains in water. Months 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.740
 His trick is the trick of "Chinese watery agony". For some reason I thought it had sank 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 When the trick turned wrong. But it really was just a punch in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.810
 His belly drowned him. Houdini was famous for his ability to take punches but at 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 22 - 10 - 1926 when he was sitting on the couch behind the scenes in 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.870
 Monnerr. A man punches several times before he has any chance to defend himself 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 According to the testimony of his death. Harry died in Halloween because of something called "peritonitis" 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.900
 So how to stomach stomach is accounted for in the death of Haundi? Although he has passed several punches previously? 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.980
 OK. We returned to the "Alabama". To find out what happened. We went to the hospital 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.030
 We'll meet the surgeon I've known for a long time. He is known for his steady hand 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.060
 And with his words. Let's go see Dr. Gilbert. It's been a long time 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.140
 how are you? Hi, It's been a long time. Your weight seems to have increased 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.210
 Thanks I appreciate it. Its shape makes you feel secure. Oh, clear 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.250
 I've known Dr. Gilbert for a long time. He made me enter to run his operations. If I asked you 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.270
 To tell me about the death of Haudini. We know ... how do you say it? 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.320
 "Sputum". OK. If to move he took a punch in his stomach 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.380
 Haudini was lying on the table now. What will you do? 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.440
 OK. Houdini. As far as this table. It will be 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.490
 Approved the surgery. The first thing you should do is make it ... 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.540
 We need to examine it. Let's say you have sputum. you need 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.600
 To take the rays of your belly. You will definitely have surgical problems 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.620
 It could have appendicitis, but appendicitis usually does not occur because 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 Shock. It could have been a delightful occasion 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
 After the shock. What has been very well done 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.720
 His intestines rupture. - So when you take a punch in your courage, what happens 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.770
 There? I know muscles have something to do about it. - If you are ready you are tense 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.840
 The muscles are almost all absorbed by energy
