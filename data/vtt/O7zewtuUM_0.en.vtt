00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280
 Hey, I am in Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.560
 In one of the last episodes I presented a legend with the bow. 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.220
 It's from my native land and its name is Byron Ferguson. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.620
 He shot an aspirin in the air in a slow chamber. 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 But there is one thing that happened that I did not understand. 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.360
 It was curving and it has to do with what is called the "archer's paradox." 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.580
 What do you think, Byron? 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.140
 - "The paradox of the archer is a demon for all the archers, 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
 but there are ways to avoid it. " 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.500
 Nothing bad 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.060
 Well, then I went to Smarter Every Day, 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 understand me how to curve an arrow 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700
 and what is called the "paradox of the archer". 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.900
 A paradox is a situation concerning two things with a contradictory nature. 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 Well, what is the archer's paradox? 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.460
 What are the two things that the archer must fix? 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 My friend John told me this way. 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
 Suppose this walnut is the bow 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.220
 and that this is the line of the arc rope. 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 If we take an arrow and place it on our arch and stretch it, 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 and if we are trying to give that goal there, 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.960
 See what happens. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 As we release the rope and it approaches the bow 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.480
 -and hear this. 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.460
 the fact that the arch is halfway between us and the goal, 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.640
 causes the arrow to deviate is a different direction. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.960
 So how can we achieve that goal, when our girlfriend is pointing there? 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.720
 This is the paradox of the archer, because we know that they really fit goals like this. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.560
 Toy designers are cheaters: they do not face the paradox, they simply avoid it. 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.920
 For example, the person who designed this suction cup arch, 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 It does not pass by the handle, 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.940
 directly through the middle. 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.700
 See this! 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.900
 The person outside that designed this arc, instead of aligning itself with the own arch, 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.920
 the rope is compensated for this great rail. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.300
 In this way, the rope is always pushing towards the dart. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 So how does an archer handle to solve this problem? 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 That's how: they do not use a completely rigid arrow like that, 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 they have a flexible arrow like this one. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020
 Do you see when it vibrates? Do you see these nodes? 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.260
 This is important. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.680
 Look at that As we put this arrow in the bow and shoot, 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.000
 As we move towards the bow, the fact of being accelerating the arrow 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.720
 It causes generating voltage energy, causing this great curvature. 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.260
 This curvature then returns to the other direction once it has bent to a certain point 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.500
 and see what we have. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.720
 We need that the arrow is curving around the bow. 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
 When we let loose, something interesting happens. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.980
 Snake around the bow, this way 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.460
 and you are able to fly all the way to the goal. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.520
 Then the paradox of the archer is the fact that you have an arc between you and the goal 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.880
 and yet you are able to surround the bow. 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.340
 "The first thing that happens is that the arrow is bent by the pressure of the rope 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 and the front of the arrow is on the opposite side of the arch platform. 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
 As you move away from the bow, or you have left it behind, 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740
 bends in the opposite direction. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.420
 Wherever these two are crossed, it determines where the arrow will fly. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.360
 One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points cross, where they point. 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.280
 So if one had been here, then the arrow would fly to the left. 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 If I had been here, I would fly to the right. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.160
 We want these two to be directly aligned towards the goal. " 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.720
 - "I understand. Then the fact that it bends helps to skirt the rest of the arrow 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.520
 without losing the angle, as if it were a straight line. " 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 - "Correct." 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.220
 - "You are pushing the rope directly to the handle, but somehow it happens around the handle. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.200
 - "Exact." 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.380
 - "Yes, and is it with the curvature with what he does?" 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.060
 - "Exactly." 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
 Very well, my colleague Sander shoots with a compound arc. 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.440
 Do you do anything with a long bow, right? 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440
 - "I have one, but I do not get very well." 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.320
 - "Well, what's the challenge here?" 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.460
 - "In a compound, there are many more things in progress, in a compound. 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.460
 There are more things that can go wrong, too, 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.460
 but there are some advantages if they work. " 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.980
 -"If." 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 - "In a compound, you see that it is cut through the middle, you have it" 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
 - "Oh, the platform is not fixed, is this what you say?" 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.640
 - "Yes, then the arrow travels straight, it does not have to surround the platform." 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.140
 -"OK." 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860
 - "And many people shoot with a swing platform, so it will fall. 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.200
 When I stretch out the arch, a cord tied to one of the strings of the arch raises it " 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.720
 - "Fantastic!" 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.020
 "- focus the arrow, and if you have it aligned and square, 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.720
 your arrow is good and leveled, then, when you shoot, that arrow falls ... the rest will fall " 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820
 - "Well, shoot, shoot. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let's zoom". 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.860
 - "Hang on, I'm looking at the platform, it will fall, right? 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.640
 -"Very fast!" 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.220
 - "OK, I'm ready. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.320
 Uncle, that is very quick. 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.720
 So the arrow is touching the platform when it happens? " 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.980
 -"A little." -"For real?" 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.500
 - "Because it falls, but no, I mean, immediately, it's down when the arrow passes." 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.200
 - "Then the goal is, you do not have to bend around the platform, 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200
 but still the arrow doubles, right? 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.900
 - "Yes, it bends, and that is important for the straightness of the flight of the arrow." 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.980
 Is not that interesting? But there's something else here. 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.600
 Byron Ferguson is able to predict the oscillation of the arrow so well, 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.440
 That is able to give an aspirin with a vibrant arrow, this way. 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.500
 It's going through one of two. a) he knows some science that we do not; 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.540
 ob) is a wizard and all that is black magic. 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 - "Very well, the rigidity of an arrow is what feeds your spine, right? 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120
 And what's the thorn, Byron? " 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.620
 - "The rigidity of an arrow." 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.840
 - "Oh, sure! 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.140
 Then is this your spine meter? " 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.860
 - "This is the spine meter, now prepared to measure the flexion of a carbon arrow." 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.640
 -"OK." 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.060
 - "Well, we have a free two-wire weight and an arrow with 26 inches." 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.780
 -"OK." 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 - "And we read within the scale here, to see how much it bends." 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.220
 - "So, do you test all your arrows before firing, in order to normalize the paradox?" 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.940
 - "Exactly, I want all the arrows to have the same rigidity." 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.360
 - "And that's how you're able to get things right like an aspirin?" 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.780
 - "It's a part, yes." 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.480
 - "There is a small part of skill. 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.660
 If it's out of tolerance, do not you even put it in your room? " 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.240
 - "That's all those." 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.060
 - "Really? Really? Do you have a box of things that you do not shoot?" 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.920
 - "Yes, they are too far from tolerable." 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.420
 - "Really? It's fantastic. People asked the last video - that arrow was bending too much - 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.840
 they said, "how do you measure this?" and how you measure this is that you know the exact spine of the arrow. " 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.340
 - "Exactly." 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.280
 - "It's fabulous. It's very good information. So that's not magic, is it science?" 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.820
 -"Of couse." 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.320
 - "It's fabulous." 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.500
 Byron uses science to normalize the oscillation of his arrows. 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.740
 But leaving it aside, here's a bit of witchcraft, right? 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.840
 Because at a certain distance from your bow, 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.720
 you still have to know the band of the bow so it will oscillate. 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.740
 And then you have to align it with an aspirin. 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.480
 This is a very good shot. 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.620
 To fully appreciate this complicated feature, I will make a complicated shot of myself, using my Phantom Miro. 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.300
 I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it has been sponsored by Harrys.com.

 Harry's makes shavings to be subscribed, they are of very good quality. 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.160
 I went for the same price as the old leaves I used to use. 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.440
 I no longer need my old leaves, so in Byron it will help me get rid of them.

 - "Will you take it there?" 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.100
 - "I will cut my head."

 - "Perfect. 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.640
