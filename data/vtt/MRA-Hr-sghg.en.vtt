00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.221
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:02.407
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:03.942
Every December it's a tradition for me to make

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:05.396
a video down here in Peru

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:07.146
about an orphanage project I've been working on.

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.824
Specifically it's with Not Forgotten

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:10.511
and I make the video every December

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.291
because I want people to vote for Not Forgotten

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:13.675
on the Project for Awesome website.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.980
This year I'm not just gonna update you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.886
on the orphanage.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:18.894
Apparently there's an Amazonian river monster

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.037
project that I've been a part of

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:21.144
that I didn't know about.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:22.866
So today let's go check out the orphanage

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.789
then I'll tell you about river monsters.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.765
Let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:26.768
If you're new to this project

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:28.454
just know that for several years some friends of mine

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:29.786
have been working to build an orphanage

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:32.042
in Iquitos Peru because it has one of the highest

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.702
rates of abandonment in the world.

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:36.230
With your support, last year we completed the first phase.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.135
Check this out.

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:39.169
There's one major difference this year from last year.

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:41.446
Look closely, you'll see it.

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:43.351
There's kids..

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.519
all over the place. [laugh]

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:47.952
We have an operational orphanage in Peru.

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:48.792
It's a big deal.

00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:50.830
Cause these guys are not on the streets.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.200
The system in Iquitos is so saturated

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.098
with abandoned children,

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:55.136
specifically boys,

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.661
that as soon as the paperwork and licensing

00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.076
to setup the homes was complete,

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.291
over a dozen boys were immediately accepted.

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:02.004
These kids are hilarious.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.567
And for some reason they really love making zombie faces.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.767
Traditional orphanages work like this.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.353
You get somone to build a really big building

00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:09.582
that can house a bunch of kids

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:10.756
and then you hire a couple of workers

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:13.189
to run the place and provide for the physical needs of the children.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.666
Not Forgotten is different.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.384
The focus of the entire structure

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:17.721
is a father and a mother.

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.979
As boys enter the home they become brothers

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.012
and the entire house becomes a family.

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:26.266
The boys are given stability by consistent love from parents.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.292
Let's meet the families.

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:28.796
Meet Merry and Moises.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.019
[spanish]

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:35.752
(Destin) Many families interviewed for the position of house parents

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:37.663
and these were among the first selected.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:38.922
They're super patient,

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:39.770
they laugh a lot

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.094
and in just the short amount of time

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:42.615
I spent with them I could tell they're doing this

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:44.661
for all the right reasons.

00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:46.734
One of the coolest things to me

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.386
is that they have dinners with family,

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:49.455
like a family unit.

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.181
So we're disturbing dinner.

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:56.687
This is dinner time at Moises' house.

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:58.180
[spanish]

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.262
OK one of the host parents, Isaac is a music teacher

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:27.809
and he's about to play for us.

00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:32.307
[music]

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:25.272
[applause]

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:27.985
Alright, check this out.

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:29.736
Somebody saw the video last year

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.521
and sent in an anonymous donation

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:34.095
to give the kids transportation

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.960
to and from school.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:37.598
So they use the van to bring the kids here

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:38.867
to school. It's a public school

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:40.174
but it's privately funded,

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.782
which means it has really cool stuff

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:42.777
like a library,

00:03:42.777 --> 00:03:44.110
a computer classroom,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.083
there's a wood shop,

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.773
there's also a place to learn about cooking.

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:48.453
We factored in the cost of a psychologist

00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:50.031
to periodically visit the boys to make sure

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:52.184
all their emotional needs are being met.

00:03:52.184 --> 00:03:54.579
Also if the boys are having trouble with any subject at school

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.013
they get special tutoring from a private professor

00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:59.531
that comes to the home to make sure they don't fall behind.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:00.824
Education is key,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.061
and for me this is one of the most important parts.

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.760
Just listen to how excited these boys are to be learning

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.736
English from Isaac's wife, Ruth, their mother.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.425
[excited interactions]

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.801
So one of the cool things about this place

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.523
is that these guys have their own rooms.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:22.841
And they're very proud of them.

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.592
So we're gonna get a little tour of the room.

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:25.484
Can you show me?

00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:28.376
This is Jack,

00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:29.856
he's gonna tell us about his space.

00:04:32.226 --> 00:04:33.343
[spanish]

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:35.184
It's your bed.

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.206
[spanish]

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.621
Yeah, your closet.

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:42.198
[spanish]

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:44.025
Your drawers. Yeah.

00:04:49.837 --> 00:04:50.640
Closet

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.094
Closet?

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.857
[spanish]

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.930
Escritorio, Si. Bueno.

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:01.285
[laughs]

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.958
He tried it in English and said it was his closet.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.932
Perfecto.

00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:10.590
So Rodbin is trying to catch the river monster.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.304
So he's got a hook here.

00:05:13.274 --> 00:05:14.935
This is for the fish?

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:17.458
If you visit the meat market at Iquitos

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:18.432
you'll see pig heads,

00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:19.180
alligator tails,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.545
and even turtles which I didn't see coming.

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:24.459
One of the most common foods is called the arapaima.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:26.730
It's one of the largest fresh water fish in the world.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.311
Three years ago the local director of Not Forgotten, Jean,

00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:31.314
released six of these things into the pond

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:34.464
in hopes of some day using them to feed children at the property.

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:36.822
I've heard the locals call these things paiche

00:05:36.822 --> 00:05:39.119
but I've never actually seen one.

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:40.809
So it looks like Rodbin has caught a paiche.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.527
Let's go check it out.

00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:44.798
You serious?

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:46.734
Look at that thing.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:48.137
That thing is huge!

00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:51.670
OK we've found the river monster.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.855
This is a paiche.

00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:53.544
They're gigantic.

00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:55.058
Look at that.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.624
Holy cow.

00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:10.740
I'm going in with the river monster.

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:14.456
I'm gonna pick it up.

00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:26.740
Holy cow.

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.466
Oh my gosh.

00:06:37.173 --> 00:06:38.699
You're gonna get this picture right?

00:06:41.574 --> 00:06:43.246
It's like a dinosaur. Here we go.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.705
OK, I don't wanna hurt him.

00:06:52.548 --> 00:06:54.699
Look at the slime.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.576
Pick it up one more time?

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:04.577
You're gonna get a good pic?

00:07:07.757 --> 00:07:12.464
Alright, so people think that we've been working on an orphanage down here.

00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:16.682
We're actually raising huge river monsters.

00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:19.591
You want to touch it?

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:22.119
Look at the kids.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.376
Yeah you touch it?

00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:36.559
Alright let's get him back in.

00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:39.024

and give them a stable environment to grow up in.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.549

[spanish]

00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:33.961
Alright. No paiche were harmed in the..

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.292
Oh wait, we're eating it!

00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:37.489
[laughs]
