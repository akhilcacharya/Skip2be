00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.080
 Hello My name is Dustin Welcome back at: "Smarter Every Day" 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
 I pass the road to Atlanta Georgia. You can see the dome behind me 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.190
 I am at the University of Atlanta Georgia and have a box of butterflies wings. 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.230
 We will try to solve the mystery we encountered in the forest. We discovered it when we dropped it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 A butterfly begins to fly, there are atoms of dust flying from its wings 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320
 At least that's what I call. Watch this: 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.980
 "What is this dust?" 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.580
 In order to know what that is, I came to the "Betit" science center here at the University of Georgia, 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 Are we going to the Center for Biological Imaging - Dr. Simmons? glad to meet you. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.650
 -glad to meet you. - I brought some butterflies - ah, excellent 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 Destin: Aoh .. Here's where you work? - I live here - let us do it. 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.710
 -please enter. If you see the last shot you realize that these particles of dust are already 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.740
 Come from the wings of the butterfly. The thing that we do not know anyway is how 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.790
 These particles were originally installed. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.830
 It has happened that Dr. Simmons is a microscopic expert who has just given us a small lesson on electronic scanning microscopes. 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 If Dr. Simmons drew all this I would try 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.890
 He should be guided. Correct me if I make a mistake. -OK. 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.930
 - We have an electronic gun at the top here, we start sending a stream of electrons here. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.980
 When approaching here pass through what I call electromagnetic lenses? - Yeah 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 Well, we change the beam, and we scan that ray on 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.020
 Which was here, in our case a butterfly wing. - Butterfly wing 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 Depending on the location of the survey, we measure the feedback electrons from the sample. 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 Using what is called an "electron amplifier"! 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.130
 - It is a kind of electron detectors. - Then pass through some filters. Later we will be able to get 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.160
 On a gray gradient. Principally is this true? - Basically it is - 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.980
 - We are now experts in electron microscopy scanner can we say that? 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.250
 - Yes - [Laughing] Well the time of science glasses on the eyes .. I think this is the nicest glasses I have been given 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.260
 I will not lie to you. Well here question we have three types of butterflies wings here, 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.290
 Our "sunset moth" is theoretically not a butterfly, we have "Morpho" 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.310
 Our "Cithearius" what we will do is that Dr. Symens 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.400
 He will use the electronic microscope to show us the difference between these wings 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.420
 Now, the thing that I think is interesting in regards to the "Cithaerius" is that it ranks between 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.470
 The wings are exposed and transparent wings. 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 - The unfortunate thing is that this test is destructive. - destructive destructive. We will. 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.690
 In the electronic microscope we will rain it with a barrage of electrons to get this difference 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.740
 Massive in shipments. But the problem is that the wings of the butterflies are a buffer 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
 Is Dr. Simsons saying that correctly? - Well, well, we'll unload that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.800
 Voltage, or .. think voltage difference. We'll empty it back to the ground. 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.820
 The way we do this is by putting gold around that wing to have a way to the ground. 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.880
 Start the countdown to the experiment. -Well 3 .. 2 .. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
 1 .. You will press the start button - beautiful. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
 This is a cloud of gold? - There are atoms of gold 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.960
 Platinium flies in the vicinity of the insulator. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.020
 - Looks a little different. - Yes look different I acquired a relatively thick layer on them 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.040
 Our here went. - 60% gold and 40% Platinum 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.080
 OK. Here we started, all this took years of experience with the decoration of Simons 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.120
 In biology, physics and optics do this. 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.300
 Note that, as you can see, these two "squares" close to each other have different fascia. 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 Small holes on the right with a diameter of one micron 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.350
 right Now. I once heard that the wings of butterflies are colored by the holes on them so you will think that the ones on the right are colored 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.400
 Right? Well, I made a simple comparison, and I noticed that the nets have a structure 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.420
 Actually black! Since the electron microscope uses electrons instead 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 Light, it can not provide color images, so it is common for scientists to manufacture fake color images 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 To help people understand what they are looking at. See her again, but this time with fake colors. 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.520
 Well, let's look at the "Morpho" as you can see that the front face of the wing is blue but somewhat backward 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.540
 If you wipe it, we'll see that these brown sheets have small holes 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 But the blue party seems to have some grooves, if measured by the width of those grooves 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.600
 We'll notice it's completely long-wave yellow color. 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.660
 White Light - Yellow = Light Blue 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.700
 So somehow those grooves delete the yellow light to make those wings look blue. And if that wing is taken 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.740
 And cut it here, and looked at those grooves, as if you were looking at a valley. 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.750
 You'll see a puzzling microscopic structure, that's amazing. When it falls 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.760
 White light, this microstructure is the ideal measurement of interaction with 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.780
 The wavelength of the light is visible and the color is deleted yellow, which is what keeps the color blue 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.810
 This gives the Morpho its color. In this "goliath birdwing" butterfly 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.890
 This complex microscopic structure deletes red and blue discoloration 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.960
 Green, after thinking about it, realized that somehow I filled those gaps 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.010
 It will not be able to interact with the light, and I should be able to see the painted wing as it is 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.020
 Instead of chromatic deception. Here we begin, when the wings are covered 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.070
 With a little Isopropanol you can see that the wing has lost its beam due to the filling of that microstructure. 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.110
 But after that matter evaporates, those bright colors come back, and here you are again. 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.160
 Butterflies use microstructure to falsify their color damage 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.170
 But we did not answer our question how those "bedspreads" installed on the wings? 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.230
 Like this: as if someone had carefully planted trees 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.290
 With equal distances. I think it's beautiful during flying 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.310
 Or even the dynamics of the air along the wing, in a way that pulls those scales out of their roots 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
 Leaving these holographic effects. So each time you touch the wings of this butterfly you do 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.380
 Remember that "cethaerius" that I was talking about? It has scales from the tip and gradually 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.420
 Fade to become transparent. So I took some pictures under microscopic (light) to see 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.480
 Exactly what color I should use in counterfeit images. But I discovered that it was not only those diapers 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.520
 There seems to be some kind of capillaries. When I took this to Dr. Simons I learned two things: 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.540
 First, I know that the color of those scales is floral because I took a picture of them 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 But it has the structure of holes as we saw earlier, this is strange, as it looks 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.600
 Already that dyes do it. Secondly, capillaries are not bristles. 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.650
 I mean look at this. This is madness. What happens and why? 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.660
 I mean there is a microscopic structure but it does not seem to lead to a phenomenon 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.680
 Visual Because this is on the transparent part of the wing, why would a butterfly need something like this? 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.710
 I mean, the information needed to build something like that 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.840
 The energy that goes to something like this is incredible! So why not? 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.860
 For a moment let's agree that something as simple as a butterfly 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.880
 Contains a complex gas that I or you will not understand. 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.980
 And this .. this is beautiful 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Wow. that's cool 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.020
 Thank you so much for your time .. Video like this is very difficult to install with some, often needs 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.030
 To many people, such as Dr. Symons as an example, genius. 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.080
 There is also Laron who has painted images of the electronic microscope that is on the Facebook page 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.140
 If you want to download them. Also Henry of "Minute Physics" took time for the animation industry to process 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.170
 Zoom in and out of me. I could not do it myself. That was great, of course Gordon was writing the music 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.200
 And many many people, but more important than audible.com, 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.260
 Because they raised money for me to do things like 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.290
 Driving to Atlanta, so they fund "smarter every day" so if you consider 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.340
 Help audible.com like "Smarter Every day" by downloading 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.360
 Free Audio Books Go to: audible.com/smarter and browse their titles 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.410
 There are about 100,000 books I was reading one of them now "The Shark's Paintbrush" 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.450
 "Tradition of nature" and how nature inspires inventors. There are some of the "tradition of nature" 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.480
 Here I would like to talk about it in a subsequent video, I think you will love it, but whatever, more important than this 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.520
 Go to audible.com/smarter and do not forget to download some books to help 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.570
 "Smarter Every Day" You are smart people, you know what I mean, whatever I am 

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.600
 You are sacrificing smarter every day. Thank you for your time, good times 

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.620
 - Is she she would like to be in the video? 

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.660
 You would like to have as many fans, so try putting me in your video .. - hard? You have no idea 

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.680
 Nothing on this little jerusalem nor quite seems 

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.720
 It's a butterfly shape, but somehow a gel material inside 

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.760
 Its cocoon makes a microscopic structure, "Glory be to Him" 

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.860
 - What do you paint here at the bottom? - butterfly sails 

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.900
 - Where are those scales? - On wings. - How did you know that? 

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.950
 Because you are making a video [laughing] 

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.010
 -right Now? - Yes now 

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.050
 Well, obviously, I got the maximum number of fans because 

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.070
 "Princess" in the video is true ?? Bye bye!
