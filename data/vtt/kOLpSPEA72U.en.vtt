 [music] 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.110
 Hey, I am in Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.150
 Well, we just got off this boat and walked about an hour for the jungle 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.180
 to find a chalk pot *. Okay, Phil just found him. {* N.del.T: "Moth", butterfly at night.} 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.260
 What are we seeing here, then? (Phil) That's the chrysalis here 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.280
 from a moth of the Urodidae family. Then, the moth itself 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.310
 It does not look too special, but this chrysalis from here, it's simply 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.320
 incredible - Then that inside is the chrysalis? - Yup. This is 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.330
 the chrysalis itself and then that from the outside is the cocoon. 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.380
 So most of the hives would make a really resistant silk cocoon 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.390
 and they would try to hide inside, but this girl has a different strategy. 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.420
 And what he does, it's just hanging up to about 30 centimeters 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
 under a leaf and then makes its cocoon there. 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.460
 And this probably protects you more from ants 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.510
 that no other thing. - However, it seems contraintuitive to build something like 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 this one It's almost flat, 'Hey guys, look at me.' Oh shit! 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 Look where I was leaning. Oysters! 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.600
 - You have a butterfly on the hat. You know? - In my hat? Where 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.610
 Oh yeah - It's a satyr. - A satyr? 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.650
 Right now I can only think of these ants. You are using a lens 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 macro or just one of the 100? - I am using a 105 macro. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
 I should be able to see the small part of the structure ... - Oh, that's great. - ... of this cocoon. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 It's really special. In fact, you can find it in North 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.760
 America if you are lucky. - Then, like ... OK, it will become 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 in a moth, right? So how come out of here once it's ...? 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 - It seems, if you look at the bottom, it's almost like a small escape route. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 So it could be that once you leave as a muffler it will simply be thrown directly down. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.880
 - Do you want to put your finger down so that we can see the scale? 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 Did you do the manicure? Are you ready for that? 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 - I've been cleaning my nails all day long. - Great. 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.960
 [music] 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 OK, then. Please, make this transition with me. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 As soon as I returned from the Amazon I had to go to a wedding reception. While I was talking there 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 a little with this man I begin to explain this beautiful cocoon I found in the rainforest 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.080
 because it hit me a lot. So I told him that if a cocoon is to keep it 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.100
 Far from predators, why should I get holes for my cocoon? 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 And the man said something that hit me. Say 'Oh, that's interesting. It turns out I'm a farmer 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 butterflies'. I have come here to Mr John's house, and I have taken it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.200
 My children are with me, and John is the owner of one of the two Alabama butterflies farms. 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.240
 It will teach us a bit about cocoons. How do you come butterflies? How does that work? 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.270
 (John) Well, this is an interesting question. It is, in fact, one of my favorite questions to answer. 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.300
 [laugh] But this is, in fact, the way I usually send butterflies. 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.320
 Just like that And I will fill them up and make layers. Most of my butterflies go 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.380
 Zoos, botanical gardens throughout the country. - So you really do not come in like 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 Ten times, you sell them for hundreds, right? - Correct. I would say that the average size of my orders is 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 About a hundred butterflies a week. So what are we here, this is a cocoon of Actias Luna. 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.460
 And a lot of people do not know that there is a difference between the cocoon, here 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 and the chrysalis or pupa, here. 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.530
 And the difference, in fact, is not so great. In the cocoon it is, in fact, 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.550
 your chrysalis. So that, the cocoon itself, really 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.560
 It is only the coverage that the chrysalis makes around. If you look here 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 to Papilio Troilus, this one does not have cocoons. So it is only 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.610
 the chrysalis, while Actias Luna is made from cocoon around 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.660
 the chrysalis. - This is the photo of what we did in the rainforest. 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.670
 - Yes, this is a nice example of a cocoon. - Because 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.690
 Here I am seeing that these buds are solid, but there were holes in that 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.730
 cocoon Why should I do that? - Well, in fact this is an important defense mechanism. If you look 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.760
 The cocoon in this Actias Luna is woven very strongly. 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.790
 So if that hung on a tree like what you found 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.840
 In the Amazon, if it hung in that way, it rains in very large 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.890
 Quantities, it would really end up filling with water and drowning the chrysalis. 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.010
 So these big holes, in fact, allow the rain to fall through, 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.060
 instead of filling the chrysalis. - Oh, so does the chrysalis actually have to have air? - Correct, yes. 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.110
 People do not think too much, but the chrysalis breathe, just like any other animal lives. They need air 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.150
 So if they are surrounded by water, if that cocoon could be filled with water, the chrysalis would really be drowned. 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.170
 - Oh, caram. Interesting Well, thank you very much John. - They do not deserve, I have enjoyed it. 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.190
 - One last thing. We feel like using the term crisÃ¡lida. This comes from Grec crests, which 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 it means gold Some butterfly chrysalis have a metallic glow, so that's why 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.230
 which are called crisalis. I found something very interesting. Okay, my goal was to learn, 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.280
 that you enjoy, and maybe you would see something beautiful that you had never seen before. Now I will try 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.320
 win me your "Like" or your subscription by giving, in the description of the video, the link to the cocoon photos 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.360
 in high resolution, because it is quite impressive. In any case, I'm in Destin. 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.390
 You are getting smarter every day. Have a good time. 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430
 (Destin) Gerson, I have to ask, what are you doing, nano? 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.470
 - Go back and use binoculars. [laughs] 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.480
 - I think Gerson needs glasses. [laughs] 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.520
 When do you live here? - Well, 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.540
 i am from here I was born here. In fact, I know this place very well. 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.590
 I have been guiding the area for ten years, and I had never seen that 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.630
 before. - Never? Is it not that you are not too good and good? 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.670
 [laugh] - I like birds more than butterflies, 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.710
 but he always made me in the details, in the new things, 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.750
 Because I like these things. But I had never seen that, honestly. 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.770
 - Great, so you've lived here all your life and you have not seen that ever. - Not really. 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.790
 And if you want to go see John's things, I could or could not make a link, depending on what we decide on. [Laugh] 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.810
 So whatever it is, have a good time. 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.173
