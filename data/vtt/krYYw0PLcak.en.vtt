 I am Destin and welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So ... are we in my daughter's bathroom now? 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.001
 I have been told that here is a spider that uh, 

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.002
 Well, I am the father. That's what I do. I slaughter spiders. 

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.003
 And so, before I kill him in a great way, 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.004
 wherever I choose to go, I go this one 

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.005
 put macro lenses on this camera to see if we have a pair 

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.006
 'close-ups' can get a violin spider. So, 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.007
 this must be interesting. Here he is. 

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.008
 Let's put one lens on it. Violin spiders have say 

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.009
 eyes, in contrast to the eight eyes that spiders normally have. They are poisonous, 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 so they inject poison into the body. There is a difference between injecting poison and possessing poison on the body. 

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.011
 When violin spiders come into contact with people, they just bite 

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:52.012
 about 50% of people. They are not very aggressive. But, another 

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:56.013
 interesting fact is that when they come into contact with pappies, 

00:00:56.014 --> 00:01:01.500
 those little daughters have, they die by fire in 100% of the cases. 

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.015
 I wonder if that's the web? [Many pesticides that are effective against the violin spider are now illegal] 

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.006
 Does he make material that came out of the side? [Many pesticides that are effective against the violin spider are now illegal] 

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:08.017
 [Death tamping or glue traps are the only proven eradication methods] 

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:12.017
 Does not matter. It is dead and he will not hurt my daughter. [Death tamping or glue traps are the only proven eradication methods] 

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:20.018
 OK, that seemed a bit brutal, but I'm not kidding when it comes to my children. And before you complain 

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:24.019
 in the comments: the reason I did not kill him immediately is that I live in this area 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 where those spiders live, let them know exactly how these spiders work 

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.021
 look. You look for the violin-like stain up their back shield. 

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:36.022
 Those are the spiders that have hemotoxins in their poison and that will hurt, 

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:40.023
 very. These animals can live for months without eating or drinking. They hide 

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:45.024
 in duvets and you get them out of your closet, without you thinking about it. Put them on your bed 

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:49.025
 and they will bite you and before you know it, bits of your body will rot off. 

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:53.026
 I do not always kill spiders, but when I do, I try to do this with fire. Anyway, I'm Destin 

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:57.027
 and you become smarter every day. Just kill them with fire, do it for me. Good day. 

00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:59.500
 After this I go back to the Amazon rainforest. Bye. 

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:07.029
 [MUSIC] 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 It is a scorpion without a tail. - Oh guest, 

00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:13.031
 that is the ugliest beast I have ever seen. 

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.032
