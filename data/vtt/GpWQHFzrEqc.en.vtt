00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 Peace be upon you, I'm Dustin, and welcome to "Every day smarter" 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.260
 I have just interviewed the President of the United States of America 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 It really is strange to me because I'm not a journalist 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.360
 I'm not a politician, I'm a rocket engineer 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.660
 I will, however, take a different view from the rest of the people 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.180
 The interview with the president is something different because you learn a lot about it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.120
 The White House is also definitely, but you learn things about yourself as well 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.660
 The video will contain 4 paragraphs 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 1. How it happened. 2. What were my goals from this interview 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.460
 3. The interview is complete. 4. And what is declared of it. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.700
 What I understood is that there were many candidates to meet the president 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.160
 At one point, it became one of the candidates most likely to do so 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.400
 I did not register on the basis of liberal or democratic, and the question was asked: for the benefit of the voice 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.920
 And I did not answer 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700
 But the way I answered it made it clear to me 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.860
 I will not be selected for the interview 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.080
 And it happened the opposite and I chose 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.320
 It was a secret for 3 weeks and then went to Los Angeles to film an interview. 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 There she met Adnold and Ingrid 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 They were very fun and humble too 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.840
 When I returned home I asked suggestions about the questions I should ask on the Internet 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060
 I received all kinds of answers 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.020
 I mean good and bad too. It was fun 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.180
 But think about it, I do not agree with the president on all issues 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.760
 So I learned it was a great opportunity in front of me 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920
 I was able to sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how to run the country in my view 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.600
 Or I would accept that he sees things differently than I think 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 And to try a deep, intelligent and respectful interview. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.140
 My goal was not only a smart and respectable interview 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.420
 With someone I may not share my opinion on some topics 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.640
 But I was hoping to prove that it would be fun. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 For that, I went to Washington where I met the president. 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.360
 Yesterday the meeting, we went to the studio 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.840
 In Maryland, we trained on it with Frederic 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 He's a Google employee, a very funny man. 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.620
 The next day, we went to the White House and we met a dog president 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.760
 Which was in fact very soft. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.740
 We have settings and make sure we move correctly what we need 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.960
 Each of us went to a corner to review the questions for the last time 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 To make sure we adjust what we say. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.060
 Then the President waited for us to come and we started the interview 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.520
 The president had told us who we were 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 Susie would give him a light about the interview, 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.460
 And then I was watching him with a video 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.740
 Then Ingrid would ask him what was in his pocket. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.380
 Many people wanted to know, once I read these, cards 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.040
 In the White House, these cards are available, before the interview. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.300
 The answer is: no. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.280
 What I did is 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.460
 I looked him in the eye all the time 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460
 This was evident, through his physical expression 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.340
 That makes him comfortable 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 That impressed me. When I was aware of it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.700
 I said to myself: Yahah, a citizen who came back to the White House 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.560
 In an interview with the world's most powerful man, 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.360
 In an interview on live broadcast 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.560
 This is very transparent. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.020
 I do not care what you say about the man's policy, 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.720
 But that impressed me, and I liked it a lot. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780
 For several reasons, I was not nervous, really 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.140
 I was so excited about it. 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.860
 I decided to ask questions first 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.680
 On how to develop his intelligence in areas that may not be his specialty. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
 The answer was important, because it is clear 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.420
 Has changed its means throughout the presidency. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.660
 While he was answering, it was clear to me that he was in a traditional position to meet 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 His body was untouchable 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.280
 Remember that until now the president is not aware of the quality of the interrogators I am. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.980
 For information, I could have been tough. 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.840
 What happened next is something I will never forget 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.920
 I learned that we were on the same wave, 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.620
 I really wanted to make it clear to him, 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.520
 He listened to him for 10 hours through recorded books. 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520
 Note the face of the President, 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.360
 You will see the moment when we were contacted. 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 Opama: I think it's compatible with, 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.220
 You are aware of this, the approach of scientists to address problems in general. 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180
 Destin: Actually I've listened to your recorded books 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.340
 And in "my father's dreams," 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.080
 He concluded by addressing the National Democratic Convention of 2004. 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.860
 Did you see that? Let's go back and take a look at the language of his body. 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.340
 He was discreet, and then the call happened. 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.400
 Is not that great? 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.920
 It was the moment when she was really interviewed 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.860
 It became fun and smart 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.060
 Between two people who want each one for the better one. 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.380
 It was a wonderful moment, and I will never forget it. 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.740
 My second question was about polarization. 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.920
 It was clear to me that the country knows two poles very much about what it was before, 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.280
 In fact, there are data to make sure. 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.980
 Whatever your point of view, it has become very common to make fun of 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.400
 From the other side and to blame him for all the country's problems. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.020
 The president explained why this is growing. 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.220
 Obama: The problem is that, when we return to our policy, 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580
 Whatever the reason, 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.460
 This is largely related, as you know, to the media 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.880
 Some people only watch Fox News 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880
 Others do not, only read the New York Times, 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.100
 And so they are not starting from the common points between them. 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.460
 They take two positions in their view of the world only. 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.920
 Dastin: In the field of theoretical enmity, there are so-called "magnifying results" 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.660
 There is what is positive and what is negative views. 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.040
 If you remove the negative from any two systems, the discrimination will occur and create chaos. 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.780
 This is not the science of politics, this of mathematics. 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860
 When people listen, from right or left, to the media that pleases them only 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.620
 This is dangerous. 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.980
 There are no negative responses that bring you back to the moderate middle, and this will lead to extremism. 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.040
 I liked what the President said on this point, 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.360
 Because it is the responsibility of each of the parties in the political dialogue 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.520
 To listen to the arguments of the other. 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.020
 Otherwise, you will be in the echo room, and you will only hear those sounds 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.020
 That inflated, what, you want to hear, and then a little will only remain a controversy. 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.420
 My third question was about space, where the president shook hands, 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.040
 I forgot to be a respected and respected gentleman. 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.820
 On the whole, you can see in my face how excited you are to this question 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.100
 I would like the viewer to listen to the President's answer. 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.560
 I wanted to end this with a funny observation, so I asked him this interesting question from Reddit: 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.780
 Destin: If there is something to be called after you, opium 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.680
 I hope that this is the first time that you have been asked this question. 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.500
 OBAMA: I never got that question. 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500
 Destin: Excellent 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.400
 the question is: 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.740
 Obama: This is the first time. 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.940
 Destin: So what do you want this tool to be 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.820
 Obama: What is the tool ..... What will be .... 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.820
 Destin: The tool is an opium. 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820
 OBAMA: The question is, what will be the affairs of Obama? 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.900
 Destin: That's true 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.980
 Obama: That's important 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.740
 Dosten: I will not show all his answers now, and I encourage you to see the whole interview 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.060
 You will find it full in the White House Channel. White's House Channel. 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.600
 It is time to talk about what you have learned from this experience. 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.980
 The exercise of thinking about questions to ask the most powerful man in the world 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 It's different from being at home or chatting with your friends 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.060
 And planning to go and sit, and look into his eyes 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.440
 And ask questions. 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.260
 I united myself I would like to know more, 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.700
 More mutual and more compassionate. 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.300
 Why? Why do we tend to be disrespectful? 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.980
 These two things are what I have learned from the president's interview on how to communicate with people 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.740
 May differ from them. 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.240
 No. 1. If you write or chat with someone in your phone, 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.360
 I will say that I sit with that person, and look at them in the right, 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.940
 Because I want to be respectful and tolerant. 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.800
 # 2: If you can listen, that's great! 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.100
 Think about it, if I listen, not just ride my answer to show that I'm smart, 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.340
 But if he really listened to contact with them from heart to heart, 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.320
 My credibility and the extent of my influence on that person will increase! 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.060
 Even if he was the most powerful man in the world, think about it. 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.880
 Respect and listen. 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.260
 It's really simple. 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.460
 But that is very hard. 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.660
 And thank you, it went from the rockets, 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.260
 To the President's interview .... This is really crazy! 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.660
 In any case, if this is the first episode you see on the channel every day smarter 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.060
 For some reason, you feel comfortable joining the channel, do so, 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.240
 But only if you think it's worth it! 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.720
 Another scoundrel, I thank the fans who supported me from the start 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.460
 To date, this is awesome and is Audible.com 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.460
 So I prepared for this interview, 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.840
 I shot some shots from the White House to tell you what I learned. 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.400
 I hope you enjoyed my experience at the White House. 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.600
 If you are interested in listening to President Barack Obama's books, 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.540
 The first is "Dad Dreams", you can get free sermons on Audible.com/smarter 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.160
 And I really advise you this book, it is an excellent reader, 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.400
 Fabulous. Another book, "The Audacity to Hope" 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.360
 You have full freedom to check out these books, and I suspect it is, important to you 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.480
 Be aware of the ideas of the country. 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.480
 On the whole, I would like you to pass on Audible.com/smarter 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.480
 "The audacity on the amps" and "My father's dreams." 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.120
 He was with you Dustin. To win every day is smarter! I wish you a pleasant day!
