 I am Destin from Huntsville Alabama. These are Sadie and Spotsy. So here comes my question: 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.001
 If you make a free fall in one direction in the International Space Station (ISS), 

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.002
 without touching anything, without getting a twist and without airflow against you, 

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.003
 you can then move in a certain way so that you are able to turn to another 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.004
 gradual direction and then stop, without the conservation of the torque 

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.005
 to violate? At Smarter Every Day we demonstrated this with a high-speed camera and a cat, 

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.006
 which is non-holonomic (non-holonomic system) and which can thus do so by extending its legs, bending its back 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.007
 and then turning it with a specific pattern. So can people do this in orbit? I would like a 

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.008
 visual demonstration from the International Space Station, after which you tell me if 

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.009
 your brain had to figure it out, or if you instinctively knew how to do it. Anyway, 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 thank you for helping us get smarter every day and uh ... you want to say hello to the 

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.011
 astronauts? - Hello - Thank you. We look up to you. 

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:56.012
