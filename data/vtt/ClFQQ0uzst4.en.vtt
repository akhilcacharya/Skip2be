Hey it's me, Destin. I'm in Baltimore.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.515
[Mascot blows raspberries]
[Destin laughs]

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.578
Thanks.

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:09.619

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:12.447
So let's say you want to make
yourself smarter on electronics,

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:13.998
but you're not, uh...

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:16.954
You're not really swoofed
on that kinda stuff.

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.125
Oh, looky here, it's the
National Electronics Museum.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.085
Why don't we go have a look?

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:27.504
John McCarty is here. He's
a volunteer at the museum.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.935
We have a demonstration for you

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.065
to show you the relation between
current flow and magnetism.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.108
So there's a magenet right here,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.610
on this side of this tube.
We have a coil of wire

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:41.145
hooked up to a galvanometer,
basically, that's measuring amps.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.196
It's set up for DC amps.

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:47.055
So when we twist this, the magnet's
gonna fall through the coil

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.352
and you'll get current flow here.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:53.117
So you can see the current spike.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:56.614
So here's the question: when
we turn it the other way,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.470
are we going to get positive
current or negative current?

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:01.526
So that's the question.

00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:05.782
So if you think it's gonna be positive
- if the needle's gonna go that way,

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:06.997
click here.

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:09.715
If you think the needle's gonna
go that way, click here,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.614
and afterwards we'll get
Mr. McCarty to explain it, so...

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.189
Click now.
