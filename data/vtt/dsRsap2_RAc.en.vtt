00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hello again, I (Destin) and welcome back again (the smartest every day), do you know that in the sixties and seventies of the last century 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
 When astronauts went to the moon in Saturn-VIV (Saturn 5), they left 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
 Leave experiments on the moon? In fact there is one and there is still work to date 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 And it still works. We still get data from them. But before I explain it, 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.130
 I need to go to the bathroom. [Voice of the toilet] 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 OK. Here I went to university and we shared this building with NASA, and this is interesting because every time 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.220
 Wash my hands after using this bathroom, think of the moon. Look here. 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.260
 On one wall we have a mirror, and on the other wall we have another mirror and two are paved 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.300
 Now all this is fun, but what I want to talk about today 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.350
 he is here. No matter where you go in the room, 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 Always see the camera lens in the corner of the mirror. That's for this 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 Important applications, for the NASA science on the moon. Now this is important! 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 I have asked Henry, from MinutePhysics to explain this to you. Let us see what has come to us. 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.440
 Henry: A reflective angle like this, is a wonderful device, simple and innovative. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.490
 It takes advantage of the fact that the mirror reflects after one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 From the world. If you have a second mirror, you can reflect the image to the initial position. 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 But if the second is vertical on the first with 90 degrees, the reflection is reversed 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.550
 As if the world had rotated 180 degrees. If you send a beam of light 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 To the reflective angle, regardless of which direction the radiation was sent, or in which direction the reflected angle was directed 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.620
 The beam of light will always be reflected, rotated 180 degrees by the falling beam 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.650
 Dozen: If you look here at the top of the camera you can see that my name is reversed 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 But if you bring it to this side in the corner, 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 Look at this. You can read it. You can probably see the writing a bit better than on my shirt. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.710
 Can not read it ... possible now. This is because you tell the reversal reflection. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.720
 But look at this now. If I'm looking at the corner and then tilt the camera up, 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.750
 I am no longer within the scope of the mirror. I can not see the lens after that. That means I am not 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 In the real reflection path like Mill tried to explain to me Henry. Henry: That's because those mirrors 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.810
 Reflect only the two-way horizon. There is no mirror to reflect you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.860
 In the vertical direction. If you have a third mirror on a vertical angle, 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.870
 The mirror image will be reversed (in the horizontal direction), and then reflected again, so the name will be back. 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.900
 But at least now you can move the camera or your eye where you want, 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.930
 As long as you can still see all three mirrors, you'll see a reflection of yourself in the middle 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.960
 Mathematically, if you want to reverse a vector, you need to reverse all its dimensions, 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.990
 So you need to get three mirrors to get a full, three-dimensional retrograde reflection 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.010
 One mirror for each dimension. (Destin): Oh. This is just like reflectors on the road. 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
 If you look closely at this reflector, which my wife hit with a piece of grass, you can see 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.040
 A small reflective angle. (Henry): Exactly! But they are folded. 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
 On purpose, because the reflective, high-resolution angle will return light 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.090
 Headlamps in your car and not your eyes. (Destin): Oh, oh chance! I have 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.110
 A set of high-resolution reflective angles here with me in Germany. and who is this? 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 He is Johann, a laser man from the Netherlands. You remember him, do not you? 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.150
 This reflective angle is very accurate, 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.160
 To a degree, I can set it here on this bridge, and go along the river to the next bridge, 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.980
 And if I hit it with laser and still I can get a reflection, even though it is snowing. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.190
 Watch! 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.200
 What do Johan do ?! 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.210
 Johann: I'm warming up the laser. Dozen: [laughing] Well. 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.260
 And ah ... why do you do that? - In order to get the correct temperature. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.290
 Because it is very sensitive to temperature. - Oh, okay. Can it be done? Can you infect me? 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.300
 Inverter there? Here, you obviously get a reflection. 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.320
 You get a return. What distance do you think 500 meters? - but 350 m 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.320
 - How do you know that? - Count the steps. [Laugh] 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.360
 - Well, here's the question. If Johann is able to get a really good reflection 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.380
 At 350 meters, in the snow, using a manual laser 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.420
 Which he had blown up in advance to keep him alive, what can we do if we put him down 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.450
 High resolution laser reflector on the moon. Actually, 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.470
 That's what the Apollo team did, what team? - 11, 14 and 15. 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.490
 - Apollo 11, 14 and 15. They put reflectors on the moon 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.040
 We still use the test for today. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.570
 (Henry): That's right. Such as monitoring the distance to the moon. If you calculate the time taken by the photon 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
 To reach the moon and back, you can double the time at the speed of light and divide by two 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.630
 To know the distance to the moon, accurately up to several centimeters. (Destin): Exactly Henry! 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.640
 If you have been fired on the moon by laser ... 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.690
 Will bounce after 2.56 seconds later, divided by two, ie the distance is 1.28 seconds, 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.220
 to the moon. If you calculate the output ... this is the distance from Earth. 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.770
 Henry: Anyway, this is useful for understanding nuances 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.810
 The rotation of the moon and its orbit, and measuring the movement of tectonic dishes here on the ground, 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.840
 And even test the basic principles of general relativity theory. Dozen: No reflective nook 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 Used only in optics, you can also use it for any type of reflected electromagnetic radiation. 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.910
 Here, in Frankfurt Germany, there is a long bridge 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.940
 Its big pillars are under the bridge. We have a large boat 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.990
 About to go under the bridge. There are reflective angles. They are not 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.010
 Mirrors, and even metals. This guy only uses radar to guide 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.040
 The boat without hitting the bridge. It's basically 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.050
 Beacon, it is not a light beacon, but a radar. 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.100
 Henry: Awesome! The reflective angles are like a lighthouse that tells you about the distance, 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.110
 But it's better because it does not need to source its own versatility. That's why it was a good experience 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.120
 To leave on the moon. In fact, astronauts have left other undesirable objects on the moon. 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.130
 Come to my channel, MinutePhysics, and tell you everything about it. 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.160
 [Music] 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.200
 This is how the Apollo men went to the bathroom, in the command unit. 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.220
 What did they do on the lunar vehicle? - (Henry): I imagine it's somewhat similar. 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.230
 - most likely left on the moon. Do you realize there may be .. - There may be litter on the moon. We did not realize it! [Laughter] 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.250
 I did not even think about it. We always talk about other things 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.310
 The stuff they sent. - (Henry) Have you left litter on the moon? [Laughter] 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.350
 I imagine they should do it, why would they say that? - When I walk long distances, I try to find an excellent place 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.360
 That man . The man with that won that game. [Laughter] 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.400
 Henry: Move a mobile toilet. [Laughing] A mobile toilet is out 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.410
 On the moon. 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.410
