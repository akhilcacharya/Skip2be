00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
 Hey, it's me, Destin and welcome back to Smarter Every Day, I'm in the middle of the forest. 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.660
 and my son has lost a cheap, small drone. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.140
 And the only way to find out where the drone is, 

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:10.375
 is to light him and listen to where he is. 

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:13.565
 And this made me think about 'focused hearing'. 

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:16.725
 To quickly inform you, my sister bought a toy drone for my son 

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.715
 Which of course he immediately went outside and flew as high as possible. 

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.235
 Then the wind made the drone disappear in the forest. 

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:25.015
 Far out of sight and everything we knew was 

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.935
 that he lay in a large part of the forest. Problem solving 

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.945
 is an important feature that I always try to give to my children. So first 

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.905
 I let them wander aimlessly in the forest and of course they did not find him 

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.985
 And then I decided it was time to start a small adventure. 

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:40.285
 First we spread in the forest and we became very quiet. 

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:43.605
 We then activated the drone and used targeted hearing 

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:46.325
 to see if we could determine where the sound came from. 

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:49.305
 It was very quiet and everyone walked to the direction we thought 

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:52.395
 that it came from and then we all stopped, we became silent again 

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:54.945
 and then we started it again. 

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.725
 At the moment we were a little closer and we felt more confident with our focused hearing
