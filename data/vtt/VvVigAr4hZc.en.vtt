00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:01.188
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:02.514
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.489
I get a lot of questions because of Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:06.430
Some that are personal, some that are about the channel,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.697
all different kinds of things

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:09.764
and I've never really addressed them in a formal way.

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:12.798
So today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna do a question and answer video.

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.300
I've blasted out to all the different types of social media that I use

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.855
the fact that we're doing a Q&amp;A,

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:18.925
and people have sent in questions.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:20.149
So without further ado,

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.683
let's look at the questions that my sister Briley has prioritized

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:25.508
and categorized by different things,

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:27.033
like controversial questions,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.163
funny, video answers, personal,

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:32.567
channel specific questions, scientific or advice.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:34.736
Let's start with a question from the Smarter Every Day facebook page

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.488
where I literally post something so that I get Smarter Every Day

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:38.914
and share that with other people.

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.794
Where did you get the idea of doing Smarter Every Day,

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:42.892
was it a project that you created with your buddies?

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:44.485
The answer is, no.

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.077
I wanted to make a video about how to light a bonfire with rockets.

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:50.347
My wife got a new computer that had video editing software on it

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:52.228
I like to communicate and I like to learn.

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:55.236
So i created the video, it was fun, we enjoyed it,

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.597
and people started watching it, I thought that was pretty cool.

00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:01.832
Later on I decided to actually formally create Smarter Every Day.

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:03.199
I initially called it Pennywhistle Productions.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.351
Smarter Every Day was an attempt to start creating videos

00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.356
before any monetization happened or anything.

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:11.423
I wanted to figure out a way to pay for my kids' college.

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:14.074
The next question comes from the Smarter Every Day instagram page

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.753
which I'll admit is not very good because I'm not a body builder

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:18.437
and I'm not very good at filters,

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:19.952
but anyway you can check me out there if you like too.

00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:21.445
This question is from Justin.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:23.351
What did you go to school for and what are your degrees?

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.500
My undergraduate degree is in mechanical engineering from the University of Alabama,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.109
I got a business minor while I was there also.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.547
My masters degree is in aerospace engineering with an emphasis in rocket propulsion.

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:35.422
The next question comes from Lewis on snapchat,

00:01:35.422 --> 00:01:37.701
which is like a stream of consciousness for me.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.450
I am ilikerockets on snapchat

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.884
and I just post pictures and videos of whatever I'm thinking

00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:45.048
at the moment. It's pretty fun. Anyway.

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:45.960
Here's his question.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.324
- Hey Destin. This might be not only my question

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.328
but a question from a lot of people.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.241
Can you tell us what do you work with

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.129
and what is your relation to rockets?

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.552
- I am a flight test engineer for the Department of Defense,

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.188
specifically I'm a civil servant for the Army.

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.513
I don't work in the Army, I'm not a soldier,

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.005
but I work for the Army.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.532
The best thing to do here is just Google the place I work,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:08.948
Redstone Test Center.

00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:10.253
You'll learn everything you want to know.

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:11.971
The next question comes from the Smarter Every Day

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.692
twitter page which is something where I'm active

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:15.884
pretty much all the time.

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:17.625
It says how did I meet my wife,

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:18.937
who happens to be in the room,

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:20.890
so how did we meet?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.238
- We met in physics at college.

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:26.316
- We met in physics at the University of Alabama.

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.288
Yaaaayyyyy. [laughs]

00:02:28.288 --> 00:02:29.455
The next question comes from Instagram.

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:32.135
Hey Destin what would a fish do in the ISS in a water bubble?

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.348
Well Dr Mark Weislogel at Portland State University

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.125
actually does experiments with this

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.560
in a drop facility.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.951
It's pretty cool, check it out.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.825
Fish tries to leave, but it can't.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:42.968
Eventually it does.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:44.352
That is cool science.

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:45.869
[laughs]

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.011
She sees herself.

00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:48.356
She doesn't know what to do.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:49.476
You're locked in.

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:51.607
Ricky wants to know from Instagram

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:53.580
Can you put up daily videos please.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.010
I do, on snapchat.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.950
From twitter,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.253
How do you deal with the pressure of presenting all of your thoughts

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:01.292
in video to very skeptical and sometimes mean commenters.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.329
What do we do?

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.446
People are saying mean things. Do we let it upset us?

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.416
No.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:08.227
Say no.

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:10.384
Next question, from Facebook.

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:12.441
Oh, my sister, I see what she did.

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:18.517
You're called the biggest blank-hole on earth and as ugly as a turd hope you like it.

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:21.500
[laughs]

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.092
Ahh, next question, from Instagram.

00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:24.000
Do you have any pets?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.976
Yes!

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.038
We have three pets.

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:30.508
We have Spotsy, who is a cat who has 21 spots.

00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:32.686
We have Buckshot, who is a dog.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:34.200
She's a mutt and I love her.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.360
And then we have a third dog named Cody.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.033
She is a three legged dog,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.198
we adopted her

00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:42.326
and we like her a lot, don't we.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:43.329
She's pretty cool.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.566
Can I get a kiss? Kiss?

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:46.445
Nope, no kisses. [laughs]

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:47.479
No kisses, alright.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.453
So, next question is from snapchat,

00:03:49.453 --> 00:03:50.391
from Keira.

00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:52.696
My name is Keira, I'm from New York

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.667
and I was wondering if you ever had a career in the Army

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.348
because I saw your snapchats

00:03:57.348 --> 00:03:59.067
you wear army uniforms.

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:00.278
Very good question Keira,

00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:03.854
like I said, I work for the Army, I'm not in the Army,

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.591
but I do fly as an aviation flight test engineer,

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:08.248
sometimes I fly in helicopters.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.916
And when I do that I wear a uniform basically.

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:13.066
It's a flight suit,

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:15.562
and that flight suit keeps me from catching on fire.

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:16.946
Next question from twitter.

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:19.902
Were you scared of not knowing anything when you were about to graduate

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:20.738
cause I am.

00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:22.232
No I think you're in a good place.

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:25.265
I think it's OK to not be sure of the things that you know,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.810
but you should be confident in your ability to learn new things.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.722
OK a lot of people asked this question.

00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:33.395
Am I submitting an application to be an astronaut.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:34.765
Of course I'm gonna apply to be an astronaut.

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:36.158
I'd love to be on the space station or

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:37.453
wherever we go explore next

00:04:37.453 --> 00:04:39.008
doing blog style updates,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:40.533
Mark Watney style if you will.

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:41.885
That'd be a dream of mine.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:42.888
Now I'm gonna apply.

00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:44.346
I encourage you to do the same.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.386
You've gotta chase your dreams.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.008
There are so many qualified people though

00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:48.434
but I'm gonna give it my best shot.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:49.663
I think it'd be really cool.

00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:51.122
Also, say hello to robonaut,

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:52.512
here on space station.

00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:54.004
Here's a question from Mike on snapchat.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:57.279
- Destin, what is the coolest experience you've had making a video?

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.890
- Man there are a lot of cool experiences.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.653
I don't know, two things that stick out are

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:07.347
diving on the Great Barrier Reef and something that is not out yet,

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:08.668
something I'm editing now.

00:05:08.668 --> 00:05:11.562
I had an opportunity with the air force.

00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:18.464
[jet sound]

00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:21.697
Mr Almostcool wants to know if gravitational waves are real.

00:05:21.697 --> 00:05:22.826
Possibly.

00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:24.383
Toilet paper roll. Over or under.

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:25.352
Definitely over.

00:05:25.352 --> 00:05:26.387
Do you like potatoes?

00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:26.945
Love em.

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.423
Here's a snapchat question from Eleana.

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:30.700
- Hi Destin. I'm Eleana. I'm in Philly

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.982
and my question is

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.000
What does being a father mean to you?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.822
- When I became a father it changed my perspective

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.312
on life in general.

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:40.987
I realize that there are these people that

00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:44.276
not only am I in charge of providing food and shelter for

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:46.825
and stability for their lives and protecting them,

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:48.380
but it's more than that.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.074
It's about modelling character for them, right?

00:05:52.074 --> 00:05:54.171
Because these people are going to make decisions

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:56.512
based on how they observe their leader.

00:05:56.512 --> 00:06:00.040
Fatherhood is about giving my children a safe place,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.104
encouraging them to bloom

00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:06.092
and hopefully help them build into people that are much greater

00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:06.800
tham I am.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.044
I want them to seek truth in everything that they do,

00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:12.286
even if it is a negative thing in the short term.

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:15.200
In the long term I want them to focus on truth.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.075
From twitter,

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.952
How do you go from an idea to the video itself?

00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.252
Interesting question.

00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:20.286
I don't script things.

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:23.411
I shoot footage of things that interest me

00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:24.760
and I learn about it,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.249
over several years in some cases.

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.695
Like the most recent video,

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:28.543
the Mars rover,

00:06:28.543 --> 00:06:29.834
I had footage of the Mars rover

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:30.909
before other people did.

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.365
I did not put it up because I didn't understand it completely.

00:06:33.365 --> 00:06:35.050
So I don't go for the quick wins.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.972
I'll have the footage and not put it up.

00:06:36.972 --> 00:06:39.627
I will focus on understanding the topic.

00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:41.103
And when I understand the topic,

00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:42.635
and it's solidified in my mind,

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.118
and only then do I put the video together

00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:46.453
and try to tell the whole story

00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:48.565
of my journey from knowledge to understanding.

00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:49.351
From instagram,

00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:50.955
What's the biggest mistake I've made in a video.

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:54.688
I can specifically remember two that hurt me even now.

00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:57.533
I misspelled viscosity in the honey coiling video.

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:01.738
In the dragonfly video I spoke to an expert in the UK

00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:06.984
who said that there was a dorsal trachea and that's where respiration happened on the dragonfly.

00:07:06.984 --> 00:07:10.291
I immediately got a call from a true dragonfly expert

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:12.851
whoc challenged me on this and it was wrong.

00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:13.665
That one hurts,

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.732
because I can't go back and change the video.

00:07:15.732 --> 00:07:16.924
I got it from everywhere.

00:07:16.924 --> 00:07:18.453
The religion question.

00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:19.129
Here's the deal.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:20.626
From what I've read on the internet,

00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:23.796
people think that there's the smart, rocket side of Destin's brain

00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:25.974
and then there's this really stupid Jesus side.

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:27.293
And I get it.

00:07:27.293 --> 00:07:30.046
People think that faith is a departure from reason.

00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:31.887
But I think differently about that.

00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:35.231
I feel like personally my faith journey has been propped up

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:39.028
by reason. I know that sounds strange if you're not there with me,

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:40.125
but that's where I'm at.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.750
The most important thing is to remain intellectually honest

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.308
and not just believe something because you're scared

00:07:45.308 --> 00:07:47.152
of what's gonna happen when you die and all this stuff,

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:49.025
but does it make logical sense,

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.002
and I have arrived at a point in my life

00:07:51.002 --> 00:07:52.849
where yes, it does to me.

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.251
People really want to have this discussion

00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:56.317
and argument on the internet

00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:57.320
but I'm not interested in that

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.642
because the world is already polarized enough.

00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:00.980
I want to bring people together,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.237
and so I think the fact that I'm just there,

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:04.434
doing my thing

00:08:04.434 --> 00:08:06.315
and people know that I'm a christian,

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:09.036
I think that's OK, and I'm not trying to convince anybody

00:08:09.036 --> 00:08:09.951
of anything.

00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:12.713
I just want people to look at the world differently

00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:16.328
and use their own minds to draw rational conclusions.

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:17.208
That's all I want.

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:19.311
I know this didn't fully answer the question.

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:23.230
I spoke at skepticon and I think they're gonna put a video up about that

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.728
so feel free to check that out.

00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:27.996
People on twitter, instagram and facebook all want to know

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.318
about the postcard project

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:30.448
and I owe you an apology.

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:33.722
Yes, I did coat the inside of an entire room of my house

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.532
with nothing but postcards that you sent me

00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:36.446
and I read,

00:08:36.446 --> 00:08:37.509
and they're fantastic.

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:39.721
People sent clever stuff from all over the world.

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:42.216
People from Bahrain, from England,

00:08:42.216 --> 00:08:44.765
from Africa, you cannot imagine.

00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:47.223
I read so many delightful things

00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:48.019
It was amazing.

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.501
I had a management problem though.

00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:53.032
I tried to digitize all these things and build a website based around it

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.748
but the problem is you have to remove the personal information

00:08:55.748 --> 00:08:58.363
I can't show you that cause it's got somebody's address on it.

00:08:58.363 --> 00:09:00.918
I had to remove the personal information before I could do that.

00:09:00.918 --> 00:09:02.571
So that's why I haven't provided an update.

00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:04.781
If you want to send something, go find the address, send it.

00:09:04.781 --> 00:09:06.980
Somebody sent a space pen the other day, that was amazing.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.797
Anyway, thank you so much.

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:10.874
I owe you an apology for not doing an update on that

00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:12.497
but I'm very very very thankful.

00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:14.277
I look at them every time I leave my house.

00:09:14.277 --> 00:09:15.187
Question from twitter.

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.255
What's your best dad joke?

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.668
Don't really do dad jokes.

00:09:17.668 --> 00:09:18.781
Question from instagram.

00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:20.943
Have you ever been to Eufaula Alabama?

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:24.018
Well if Eufauala me on facebook you'd know,

00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:25.256
cause I update it more.

00:09:25.256 --> 00:09:27.910
There is a Smarter Every Day sub-reddit and

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.564
leakycauldron says What do your kids want to be?

00:09:30.564 --> 00:09:32.282
I don't know. Hadn't asked them in a while.

00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:33.285
What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:09:33.285 --> 00:09:35.288
- I don't know.

00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:36.336
A teacher.

00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:37.134
- A teacher?

00:09:37.134 --> 00:09:38.296
That's a good answer.

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:39.881
- What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:09:39.881 --> 00:09:40.543
- Cow

00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:41.640
- She want to be a cow?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.941
- What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.006
- A astronaut.

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:46.440
- Who told you that you had to be an astronaut?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.000
- I guess.. [unintelligible]

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.001
- You what?

00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:51.432
- [unintelligible]

00:09:51.432 --> 00:09:52.369
- You wanted to?

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:53.041
- Mm hmm

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.278
- Did I tell you to be an astronaut?

00:09:54.278 --> 00:09:55.603
- No.

00:09:55.603 --> 00:09:56.605
- That's just what you want to be?

00:09:56.605 --> 00:09:58.150
- OK. What do you want to be?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.138
- Batman.

00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:00.528
- [laughs]

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:02.184
You seem to be so well put together as a husband,

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.122
father and a scientist.

00:10:03.122 --> 00:10:04.602
What are some of the things that you struggle with?

00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:09.011
I struggle with selfish ambition.

00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:09.860
I do.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.119
I put that in front of my family sometimes.

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:14.225
And that's horrible, but it's a fact, I do.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:17.071
You don't see me looking for my keys every morning.

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:20.059
My wife makes everything happen in our family,

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:20.953
everything.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:23.130
Anybody that knows us as a couple knows

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.183
that if they want to get something done they contact her

00:10:26.183 --> 00:10:30.158
because I'm busy chasing squirrels or, sometimes literally.

00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:32.005
So.. [baby cries]

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:33.370
there she is right now.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.270
Hey babe, come here.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.313
- I need baby food.

00:10:35.313 --> 00:10:36.124
- You need baby food?

00:10:36.124 --> 00:10:36.898
Hey come here.

00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:38.450
The question just came up, what do I struggle with.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.776
You can probably answer that better than me.

00:10:39.776 --> 00:10:41.359
- Finding his keys.

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:42.758
- [laughs] I said that, what else?

00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:44.897
I struggle with all kinds of stuff.

00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:47.067
Don't I.

00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:48.293
- Saying no.

00:10:48.293 --> 00:10:49.656
- Yeah, I do.

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:51.790
But I struggle, and she makes everything happen.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.997
True or false.

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.416
- I make a lot of things happen.

00:10:54.416 --> 00:10:57.754
- [laughs] So yes, if I'm ever on anybody's pedestal

00:10:57.754 --> 00:11:00.774
please smack me off, cause I don't need to be there.

00:11:00.774 --> 00:11:02.996
OK from instagram donskoi92 wants to know

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.227
what that flashy thing is.

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:05.012
It's a clock.

00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:08.633
Right now it is 7:35. It's pretty easy to read

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:09.838
once you know what you're doing.

00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:12.386
I think it's cool because I can go back and look at a Smarter Every Day

00:11:12.386 --> 00:11:15.339
from five years ago, figure out what frame of mind I was in

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:17.827
when I was doing it, because I can tell if it's like 3am

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:21.043
and it took me four or five takes because I can look at the time

00:11:21.043 --> 00:11:22.307
between cuts.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.919
It's my way of getting back into my brain in the past.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:28.414
Mark from facebook wants to know Why always the same hat?

00:11:28.414 --> 00:11:29.723
I have no idea really.

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:32.568
This was the first hat I wore on the channel,

00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:33.664
I got it out of the garage.

00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:35.190
It says Hurricane Creek Park on it,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.480
a local park I like to hike at.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.815
It's got ventilation in the back,

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:40.218
it's got white on the front for low solar loading,

00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:41.512
I really liked it.

00:11:41.512 --> 00:11:42.809
When it started falling apart I was like

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:44.782
oh man my hat looks trashy, what do I do?

00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:47.503
So this was the closest thing I could find.

00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:48.990
There's no real reason,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.854
it's just something I enjoy.

00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:52.005
I bought five of these

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:53.304
hoping they'll last longer

00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:54.717
and I'm on hat number two.

00:11:54.717 --> 00:11:58.448
So they're lasting me about a year and a half to two years each.

00:11:58.448 --> 00:11:59.259
Gashal from reddit,

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:00.525
Could you tell us a bit about your childhood.

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:01.421
Yes.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.338
Really fun family.

00:12:02.338 --> 00:12:04.934
Four kids, my parents were auto workers. Doers.

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:06.124
My mom is hilarious.

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:08.198
She's on instagram actually, motherofallgoats.

00:12:08.198 --> 00:12:11.696
My dad always took me with him when he would work places at night

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:13.316
so I got to see things about engineering.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.844
He wasn't an engineer but he did engineering.

00:12:15.844 --> 00:12:17.591
My mullet was incredible.

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.963
Nobody could compete with it, even to this day.

00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:21.476
I think it made me better at karate.

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:22.710
So yeah, there you go.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.354
Normal kid, really thick accent.

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:26.928
OK last question from Christie on Patreon.

00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:29.280
Patreons are the people that make Smarter Every Day happen.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.939
They literally give for every video that I make.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:33.691
Do you feel like you're spreading yourself too thin

00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:35.534
in any of the myriad aspects of your life,

00:12:35.534 --> 00:12:37.090
for instance are you getting any sleep?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.541
Christie, I know you well.

00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.125
You're in Florida, you were a doctor in the air force,

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.292
you played wheelchair soccer,

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:43.236
you've got MS,

00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:44.399
you're an amazing person,

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.805
you can look at my eyes,

00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:46.578
you're intelligent.

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:47.936
You know that I'm tired.

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:50.593
But, the reason I'm able to do so much,

00:12:50.593 --> 00:12:52.442
and you're not the only person that asks this question,

00:12:52.442 --> 00:12:53.633
is because of my wife.

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:57.303
With our relationship, the whole is really more effective

00:12:57.303 --> 00:12:58.718
than the sum of the parts.

00:12:58.718 --> 00:13:00.276
My wife, week after week,

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:01.413
sets the ball on the tee

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:02.864
and just lets me hit it out of the park

00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:05.465
and she just, she makes it all happen.

00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:07.039
She makes Smarter Every Day happen.

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:08.047
For those of you that don't know,

00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:09.791
she's DestinsBride on twitter,

00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:11.095
and instagram and all that stuff.

00:13:11.095 --> 00:13:14.040
Anyway, throw some love her way if you don't mind,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.281
and yes, I do need to get more sleep

00:13:16.281 --> 00:13:19.284
and I'm going to concentrate on that in the near future.

00:13:19.284 --> 00:13:20.494
Thank you for the question Christie.

00:13:20.494 --> 00:13:22.960
Speaking of sleep, the last question leads us to the sponsor.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.969
Bailey Cole says how do you and your wife like your Casper mattress?

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.781
I sleep like a baby on the thing.

00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:29.815
It's really pretty cool.

00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:31.403
They send the thing to your house,

00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:32.792
you open it up. It self inflates.

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.665
There's this really cool latex foam.

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:37.131
It's firmer than I thought it'd be, I really like it.

00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:39.335
Anyway, so if you're interested in getting one of these things,

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:42.581
go to casper.com/smarter

00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:45.272
or just use the promo code smarter and get $50 off.

00:13:45.272 --> 00:13:49.223
But, Bailey asked my opinion and my wife's opinion,

00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:52.154
so Bailey this is on you, this isn't on me.

00:13:52.154 --> 00:13:53.784
Let's see what she has to say.

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:56.720
[music]

00:13:56.908 --> 00:13:59.024
Hey, how you doin?

00:14:02.337 --> 00:14:04.501
Bailey wants to know if you like the mattress.

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:08.321
- [tired] I love the mattress.

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:10.345
- What's the best thing about the mattress?

00:14:10.345 --> 00:14:12.838
This is not.. I mean I didn't want to wake you up, Bailey wanted to know.

00:14:13.537 --> 00:14:14.379
- Yeah.

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:18.926
- What does Bailey need to know about the Casper mattress?

00:14:19.537 --> 00:14:20.406
- Stop.

00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:22.219
- Stop what?

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:24.223
- It's firm, it's kind of firm.

00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:25.719
- In a good way, or bad way?

00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:26.926
- It's perfect.

00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:28.567
- If I were to jump right here,

00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:32.315
does it wake you up?

00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:33.684
Or you feel pretty good about it?

00:14:35.137 --> 00:14:36.374
- [whispered] Go away.

00:14:38.054 --> 00:14:41.437
- So do you recommend that Bailey gets a Casper mattress or not?

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:45.507
[laughs]

00:14:45.729 --> 00:14:47.157
