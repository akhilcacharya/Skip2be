Here are Smarter Every Day, we've
decided to change the format

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:05.761
and make learning very very serious.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:06.904
And by serious I mean...

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:08.111
[Thump, splash]

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:09.357
- Seriously awesome!

00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:12.750
[Crowd yells]

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:17.096
[Crowd laughs]

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.081
(Destin) Alright, today we're
gonna learn about mud in Africa.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:21.707
They build houses out of mud.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:24.104
I went to Africa. Let's talk about it.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.193
(Destin) I don't know. I don't
know when I can come back.

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:29.278
(Man) We're glad to have you to come back.

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:31.269
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:34.941
You come, we can make house me and you.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.607
- Oh yeah. And we'll live in the house.
- Yeah.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.649
We'll call it King of Dragons' house.
- Yeah. And Destin.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:45.984
- And Destin.
[Laughs]

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.408
(Destin) So burlap?
- Yeah.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.070
- Okay.
- You see?

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:51.279
- Yeah.

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:54.678
- Oh no. You're picking all that up?

00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:58.514
- Yes sir, no problem.
- Ugh. King of Dragons.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.461
Nothing for the King of Dragons.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:03.608
- He's my younger brother.
- Oh. He's very helpful.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.007
- Yeah, he's very strong.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.227
[Foreign language]
- Do you need the shovel?

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:13.055
Oh, only with your hands.
- Only with your hands, yeah.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.883
- Are hands better?
- Yeah. Hand is better for this one.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.522
When you're making blocks
you use your hands.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:22.534
- Why? Why do you use your hands?

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.185
- Because hands can make this all.
If you want to make blocks here,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.460
 this type of blocks...
- Yes.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:30.797
- Once you make block you use, so...
- Yes.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.347
You see?

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:38.137
When you put it inside, you remove it.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:42.724
Now, [unintelligible].
- Yeah?

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.239
When you get-- when it get full...
- Yeah?

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:48.968
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Does it hurt your hands?

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:50.400
- No.

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:52.975
[Unintelligible] ...my hand.

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:56.222
[Destin laughs]

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.536
(King of Dragons) You pick it up.

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:02.174
- How do you keep from uh...
from making it slump?

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:06.757
Oh, perfect.
- You see?

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:08.331
- Perfect.
- You see? Is nice?

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:11.048
- So the amount of water is important.
- Yeah.

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:14.439
(Destin) Doesn't straw make it stronger?
- Yeah, this one holds [unintelligible].

00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:16.355
- You don't need straw.
- No.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:20.683
- That's a lot of blocks.
- 440 blocks, maybe.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.844
- 440?
- Yeah.

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.879
(King of Dragons) 35 cm.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.266
- So it's twice as long as it is wide.
- Yeah.

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.077
Is very nice?
- Very nice.

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:35.710
- You love it.
- I do. Thank you, Ishmella. Thank you.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.274
(Destin) Yeah, Matt just chipped a tooth.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.768
Spearing me in the mud. Totally worth it.
Was it worth it?

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:57.820
- It was totally worth it.
[Destin laughs]

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.748
- Thanks, Matt.
- You're welcome.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:03.767
[Music]

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.898
...Feedback loops,
so you have to know your position

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:21.719
and where your relative motion is
going, so you can compensate for it.

00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.808
Well, chickens are really
good at this, so...

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:28.237
I'll show you. Watch his
head stay totally stationary

00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:33.873
as I move his body. I can move his
body in pretty much any direction.

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:37.301
