00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 Helicopters have a speed limit that has nothing to do with the law 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.620
 Unless calculated on the laws of physics 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.390
 Hi that Dustin 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.570
 Welcome to the smartest every day 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.750
 I will say everything important about the motor when flying 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.770
 But before we are serious, we have a lot of fun 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.910
 Look! Air travel with Carl 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 (Sound Fan) is awesome! 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.260
 (Sound fan) 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 (Excited scream) 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.200
 (Laughter) 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.270
 There 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 Well we'll be a hero by helicopter at night 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.620
 (Sound fan) 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 (Music) 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.230
 (Music) 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.560
 Have you seen that? See you soon 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.640
 If you see on one side you see this really narrow radius of curvature 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.820
 But on the other side you see a much larger radius of curvature. What is going on there? 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.990
 Well so to explain the effects of this asymmetric travel of blades 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 I've fucked one up on a stick here, and I'll try, let's see if this works 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.360
 There we go. So the blade of the drive come around 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.540
 It moves relatively faster in the air to move the helicopter so you can 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.710
 Add these two values ​​together, but the undo code, subtracts 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.890
 The blade speed away from the air speed forward and that is the total close 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.920
 Speed ​​the blade by air. This causes some funny things. 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.950
 Well do the feathers and check things out. As the flies fly forward, the air 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.120
 The sides of the plane flow. The code is also advancing 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.310
 Travel forward until this adds to the air velocity of the rotor on this side 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.500
 Now as long as the flight speed of the dizziness stays under the sound barrier you are fine. 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.670
 But if a helicopter goes too fast it will create shock and shock shock waves 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.760
 Damage to the bags. The decoding code sees the same airflow from vehicle movement 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.890
 But because the blade is going in the opposite direction of that movement 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.030
 The actual air speed of the rotor is lower. This creates the so-called 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.220
 No homogeneity of lifting, and to counteract this rotor on the dip 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 The side is given more pitch to produce more elevator. This works up 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 To some extent, but if the helicopter goes very fast, the pitch becomes very large and 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.570
 Losing a lift creates a so-called dip-procrastination code. 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.730
 The cool thing about falling down badminton is that it's a self-correction problem. if you think 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.920
 About this subject because of the balanced prism, if you have no homogeneity of the lift between the left 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.100
 The right side of the plane, it will not roll a helicopter like you think it will, it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.280
 In fact he plays it. This is good news because it is as you fly along if you have a very fast 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.460
 And you get the badminton fall back, and it will just slow the plane down automatically. 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.640
 Well there are a lot of things that have not been included in this video series, but for the most part they must be 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.680
 Way smarter than when we started on a helicopter. Smart enough actually where you can make learners 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.790
 Guess which of these three helicopters is the fastest inventory of the US military. 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.920
 While you are considering that please consider going to the Facebook page. I put all the pictures from 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.090
 Nocturnal flights on them. Go download them, use them as wallpaper for your desktop, things like that. While I was there 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.260
 Please like Facebook page. Also if you have ideas for the smartest rings every day in the future 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.450
 Please tweet me, I would appreciate it, are the smartest YouTube. 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.490
 It's been about a year since we started to get smarter every day. If you have ideas for a one year ring I have all ears ears. 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.530
 OK. Rave enough. The answer is a Chinook. Is the fastest in the US military 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.590
 Inventory. In Destin. You get smarter every day. I have a good idea. 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.770
