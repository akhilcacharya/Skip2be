00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:01.258
 Hi, I am Destin 

00:00:01.258 --> 00:00:02.606
 Welcome back to "Be a smart person daily" 

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:04.038
 We talked about in the last video 

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:06.058
 Slow motion under the tattoo is what it looks like 

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.438
 But this time we are going to talk about it 

00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:10.696
 How to remove tattoos is more complex than making tattoos 

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:13.050
 Involved in many physical knowledge, such as thermodynamics, 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.562
 Optics, and even biology and chemistry 

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.350
 In this video we will 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.294
 First get a little tattoo ink and then go to plastic surgery 

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.117
 See if we can get rid of it, let's take a look 

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:23.123
 (Destin) I get some ink ok? 

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.539
 Alright 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300
 [Laughs] Thank you 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.399
 Before discussing how to remove the tattoo 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.596
 Let's talk about tattoos first 

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.351
 What are you getting into the skin? 

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.550
 Many people do not understand this however 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.248
 Tattoo ink color, in fact, the majority 

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:39.756
 Is made of heavy metal compounds 

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.418
 I understand, it sounds a bit crazy, right? 

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:43.929
 You want, you worked hard in the tattoo room, 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.813
 Create a sterile environment, thinking of this 

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.845
 There will be no germs or the like, but if you think about it 

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.358
 They ended up simply and crudely 

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:53.899
 Direct injection of heavy metals into your body 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.908
 It's really scary to think carefully 

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:58.009
 In short, let's talk with professional people 

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.239
 OK, we want to know Dr. Lappert 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.819
 How to remove tattoos with laser 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.353
 He is a plastic surgeon 

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:05.010
 Nice to meet you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.798
 OK, I have some questions to ask 

00:01:06.798 --> 00:01:08.899
 Some looks great machines here 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.524
 Yes 

00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:10.714
 I think ... this is the laser? 

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:11.312
 That's right 

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:14.136
 This side of the ultra-short pulse laser 

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.143
 We used to remove tattoos 

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.425
 Ultra-short refers to - nanosecond level? 

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:19.089
 No, it's even shorter than nanoseconds 

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:19.684
 really? 

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:20.938
 Picosecond level 

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:21.535
 No way…… 

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.704
 After the decimal point 11 0 

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:27.285
 This is the picosecond level concept 

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:29.631
 This is a emerald laser 

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.465
 Emerald laser can 

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:35.568
 Modulated at a specific narrow band frequency 

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:38.510
 But we intend to use light at a wavelength of about 775 nanometers 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.869
 Wow, so it is just at the edge of the infrared spectrum? 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.588
 Correct 

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:43.273
 Ready to get rid of what (tattoo) before 

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:45.343
 I'd like to see what kind of target I am dealing with using a laser 

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.888
 Here I have a small drop of tattoo ink 

00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:49.765
 Then I dropped it on the slide 

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:51.594
 Then put the microscope, hope 

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.159
 We can see these heavy metals 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.857
 We can see these as we zoom in 

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:56.424
 Small particles running around 

00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:58.227
 Then there are some big ones 

00:01:58.227 --> 00:01:59.929
 Recall 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.934
 I recorded before in the last episode 

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:04.151
 Tattoo needle in slow motion to see what the action looks like 

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.576
 [music] 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.969
 We now know the shape of these particles 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.938
 We can draw a more appropriate diagram 

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:35.226
 Tattoo to indicate the process 

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:37.450
 Multiple needles pierce your skin 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.748
 Then grab those large and small ink particles 

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:42.850
 Through the epidermis has been brought to the dermis 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.854
 The tattoo is on the skin 

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:46.733
 However, your body is trying to remove it 

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.283
 The body realizes that these are foreign objects 

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:51.069
 For example, your skin has a small piece of silver 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.137
 Then your immune system discovers it 

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:54.587
 Will think "this guy does not belong here" 

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:55.847
 Will think "this guy does not belong here" 

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:58.823
 The white blood cells will then be responsible for removing the pigment 

00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:03.049
 If you've seen it under the microscope 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.285
 The white blood cell volume is very small 

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.723
 The volume of pigment particles is relatively large 

00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:09.357
 Leukocytes close to them, 

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:12.027
 Try to wrap it around 

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:14.286
 However, because the volume difference between the two is too large 

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:17.989
 So it is hard to wrap the pigment particles 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.723
 It's like trying to bite a small mouth on an elephant 

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.518
 Well, this may seem weird, but I have to try 

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:27.398
 I want to know my blood cells 

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:28.747
 How big is it compared to ink particles? 

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.314
 So clearly I have to puncture my finger 

00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:33.106
 Get some blood and mix it with the ink 

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:34.831
 Well, let's drop it on the glass slide 

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.503
 This looks better than I imagined 

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:39.603
 Still cool 

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:40.639
 Look! 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.157
 Can see the reaction of blood cells and ink particles 

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.381
 Can see the relative size of it? 

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:48.889
 A few ink particles can be seen smaller than blood cells 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.924
 A few ink particles can be seen smaller than blood cells 

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:52.744
 There are some larger particles than blood cells 

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:54.221
 There are some larger particles than blood cells 

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.129
 This means that small particles can pass 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.764
 Leukocyte phagocytosis and clearance 

00:03:57.764 --> 00:03:59.771
 But not big 

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.651
 This is why tattoos are permanent 

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.423
 But it is also why they will fade 

00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:05.173
 Because part of the ink will be cleared by the body 

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:07.091
 But there are still some others 

00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.091
 so cool 

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:09.093
 This is simply a bunker 

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:10.788
 If you look at a freshly made tattoo 

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.455
 He looks clear and sharp, the edge is obvious 

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:15.281
 The color is bright and clear 

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.000
 That's right 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.512
 If you go to see a retired from the Marine Corps 

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.550
 Tattoo on gun chief sergeant 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.616
 That seems to fade away 

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:23.456
 Correct 

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:25.170
 Because these pigments have been leukocytes and the like 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.415
 Derived from the dermis through the lymphatic system 

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:30.120
 Derived from the dermis through the lymphatic system 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.236
 And then shipped to the liver, this process 

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:34.832
 35-40 years have passed on this gunsmith 

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:37.287
 I think you use the guns Sergeant to give examples of really super funny 

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.786
 Because I just knew a few guns and sergeants ah 

00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:40.448
 I am a retired navy 

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:41.390
 Oh, so you can say that? 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.238
 Yes, I have been in the Marine Corps for many years 

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:44.302
 Not bad 

00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:46.559
 As I said just now, the crux of the problem is white blood cells and 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.581
 The relative size of the pigment particles 

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.282
 Granules too large, white blood cells is too small 

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:53.894
 So if you get a suitable laser 

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.279
 Then use a very short pulse 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.376
 To illuminate these paint blocks 

00:04:58.376 --> 00:05:01.653
 The lighted block of paint will crumble 

00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:03.353
 Then with the broken pieces of paint 

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:05.172
 They become smaller and easier to remove 

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:05.897
 right 

00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:08.751
 So you are quickening white blood cells 

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:10.731
 Swallow the speed and efficiency of the paint block 

00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:12.607
 Swallow the speed and efficiency of the paint block 

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:13.765
 Then carry them to the liver 

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:15.336
 Yeah, that's it 

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:19.103
 So you have to use a laser to illuminate the paint 

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:19.676
 That's right 

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:21.232
 Then white blood cells will be put 

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:23.651
 These broken pigment particles catch 

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.622
 Take to the liver 

00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:25.877
 That's right Through the skin under the capillary lymphatic vessels 

00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:28.036
 Gather into larger lymphatic vessels 

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.332
 And finally brought to the liver 

00:05:30.332 --> 00:05:34.375
 Then be processed and excreted there 

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.134
 So how is a light source? 

00:05:36.134 --> 00:05:38.613
 Pigment particles broken it 

00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:39.808
 Think so 

00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:41.814
 Suppose we have a heater light 

00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:43.983
 Then open it, it will launch energy outward 

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:45.740
 To illuminate this side of the ball 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.557
 Then the surface of the ball is heated will be hot 

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.556
 The other side will be colder 

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:51.411
 This difference in calories will result in heat from 

00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:54.518
 Yang negative side pass right? 

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:55.707
 This produces a poor thermal gradient 

00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:58.908
 If we use a very, very, very hot light source 

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:00.163
 Then irradiate it very quickly 

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.265
 Assume that the color of the laser and ink are appropriate for each other 

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.489
 The laser will cause the particles to be shined on the side 

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.220
 It starts to heat up rapidly, too 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.509
 Start to heat up 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.831
 The other side too late to respond 

00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:13.149
 So it is still cold 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.536
 This causes the internal pressure difference to become larger and then the entire particle to rupture 

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.484
 This is why laser tattooing is at the heart of the core 

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:19.588
 The faster it heats up 

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.977
 The easier it is to crush it 

00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:26.116
 The longer the irradiation, the greater the impact on human tissues 

00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:26.836
 That's right 

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:28.775
 However, the shorter the irradiation time 

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:31.228
 The more targeted you are, the more you look at it 

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:31.762
 Correct 

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:35.060
 I feel like I'm really open eyes (laughs) 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.163
 so cool 

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.641
 Once it breaks 

00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.206
 WBC will put these pieces 

00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:40.870
 Through the lymph to the liver 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.440
 Through the lymph to the liver 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.417
 Then finally pull your tattoo out 

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:45.860
 So that's the principle 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.817
 Aiming beam with a He-Ne laser 

00:06:49.817 --> 00:06:51.508
 Low energy, but let me know 

00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:54.013
 The actual laser is irradiating the position 

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.110
 Ready? 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.023
 Ready 

00:06:56.023 --> 00:06:57.374
 Ok, we started 

00:07:08.037 --> 00:07:09.702
 I'll give you treatment now 

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:26.090
 Then you can see what I said 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.909
 "Frost" phenomenon, right 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:29.783
 Correct 

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.791
 Can see it is raised the surface of the skin 

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.457
 That's it 

00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:34.717
 This process of whitening is called frosting 

00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:36.534
 And it only lasts for a few seconds 

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:38.862
 This is due to the particle-level shock wave 

00:07:38.862 --> 00:07:41.215
 This is due to the particle-level shock wave 

00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:43.567
 Dr Lappert said this depends on the color of the ink 

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.492
 A few simple processing 

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:48.034
 The body can completely remove these inks 

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.984
 Okay, I hope this video will be available to everyone 

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:51.961
 If you are going to tattoo 

00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:53.872
 You can know the whole process of the ins and outs 

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.942
 Tattoo in the end get something to the body 

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.667
 The meaning is that they give you physically 

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:59.845
 What stuffed into the body, and the corresponding principle 

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.033
 Think carefully because you get rid of tattoos 

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.440
 It's harder and more complicated than painting a tattoo 

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.607
 So before the tattoo to consider carefully 

00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:08.278
