00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.050
 (Carl) We have the screw here to balance it 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.060
 and we can move the thread in and out to achieve the perfect balance. (Destin) It's pretty clever. I'd bet that 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 he has come to an intelligent paio. (Carl) oh .. a ... bright person. [laugh] 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.610
 Oh oh See. Have you seen it You saw how spring, that? 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.970
 Hey, I am in Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. We are continuing ours 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.160
 I studied the helicopters and we got our best invention from the camera that works 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.340
 with a chicken Well ... Carl has also helped. [laughs] You know, everything 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520
 the thing of the helicopter. It is one of the most dangerous things, and you know that you are living correctly if 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.710
 You need glasses for laser and a helmet. (Carl) And where is my helmet? [laugh below nose] 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.890
 I only have one. He can hide in the toy closet. We are in the room 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.070
 from my son Okay, let's count on what we have here. (Carl) OK. We have put 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.250
 a laser on the shovel of the shovels. (Destin) Lasers are like bacon 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 everything is improved. (Carl) Oi so much. We have balanced everything with our small hi-tech device 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.500
 and we will teach in the form of disc the controls 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.690
 cyclical and collective (Destin) What we do with this is to measure the exit of the step 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.870
 where would the rotor be used? Sorry, it's ... 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 I'm saying it correctly? (Carl) Yes, correct. (Destin) So we are measuring the step in real time 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 while doing the whole turn. (Carl) Getting a nice one 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.120
 visual representation (Destin) Great. Where do you want me? (Carl) Okay, what do you think if ... 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 ah, you put yourself in the back. (Destin) By here? (Carl) Yes, right here. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.320
 and we will project it to the wall. Here we go. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.430
 (Destin) We'll close the ... ah ... close the closet. Oh, another thing that we have done is that when 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.620
 It starts to rotate it starts up using the force of gyroscope 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.680
 Oh, forgive me, the centrifugal force Ready. (Carl) Som-hi. [Rotor ripping] 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 (Carl) OK. (Destin) [unintelligible excitement] 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.920
 (Carl) Well, here we have no way. Everything rolled 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.090
 And if we make an entry to the group, the line goes up 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.280
 With a positive group, the negative will go down. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.450
 If we make a cyclic input the disk 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.490
 or the line will be inclined. Right, left, forward, back. 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.660
 (Destin) To clarify this, we are measuring the step, so 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.690
 the axis of the rotor is not changing at all, except what is the rotation, right? 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.870
 (Carl) Yes. (Destin) OK, so the step of the shovel 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.070
 is changing as we go around, due to the entry of the cyclic plate. 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.200
 (Carl) the handle of the blades changes from positive step to negative step, to each 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.270
 revolution (Destin) Mola. I'm extremely excited 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.320
 with this. It is the best visual representation I have never ... oh 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.500
 there is one more thing. The laser points 90º out of phase, right? 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.620
 (Carl) Well ... yes, but that puts it in the phase in which it would normally work. 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 (Destin) OK, follow. I do not understand how you plan to do this without a helmet. 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.780
 OK, because if you think about it, when you say it is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
 In the phase in which it would normally operate, the laser is illuminating 90 degrees outside (Carl) The laser is pointing this 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.970
 direction, and when we receive a cyclical entrance, it leans forward 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.150
 below, and this ends up having effect at 90º when the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.330
 (Destin) It is the gyroscopic precession. (Carl) Gyroscopic precession. (Destin) OK, because we zoom to the cyclic platter 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.380
 ah, only for people who do not know what the cyclical dishes do, do one 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.560
 (Carl) That's the cyclic platter. (Destin) Collective entrance up. (Carl) Collective up. (Destin) Collective down. 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.740
 (Carl) and you can lean forward, back, left or right. (Destin) This is the cyclic entry. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.920
 Okay, you can give yourself a collective, and you can see it 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.110
 That light rises up, and that would raise the helicopter [unintelligible] 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.280
 Negative, and if we place it cyclically, 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.330
 change the inclination of the line. (Destin) Okay, what's the part of the helicopter? 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.520
 Towards you or this wall from here? (Carl) The front is to the left 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.650
 of the camera. (Destin) You know, let me come here behind 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.800
 and try to grab it on this wall. Okay, come back. 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.970
 (Carl) Okay, we're there. Left, forward, 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.150
 Right, back, up and down. 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.330
 (Destin) This is so great that I want to cry. 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.480
 I think our daily contribution to science is made. (Carl) OK! 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.630
 I'm in Destin. You are getting smarter every day. 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.990
