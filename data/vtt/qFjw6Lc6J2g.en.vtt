00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.114
 Hello this I'm Destin 

00:00:01.114 --> 00:00:02.533
 Welcome again in "Smarter Every Day" 

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.999
 Most people know it to go to the ISS 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.415
 First you have to board the Russian Soyuz 

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.374
 You tighten your belts 

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.584
 It departs from Baikonur Base 

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:10.872
 And is heading directly up towards the International Space Station 

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:13.627
 You open the gate, and then greet your astronaut friends, right? 

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:15.850
 But there are plenty of additional details if you think about it 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.209
 There is actually a physics and mechanics science orbit 

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:20.840
 Which must be studied and tested on the ground before departure 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.782
 So, today in the "smartest every day", we will talk about rocket science 

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:25.490
 I promise that it is not difficult 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.879
 American astronaut Scott Kelly 

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.402
 And Russian Mikhail Mikarniko 

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:30.854
 Is about to travel to the International Space Station 

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:32.231
 For a full year 

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.725
 That is a great event 

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.610
 But before talking about the mechanics of orbit 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.603
 Think about this 

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.279
 Roda space are human beings 

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.900
 Like me and you 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.092
 What would you think if you were restricted? 

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.627
 In that rocket, knowing that you are about to leave the hot tubs for a whole year 

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:48.980
 How good it would be to get into the Russian missile 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.046
 You get a regular conversation from person to person 

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:53.469
 With someone about to do it all 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.636
 Although its scheduled launch time is getting closer and closer 

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.256
 And his time on earth becomes more precious and precious 

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.158
 Scott Kelly was very generous to give us part of his time 

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.878
 And spend it with our team in the Soyuz spacecraft to tell us what it will do 

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:06.405
 This is astronaut Scott Kelly 

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:07.560
 - Hello 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.954
 - Scott is about to do something that no American has done beforehand 

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:11.119
 He will ride one of these vehicles 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.181
 A Soyuz spacecraft 

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.442
 And lead it to the International Space Station, how long? 

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.201
 - I'll stay there for about a year. 

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:21.689
 We will launch in March of 2015, next March this year 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.474
 I will be back in March next year 

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.544
 I mean I'll stay around the year 

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:30.508
 - Well, there is an integrated system of different scientific experiments 

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.578
 Which will be conducted because of it 

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:35.866
 The main goal is to prepare for the Mars trip, which will take a long time, right? 

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:44.197
 - Yes that's right. NASA's remote goal is to put people on Mars one day 

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:47.367
 Well, there will be a lot to learn 

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:53.189
 Some relate to the effects of the space environment on the human body when exposed to it for a long time 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.197
 Specifically develop bone loss, muscle atrophy 

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:59.588
 Effects of cosmic radiation on genes 

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:07.311
 We looked at, got vision problems for astronauts during long-term flights 

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:12.772
 Our immune system, the device of balance in the ear .. means, those sections of the human body 

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.874
 There is also the hardware section 

00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:18.020
 Learn to travel a long journey away from Earth, 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.728
 Is a real challenge to how we design our life systems. 

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:25.516
 How to produce oxygen and water 

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:30.424
 And all that is like it, the electricity ... that keeps us alive 

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:31.876
 In space for a long period of time 

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:33.593
 - It is camping for a true year? 

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:36.633
 - Yes, this trip will be like camping for the year 

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:40.868
 But even though you are in space, you are 250 miles away from Earth 

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:44.421
 Although you're moving at 17,500 miles per hour 

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:50.278
 But you are still in a place where supplies can be supplied continuously 

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.638
 But when you go to Mars, that's not possible 

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:53.978
 - Will you simulate this scenario 

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:58.125
 Would you, for example, change your underwear less frequently or anything else like that (Laughter) 

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.261
 - (Laughter), uh ... I did not plan for that 

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.515
 - (Laughter) These are important things that we should know 

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:07.470
 - Yeah yeah .. But are we simulating anything about .. 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.825
 We will do many experiments on living in space for long periods of time 

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:17.444
 For a specific simulation, I will personally try to imagine 

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.220
 Well, it's six months, maybe we're on the outskirts of Mars 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.360
 And then I will spend a year on its surface, so it will take me .. 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.054
 - because it's something different for you compared to other astronauts 

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:29.410
 It is clear that your brother Mark will remain on the ground 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.544
 As you learn it collects all the data while you are doing so in space 

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:37.879
 But for you, you've scanned the time periods you spent in space 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.115
 If we draw a diagram of it you gradually evaluate for longer and longer periods 

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.974
 So if we imagine what will happen to him 

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:49.901
 It will lead to a parallel length of flight of Mars 

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.772
 - Yes that's right 

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.518
 I mentioned this in a public affairs activity 

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.171
 How my first trip took 8 days 

00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.882
 The second lasted 13 days 

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:59.632
 The third took 159 days 

00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:02.570
 The fourth will take a year 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.405
 If you try to draw a curve, we'll get a second-rate exponential curve 

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:12.890
 If I could travel for the fifth time, 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.141
 "That will put you on Mars, will not it?" 

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.411
 - will give me 5 years, over 5 years in space, so I can easily go to Mars 

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:19.256
 - This is amazing! 

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.477
 - Which means maybe, I will not travel to space again, right? 

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:23.135
 - No, I saw it when you posted it on Twitter 

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:24.584
 When you actually fly 

00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:27.497
 Will be under the influence of great acceleration 

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:30.008
 So how can you press those buttons, for example? 

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:31.799
 - Who sits in this seat can reach. 

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:36.193
 Those who sit in the middle use a stick to press the buttons 

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.392
 - Well, he sticks the buttons with a stick 

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:41.624
 - Yes, it is a luxury stick but stick in the end 

00:04:41.624 --> 00:04:46.413
 I can control some of his valves here 

00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:48.363
 I can get them out better than him 

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:51.127
 - Well you practically control the spacecraft from here to connect it to the international station 

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:56.140
 - Yes, the Soyuz vehicle leader can do so, the Soyuz is generally automatic docking and coupling 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.277
 But sometimes you have to change the system to manual mode to manually control the connection process, and control it from here 

00:05:00.277 --> 00:05:01.154
 - Well, that's really amazing 

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:04.270
 However, we still do not know how the Soyuz spacecraft gets there 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.679
 To get to know this, let's talk to Reid Weisman 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.943
 His recent space mission has set a record for the largest number of scientific research carried out 

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.577
 In one week in orbit around Earth 

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.716
 I did this recently! 

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:13.365
 - Yes, I did 

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:13.884
 - OK 

00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:14.906
 - I did this on May 29, 

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:15.535
 - Is it amazing? 

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:16.183
 - Oh of course amazing 

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.476
 - Well, what happens the moment you arrive in space? 

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.768
 Well, people know the rocket 

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.690
 People know the International Space Station 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.331
 But people do not know what happens between them 

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.713
 - There is little going on between that. 

00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:27.227
 - OK 

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:30.234
 - The journey from Earth to Space takes 9 minutes and a half 

00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:31.858
 This is done using a very powerful missile 

00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:33.235
 All people see it, filled with fuel 

00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:34.796
 Lots of flame, and go up 

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:37.490
 At the end of that phase, you're driving at 17,000 mph 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.251
 - OK 

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.719
 - Well, from there, you have to meet the International Space Station 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.165
 You're going a little faster 

00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.107
 - That's what I want to talk about 

00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:44.993
 - Let's talk about him. 

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:49.582
 - Well, I think as many people do, that the rocket is gradually taking you to the space station 

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.628
 In this ring orbit, but this is not what ever happens 

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:52.271
 - Do you know what to think? 

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:52.756
 - What? 

00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:54.798
 - I have always thought that the rocket was launched vertically and directly towards the space station 

00:05:54.798 --> 00:05:56.014
 - yes I understand you 

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:58.646
 - I never thought he was following a path 

00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.603
 - What is the moment you feel 

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:01.802
 "Oh my God!" I am in space 

00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:02.803
 When does that happen? 

00:06:02.803 --> 00:06:05.035
 - That moment is very clear 

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.612
 It is exactly at the separation of the third missile layer 

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.206
 After 9 minutes and a half 

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:10.829
 And then after a trip (by your acceleration, there is no engine) 

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.651
 The accelerator falls away 

00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.968
 And you feel that you really float 

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:17.029
 Because you are still in your seat 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.894
 Stark layers will put you in high security 

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:20.209
 Outside the Earth's airspace 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.705
 The missile will not fall down 

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:22.638
 There will be no great drag on it 

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:23.585
 So he will stay there 

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:26.406
 From that stage we will have a series of fires, 

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.565
 With a Soyuz vehicle, we carry 7 naphtha 

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:32.146
 The first two to do the homan transition to the top orbit 

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:33.458
 - Well, understand. Let's explain it. 

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.208
 Homan transmission, make sure I explain correctly 

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:38.091
 Homan transmission is when you are in circular orbit 

00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.843
 You want to move to a larger or smaller country 

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:43.537
 You draw a minus between the orbits, is that true? 

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:44.549
 - That's true. You will fire in one direction 

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.518
 After 45 minutes for us, you will have another 

00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:49.095
 Because you will be on the other side of the planet 

00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:50.320
 They are just under 45 minutes 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.468
 - Your understanding, okay 

00:06:51.468 --> 00:06:52.917
 - But then and accurately 

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:55.308
 It will make you move from one orbit to another 

00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:56.531
 Larger or smaller 

00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:59.701
 - I understand, two jets to carry the Hooman transition, gorgeous! 

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:01.544
 Then the second maneuver 

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:02.835
 It is a little sly 

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:03.605
 We do not know exactly where we put the accelerator 

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:05.356
 Let us know exactly where we will enter orbit 

00:07:05.356 --> 00:07:08.298
 It could be slightly higher or slightly lower 

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:12.715
 We move a little faster or a little slower 

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:15.723
 - Why? Is it because of the difference between rockets? - Each missile is different from the other, even if it is simple 

00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:18.144
 These two blasts will correct propagation errors (positioning) 

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:20.653
 We are now, as we call it, in the space station phase 

00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:26.121
 And we will remain in the orbit of this phase until the international station is located in the appropriate place to be 

00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.879
 - Well, understand. If you're closer to the ground you're spinning around faster, right? 

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.589
 - That's true. 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.177
 - Well how long does it take you? The International Station takes 90 minutes to complete the Earth Cycle 

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:35.835
 - Once every 90 minutes 

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.536
 When it is just below 86 minutes 

00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:39.733
 You are a little faster 

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.480
 - Well, that's the goal of the orbit of the phase 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.931
 - Catch up with the international station 

00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:45.120
 - Well understand, this is the right time 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.812
 - This is the right time 

00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:47.007
 - Now we have made 4 blasts 

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:47.679
 - OK 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:48.544
 - but now 

00:07:48.544 --> 00:07:50.250
 - Well, we moved Humans 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.711
 - We moved Humans to enlarge our orbit 

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.823
 We made two more blasts to correct any displacement due to altitude 

00:07:54.823 --> 00:07:56.330
 - Now we are round the perfect stage 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.369
 - Perfectly positioned, in a perfect circular orbit where we want to be 

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:00.788
 Now we wait 

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:04.146
 When the space station is in the right place 

00:08:04.146 --> 00:08:05.438
 We'll be moving another homan, two nests 

00:08:05.438 --> 00:08:07.573
 And will put us in front of the international station 

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:09.233
 We will wait 

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:10.738
 And when we get completely in front of the space station 

00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.936
 We turn the vehicle back and make a third 

00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:14.994
 To put us perfectly in front of the international station 

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.190
 - Thus, you perform a U-turn (180 ° rotation) 

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:16.972
 - Yes we rotate U character 

00:08:16.972 --> 00:08:17.881
 You see it 

00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:18.977
 You see the earth is passing by you 

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:19.880
 And you are going back 

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.172
 Push the brakes slightly 

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:22.654
 It turns the spacecraft in the opposite direction 

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:23.721
 Towards the space station 

00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.460
 You are directly in front of the International Space Station 

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.209
 We wait a little and then we go 

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:30.313
 Very slowly, approaches, and we fly like any normal plane 

00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:31.412
 We continue to link 

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:34.281
 - Fine, well move on the axes X, Y, Z and spin around 

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:34.995
 - Completely 

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:38.665
 - This is great, how long it takes to connect (docking) 

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:39.720
 - Takes about half an hour 

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.839
 Of the time you are conducting the approach operations 

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.297
 We will approach very slowly very, and it takes half an hour to complete the binding process fully 

00:08:44.297 --> 00:08:45.138
 - Well it is 

00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:49.481
 - You can do it faster but when you have two heavy metal bodies moving at 17,500 mph 

00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.314
 Make sure that they are in touch nicely 

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:52.544
 - Let's sum it up 

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:56.905
 Take-off places you in the input orbit and then moves to a higher orbit 

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:59.752
 You make some corrections to put you in the orbit of the ideal phase 

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:01.969
 Where they are attached to the space station 

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.805
 Because you are orbiting the earth faster 

00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:06.343
 Enjoy your time waiting for the right moment 

00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:08.926
 And then you will have two more explosions to put you in front of the International Space Station 

00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:13.191
 A heart to the track and a brake pad, to be ready to connect to the space station 

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.848
 You now understand some of rocket science 

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:19.723
 (Music) (translated by Hayyan Daud @ hyyanato) 

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:25.395
 In fact, my goal from this video is to double the number of astronauts Scott Kelly on Ingrid 

00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:27.346
 Sending a lot of people to his Twitter account 

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:30.451
 Is a live scientific experiment on the International Space Station 

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:31.711
 So please check its accounts 

00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:33.061
 I will put the links in the video explanation 

00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.685
 I would be very grateful 

00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:36.744
 I'm Destiny, and you're smarter every day 

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.205
 have a good day 

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.492
 Well, we are now in the International Space Station 

00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:41.469
 Is here you link 

00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:47.506
 - Yes, this is the Russian section of the International Space Station, there is a more accurate model in Russia 

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:50.802
 But there is a component located here at the top of the space station 

00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:54.138
 Called MRM2, a Soyuz vehicle in which I will be traveling will be linked to it 

00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:57.622
 Other Soyuz compounds will be linked to other parts of the Russian section 

00:09:57.622 --> 00:09:58.940
 - Thank you very much Sir, I am grateful for your time 

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.364
 - Absolutely 

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:01.364
 - Your day, goodbye
