Hey it's me, Destin. So, um...

00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:05.912
We got a hairbrained idea and
we came to an art festival...

00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:08.333
It's not really an art festival,
it's a festival, here in Alabama.

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:11.181
We've made art with bullets
and tried to sell it.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.435
So this is what we've got.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.887
We've got a bunch of art
that we've made with uh...

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.217
With bullet impacts.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.055
And we tried to make the
manliest setup possible.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.550
I know it's a rainbow, but I
made it, which makes it manly.

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:27.663
[Bang]

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.401
[Bang]

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:32.914
[Bang]

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:37.705
[Bang]

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.014
Oh, that was sweet, dude.

00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:46.573
So so far we've had... how much success?

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:49.918
- Zero.
- Zero, but we're men.

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:52.619
- We're men.
- We also have a high speed camera.

00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:54.693
[Briley] We're introducing the
public to high speed video.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:56.735
Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:57.927 --> 00:00:59.261

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:05.012
(Destin) Alright. So what we do is we
just capture the image, or video of her

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.316
popping a balloon and what we're
going to do is go back and play it.

00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:09.698
It's kind of like a time
machine, only different, so...

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:11.566
Look at this, right here.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.520
[Music]

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:48.324
Captioning in different languages welcome.
Please contact Destin if you can help.
