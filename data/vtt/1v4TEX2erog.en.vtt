00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hi, I'm Dostono, welcome again in (the smartest every day) if you want to become 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
 In the smartest area, you have to talk to experts in this area for this reason I traveled to 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
 Germany and a man named JÃ¶rg Sparf spoke. Today we will learn about 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.030
 The physics of the slingshot work, but before we do that we enjoy dropping some goals 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.030
 You become smarter every day 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 Well today we are in a 300 year old farmhouse in a small village 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.080
 Well, Jorg, what are we going to do today? - We will see (Tobias) hitting some goals 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.090
 (Tobias) in fact is the holder of the current record 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
 As the strongest manual slingshot, it gets more than 100 joules 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 With this slingshot we will try to kill some German beer 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 We've done a little tower, I hope you get a good shot 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 Hey man! 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.220
 Yes, you did well 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.300
 Hey man. 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.340
 Dark red color I love it! - It's nasty, like a jumbo 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.370
 It's a big hit - it's already a dark red 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.530
 Wonderful man. We move the palm in the states 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.300
 Your mouth, Jorg, is beautiful 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.630
 Well, rubber is an interesting article. 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.640
 Well, that's our chart. If we want to add power to the system 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.660
 Meaning increasing the latent power in the slingshot tapes 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 We pull out the tapes, in its turn! But there is something 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.710
 The higher the clouds, the more difficult the clouds will be 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
 Let me show you how? If you take a look at the power scale, the more you pull the tapes 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.770
 The greater the difficulty. If you draw it graphically 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.790
 The latent energy on the vertical axis, the offset on the horizontal. When I pull 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.820
 Because clouds are getting harder, the relationship is not linear, but a curve function. 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 Well, there's something else. When a launch is launched and starts to accelerate 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.860
 To the outside towards the arm, we will get 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880
 Same as the previous curve indication and the characteristics of rubber material 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.890
 The interesting part is that if we add the value of the remaining potential 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.940
 In the rubber straps and kinetic energy in the moving conveyor Nagoya 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
 At any given point during displacement of the lever towards the arm it will equal 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.990
 Almost the energy that I added to the system in the end 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.010
 The last rubber property, I did not quite understand it until I saw one of the experiments (Jorg). When pulling the slingshot bars 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.030
 Back heats up, but if you let it cool 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.050
 You will lose some energy. This means that the total potential energy 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.080
 In the system shrink. That is, the extruder will become slower 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.080
 If I stood for a while I waited for the rubber cools. Why do you think that happens? 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 Well, would you like to explain that, Jorg? - Yes, shot (Tupia) standard. 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.100
 Made of steel, with a diameter of 20 mm. At 83 m / sec 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.820
 Ie 115 Gul. - Well, get ready. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.150
 He can do it 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.220
 Drag and launch directly without interruption 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.280
 It uses full rubber powers without it 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.290
 He loses any macroscopic potency by procrastination, which will happen otherwise 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.350
 Oh hell, how thick is it? 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.460
 Yup! 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 This is done with the missing cone, which happens when you distribute the spherical mortar on the surface of an object 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.390
 Well, here I have two types of rubber bands, fasteners on the clamps on the platform, and here in the straps you will see 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.400
 The tape on the left is tapered and less thick in the socket than the other on the right. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.420
 It is self-evident if Orana is shut down, 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.430
 You will guess that the one on the left will expand more than one to contain less substance 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.450
 To resist expansion 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 If we fired a shot with a tapered tape and another normal 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480
 It is assumed that on Yemen, the tape is tapered 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.530
 Will be fired the fastest faster true? This is not what happens at all 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.600
 This is known in the world of slingshot years ago, but no one has a clear explanation. 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.610
 What I and Jorg did, we filmed the ultra-high speed shooting (you) and we fired 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.620
 Two shots of different stickers, quickly filming amounted to 1000 pictures for the second. Which is on top 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640
 Is for the sprocket with the non-pointed tape. 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.660
 And it is obviously less accelerated than below 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.670
 My view is very simple. Each solid material has a so-called voltage curve and elongation (emotion) 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.690
 The voltage is the forces affecting the unit of the cross-sectional area 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.720
 (Emotion) is the percentage of elongation that is proportional when applied by forces. 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.730
 It is more likely to cause an energy overload than to cause stress to the system 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.750
 Well, the conclusion is that we went to two different continents, and I learned two things 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.770
 I will ask you two questions. The first thing I learned, that the energy latent in the rubber bands is reserved 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.800
 But it soon leaks in the form of heat 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.810
 The second thing is that the slings with pointed straps are more effective or efficient 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.830
 In converting the latent energy into kinetics. Well, this is extra information 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.880
 In 1660 a man named Robert Hawke discovered the law of flexibility 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.950
 Or the Hawk Act. There is something interesting. 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.970
 Rubber in rubber bands, do not obey the law of flexibility, I will leave a link 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.990
 In the details of the episode below, you can read more on this subject, but warn you some of your physics books may be wrong 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.000
 In any case these are the questions that I brought you, number one 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.010
 Why does rubber lose some of its (latent) energy when it cools? In other words, I can push a rubber band further away 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.050
 If you pull it out and release it directly and the second thing is why the slingshot with the rubber stripes is bigger than the efficiency 95 00: 05: 58,070 -&gt; 00: 06: 02,120 Help me know why this happens. I (Dosten), and thank you for your follow-up. 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.630
 Enjoy the backstage 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.150
 (Jorg) knows a lot, and I want to increase 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.170
 My superficial knowledge of elasticity and rubber. But before we delve deeper into physics 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.180
 Slingshot ... to set some goals. You've messed up this snapshot 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 With it I hit it. Blahlallah! We use less active material 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
 Let 's go. 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.230
 Go ahead 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.258
 ... Speaking of slingshot, I want to know ... 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.275
 Not again 

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:38.290
 When I first saw you 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.340
 I thought you were a little coward. I'm glad you're not 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.350
 I speak only like that because 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.370
 His hand hurts him and he can not hurt 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.390
 So I wanted to go deeper 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.990
 I'm killing myself here 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:03.440
 In fact the tapered deviates more. But interesting in the subject, that ... goat really! 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.460
 I want to know about the flexibility of. 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.470
 Aah! 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.490
 ... (Jorg Sparp) Today we will learn about the physics of slingshot but the physics of slingshot work, but before we do so 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.530
 So let's enjoy dropping some goals. You become smarter every day. 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.580
 I finally completed my script 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.080
 Since lightning is here. 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.463
