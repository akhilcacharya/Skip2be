00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.118
 Hi Ana Dustin. 

00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:02.856
 Welcome back to the smartest program every day. 

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:04.605
 You will not believe your eyes. 

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.801
 You've heard this before? 

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.218
 It's usually like clicking on a title tag to make you watch an online video 

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.555
 Or read a stupid article. 

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:14.660
 But are there situations when you really can not believe your eyes? 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 Make this video as big as you can on the screen 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.856
 And we will try. 

00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:23.707
 Place your head as close to the screen as you can not see the picture 

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:27.653
 It's a beacon over an island but I've turned colors. 

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:32.690
 I want you to focus your eyes on the top of the lighthouse and not move them 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.088
 Give up my brother 

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.639
 Mind this island off the coast of Tasmania. 

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.091
 [seagulls] 

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:50.406
 Well I'm about to reverse the picture again but I want you to keep focusing on the lighthouse. 

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.502
 are you ready? 

00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:52.093
 here we are. 

00:00:53.903 --> 00:01:00.976
 From the corner of your eye you can see a pale blue sky and a deep blue royal sea with little green grass patches on the island. 

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.336
 Now, take your eyes and move them to the edge of the island. 

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.738
 Do you see that? There is no color in this picture. 

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:09.184
 It's a black and white image. 

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:12.803
 Your mind just made up the color that was not there. 

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:14.328
 Do you believe your eyes? 

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.068
 By the way, just in case you are curious 

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:18.401
 This is what the original picture looked like. 

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.953
 Well, I just show you a black and white picture 

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:23.608
 And why your mind saw something like that. 

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:24.932
 what happens? 

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:26.934
 Is something going on with your eye? 

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.225
 Or your mind? 

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.364
 Because we all know that it may be the optic nerve that connects the two. 

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:32.634
 Let us continue the investigation a bit. 

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.312
 A few years ago I saw this video on the Internet 

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.861
 At first it looks just like a neat little light toy. 

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.069
 But my mind saw something in a different way. 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.006
 I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. 

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.012
 Not that I did not understand what was happening, 

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:50.795
 But I knew that what I was watching did not actually exist. 

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.958
 As soon as I watched this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this 

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.055
 He was a genius. 

00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:57.358
 The bad news is though, 

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.229
 Hundreds of miles live in the desert. 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.042
 So I'm in a kind of haggard hotel 

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.796
 Wah, I do not want to say hapless. 

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:08.149
 Have you ever seen someone do something really wonderful on the Internet 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.090
 And I wanted to meet them? 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.714
 Well this is kinda what happened here. 

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.545
 This is Greg. 

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:12.161
 - Welcome 

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.754
 - And Greg has a very interesting tool that you have made? 

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:15.680
 But what are we gonna call it? 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.210
 - That's what we gonna call it. the device. 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.703
 - Have you designed this PCB? 

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:19.374
 - I did. 

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.601
 - Do you fill it? 

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:21.378
 - I did. 

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:23.737
 Also there are many small chips out there, but .. 

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:24.898
 - You're a geek man. 

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:25.519
 - Yes I know. [Laugh] 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.267
 It gets easier. 

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.971
 - Since when did not take to fill the board? 

00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.362
 - It takes about an hour and a half. 

00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:33.764
 - Can you do it all in an hour and a half? 

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:34.340
 - Yeah. 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.732
 - Yes but you can change the water pump on the Chevrolet pickup 1990? 

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.086
 - [Laugh] 

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:39.989
 - So those are the bulbs right? 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.412
 - Yes they're red green RGB blue LEDs. 

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.673
 - that's cool. 

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:45.613
 Now how are you controlling it? 

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:49.849
 - Thus these lamps are mounted on the circuit board which mounted on the DC motor. 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.722
 If you apply the power to the DC motor, it spins. 

00:02:56.012 --> 00:03:01.285
 If my time is just right, I can basically light up any LED 

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.351
 Anywhere on the circuit that I want, as we can see here. 

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.328
 - So you created these bitmaps and then uploaded them 

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:08.984
 Through some of the programs you wrote? 

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:13.182
 - Yes, so this is a 63 bitmap by 63 pixels, 

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:16.540
 Basically I'm taking it and there actually is 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.094
 Infrared sensor on screen that can receive data. 

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:21.971
 - Oh look at it. 

00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:23.324
 Smarter every day. 

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:24.388
 A little greeting. 

00:03:24.388 --> 00:03:25.235
 How did you do that? 

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.431
 Did you carry it, or .. 

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:27.587
 You can do that day was not for you. 

00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.627
 - Yes in fact I just created that image 

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.191
 Right before being sent to meet you. 

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:33.193
 - This is amazing. 

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:34.877
 Ok so, here's the deal. 

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:37.564
 I asked you about this because I wanted to do it. 

00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:39.888
 I wanted to use this high speed camera 

00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:41.631
 Let's look at what you've got here. 

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:43.827
 This is the Phantom Miro we use here. 

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:47.708
 This is the Miro 320S, and we setup will work .. 

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.769
 What is the update rate on a microcontroller? 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.388
 - Or is it too fast. It's spinning in about 25 revolutions every second. 

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:59.399
 - Within that it updates 256 times. 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:04.700
 So we are looking at at a rate of 200 microseconds that the bulbs get updated. 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.458
 - OK Up to a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you tell me. 

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:09.059
 - No. 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.682
 - OK. 

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.296
 Well, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. 

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:13.954
 - OK. 

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.633
 - What do we call these? Are these pixels? 

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.195
 The reason it's not really like a box thing like cartesians, 

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.229
 It's kind of like a bracket .. 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.841
 - Right, it's kind of like a pixel arc. 

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.207
 - Well, what do we call it? 

00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:23.718
 - The arxel. 

00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:25.630
 - Arxel .. like that. We're gonna go with it. 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.643
 To what extent does the LED bar travel per person arxel as you call it? 

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.028
 - It's about a half degree. 

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:37.040
 - If it was only going 1-2 degrees, then why is my mind still felt that light 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.298
 All the time it's around? 

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:45.224
 For it is only one 360 ​​sweep, but keep it dark. 

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:46.610
 According to the high-speed camera, 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.381
 Which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, 

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.198
 This is what actually happens. 

00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:53.094
 check it out. 

00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:56.655
 Those are points, or arxels as Greg likes to call them 

00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:58.619
 Is a kind of flipping all over the place. 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.052
 Most of the image is dead space. 

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.439
 So why not your mind make that picture? 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.067
 To understand why the brain sees something is not there 

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:07.993
 I found a man who studies this kind of thing 

00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:12.034
 This is what published more than 130 different papers on similar topics. 

00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:15.813
 OK I am in very bad Skype contact with Dr. Stuart Anstis 

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:19.568
 Who is a genius at the University of California at San Diego 

00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:20.636
 And what does Dr. Anstis study? 

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:25.240
 [British University] I study visual perception, especially visual illusions 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.880
 Which tells us about the normal processes of vision, 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.330
 How the eyes send information to the brain. 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.371
 - that's cool. It is clear that your tone makes it very clear 

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:36.157
 You have to know exactly what you are talking about because I am 

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:38.606
 Expect nothing less than a person studying visual perception. 

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:45.049
 So I want to understand why my eyeball is witnessing something where I know there is no light. 

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:46.054
 Why do I see that? 

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:52.455
 - It is because of continuous vision, which means that the eye averages what you see during a short period of time. 

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:56.388
 It's similar to a camera where you have a long exposure time, 

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:58.946
 This will give you more light coming, 

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.055
 The sensitivity is greater, but you have a slower response. 

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:03.793
 So anything moving gets blurry out. 

00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:08.263
 - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated 

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:10.649
 So my eyes record that light is there? 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.001
 There must be a delay time there. 

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:12.943
 What is that? 

00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:16.176
 - that the time delay varies greatly, scale and ten times, 

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:19.313
 Anything 10-100 milliseconds. 

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:22.158
 - According to Dr. Anstis there are two things going on, 

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:22.897
 Let's look at it. 

00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:25.360
 Let us pretend that we have LED flashing 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.035
 We want to look at the brain response to that LED. 

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.072
 First of all said there is a delay, 

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:33.305
 So when the LED comes for the first time in our brain will not 

00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:37.048
 We immediately see the vision, and it will take some limited amount of time later. 

00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:41.221
 Second, the eye averages what you see during a short period of time. 

00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:42.288
 Think about it. 

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:46.717
 If we have a moving average, this means that our vision has a kind of inertia to it. 

00:06:46.717 --> 00:06:47.846
 It works like this. 

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:52.987
 Where the average comes along and is exposed to those LED flash, it starts to increase. 

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:56.666
 As the light says away, the moving medium starts to slope down the back. 

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.702
 Also comes the light again that starts to average to go up again, 

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:04.879
 Instead of having gaps that are completely dark, we have this nice tub at the bottom. 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:10.821
 So we have a continuous vision even though there is no light to see at that time. 

00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.577
 Let's look back at that photo by Mo Mo before with all the flashing bulbs. 

00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:19.460
 Now, let's add this average time of light and see what the picture looks like. 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.462
 check it out. 

00:07:24.462 --> 00:07:25.527
 How wonderful is that? 

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:27.663
 It looks exactly like what our eyes see. 

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.932
 At what rate you expect I will resign seeing a unified image 

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:36.483
 But would I start to see like a tail pull across the screen? 

00:07:36.483 --> 00:07:41.357
 - Well if the average revolution time is less than one then you're going to see the gap. 

00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:47.931
 But suppose as you say, the fan goes around at 1/25 of a second, that is 40 milliseconds. 

00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:02.877
 - Get it now. 

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:03.949
 Do you understand? 

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:04.666
 think about it. 

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:07.770
 Greg wheel rotates at 25 frames per second, 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.934
 This has to do with the moving average time of the human eye. 

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.690
 This is why this video is at least 25, 

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.459
 It's actually 30 frames per second. 

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:18.565
 If not, I would see flickering of the picture. 

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:22.159
 What seems like a shortage in our eyes 

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:27.224
 It is actually what pleases things and makes the world work smoothly for us. 

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.847
 that's awesome. 

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:31.757
 If people watch this video students in your class 

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:35.727
 What do you want them to know about Greg Wheel and Persistence? 

00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:41.355
 - [laughing] Well I would say that each system has got a limited time decision 

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:48.300
 The eye has an engineering problem trading time resolution against light sensitivity. 

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.703
 In fact they got the kind of handles inside which this relationship can be changed trade-off automatically. 

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:56.974
 The eye is in many ways much smarter than the camera. 

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:58.980
 It's a beautiful piece of engineering. 

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.722
 - Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time. 

00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:02.943
 - Thank you. 

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:05.953

 - Welcome. 

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.644
 - which actually happens to us on the certification of Linda. 

00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:17.911
 Linda is like every day smarter but on very technical subjects. 

00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.983
 Even in this particular case, after effects. 

00:09:19.983 --> 00:09:22.700
 I had no idea how to do it. 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.758
 Micah came along and helped me. 

00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:28.898
 Actually took a set of classes on Linda we found one together right? 

00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:29.419
 - That's true. 

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:30.160
 - And what was called? 

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.807
 - Echo. 

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:34.466
 - This was a tutorial that taught me that model persistence vision using After Effects. 

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.258
 But you can learn almost any topic you want. 

00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:41.112
 I've got Excel tutorials, Photoshop tutorials, even how to edit the video as I do with the premiere.

 Do you have a good idea. 

00:10:12.907 --> 00:10:16.726
 OK Is there any truth to the rumors that you have actually proposed using one of these? 

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:18.433
 - There is some truth. [Laugh] 

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:21.315
 As you even finished the project I said to myself, 

00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:25.256
 Hey it wants to be very cool if you might want to write letters here 

00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:28.490
 So I decided this is how I wanted to suggest. With my greetings translator Abdullah Fathi
