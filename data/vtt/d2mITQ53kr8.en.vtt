00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello, I'm in Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Well, last week 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.400
 I described the collective control of a helicopter, I described cyclical control 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.580
 of a helicopter, and I also described the system that controls the pair. 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.790
 But this week I'll mix everyone to describe something called a combination of collective / cyclical control. 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.980
 It's pretty cool, and it's basically just like all helicopter pilots want, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100
 including Carl in this case. The way I will describe it is preparing and 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.290
 Teaching a high-speed video of Carl turning the helicopter and flying down the valley. 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.490
 [rotor noise] You are practically focused, maybe a little less right here. 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 [rotor noise] 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.860
 [rotor noise] This will be good. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.220
 It's pretty interesting, because if you think it's necessary 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.390
 Use both the collective and the cyclical to turn around, put on top, and then return 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.490
 to use negative group. 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.630
 [music] 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 And then he balances it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 over there all the time with the cyclic. You can see that it does not use at any time 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.210
 one entry in particular. It is always a variation of the two. OK, yes yes 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.260
 You just did not understand what happened, I asked Carl to do something else for us. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.450
 I asked him to put the camera on the back of the helicopter by focusing on the cyclic platter, and then 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480
 fly normally, so you can see the combination of collective and cyclical control, but there are a couple of things that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.680
 you have to remember At the top of the screen you will see the rotors, and at some point it will look like that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.870
 They are bending. Actually this does not happen, what you see is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.050
 Something called a blind effect. The second thing you will see is that it seems 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.230
 the motor shaft accelerates and slows down a lot. This has to do with the pictures per second of the camera. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.410
 Is called aliasing If you want to know what aliases do, simply click on this square here 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.500
 I will explain it to you in more detail. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.690
 [electronic sounds of the servomotor] 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.040
 [music] 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.050
 [music] 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
 Okay, I received a pile of comments on these videos about a helicopter 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.090
 You can really do this type of maneuver. And the answer is yes, and no. 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.160
 Helicopters can do this if they are designed to do it, but the problem is that you are 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.330
 limited by this meat controller that is in the seat. A human can only receive a certain amount of acceleration. 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.370
 So, how extrapolate what you see in this helicopter radio control to a helicopter 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.410
 real? Before launching the space shuttle into space they had to do a wind tunnel test 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.460
 somehow, yes? Well, the thing is complicated, but there is something called similarity 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.500
 and the similarity has to do with the geometric resemblance, 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.670
 Kinetic and dynamic of a small object with an object 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.850
 real size Engineers do this at all hours, especially aerospace engineers. 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.040
 Anyway, go to the Wikipedia link that I will post below and read about the similarity 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.220
 so you can understand it. I'll tell you that. It has to do with the mechanics of the continuous media, 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.400
 that is by far the most difficult subject I have done in my life. So if you want to know it 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.570
 There is a city in Florida called Destin, and the store of savings for me is the place 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.760
 that's more spring on the planet. Anyway, the video next week will leave you perplexed. 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.910
 It's very complicated, but really interesting, so 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.080
 If you can understand this you are doing it pretty well, but it caught me very much. 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.260
 You will find a lot, too. Have a good time, and make yourself smarter every day.
