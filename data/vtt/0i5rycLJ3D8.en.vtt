00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.378
 Hi I'm Dustin 

00:00:01.378 --> 00:00:02.704
 Welcome back to the intelligence every day. 

00:00:02.704 --> 00:00:03.729
 Have you ever led 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.972
 And stop suddenly, and realize that you are moving 

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.393
 Around this world in the bubble of glass? 

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:09.841
 It's something weird if you think about it. 

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.036
 But this is really wonderful. 

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:13.432
 Glass engineers are designed in your car 

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.048
 Be very safe, so that when you have a wreck 

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.919
 You can reduce the chance of being hurt 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.701
 Divided into two halves like a wicked villain. 

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:20.807
 Remember ghost film? In any case. 

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:22.485
 Even today the day is all the smarter 

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.616
 I want to investigate two different types of glass 

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:25.874
 Which enter the windows of cars. 

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.625
 On the side you have a solid glass 

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.719
 Kind of like Robert Prince drop, but flat 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.241
 On the windshield you have a reinforced glass 

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.026
 First let's talk about the windshield. 

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:38.090
 The glass is designed on the windshield to take a hit from the rock and not fall into your lap. 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.997
 However, the glass on the side windows are different. 

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.037
 To prove this, I got a window from a car in the hardware 

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.424
 We gonna hit it and watch what happens. 

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.238
 Check out how to break it 

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:49.894
 Do not break 

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:52.637
 This is because it is designed to be very very strong in the middle 

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:53.991
 But not on the edge. 

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.839
 Watch what happens if we do not do the same thing on the edge. 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.382
 [Smashed] 

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.106
 Everything is broken. 

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.528
 To understand exactly why this happens 

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.662
 We will go away and use a high-speed camera 

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:08.893
 To analyze this at 20,000 frames per second. 

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.580
 What are you doing Mr. Assistant? 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.869
 - Holding the glass. 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.491
 - He held the glass. This is not a solid glass 

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.694
 I've got a high-speed camera, that's the V1610 

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.590
 And we have our pictures of this video as soon as possible 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.860
 High speed camera here 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.342
 I have another assistant over here. 

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:23.730
 Not you. 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.768
 What are you doing? 

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:28.167
 Pressing the button when the camera occurs .. 

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.684
 I mean when, mother .. 

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:31.387
 - The camera is not gonna break! [Laugh] 

00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:32.069
 - the glass. 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.628
 - When the glass breaks, and what does this? 

00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:35.110
 - Start the camera. 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.112
 - Right. OK. 

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.085
 That's what we're going to do 

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:39.185
 Not glass hard 

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.891
 We gonna show the difference between the two. 

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.737
 There is a special announcement at the end of this. 

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:44.889
 So, let's do some science. 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.001
 You can move friends. 

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.072
 - Can I move? 

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:50.170
 - I got it. Yes, wear safety glasses 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.920
 Are you ready, girl? 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.567
 Ready? 

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.077
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 

00:01:56.547 --> 00:01:57.935
 [Smashed] 

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:01.744
 [Laughing] Well, do you do it? 

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:08.859
 [Shatter slowed down] 

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.390
 OK, ready, my friend? 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.619
 mood. 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.337
 are you ready? 

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:21.724
 Do your best. 

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:24.149
 3..2.1.1. 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.661
 did you understand? 

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.071
 It was not broken. 

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.153
 He said that the glass did not break. 

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.572
 Down from the top this time. 

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:43.036
 Try dropping it from the angle as well. 

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.680
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.969
 Yahaa! 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.040
 It's not broken! 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.107
 Well, it is not broken so we will link this key to the bottom part 

00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:03.204
 Of glass. 

00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:07.279
 The idea is that perhaps this key will twist the edge 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.546
 Break the glass when it is affected 

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:11.449
 we will see. 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.773
 Hope it works. 

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.394
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.366
 [Smashed] 

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.239
 There we go. 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:40.246
 [Crush slowed down] 

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.824
 Well this is the post. 

00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:49.755
 You can see on our left tempered glass. 

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:52.016
 On the right, this glass is only solid steel 

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:54.371
 So the question is, why did they break differently? 

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.661
 It's great, is not it? 

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.733
 Well, what have we learned from this experience? 

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.153
 Solid glass is just ordinary glass and that's what it was 

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:03.940
 Its heat rose sharply in the manufacturing process and then allowed to cool down gradually. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.620
 This cooling relieves any internal pressure on the glass. 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.625
 You will notice when the glass is broken 

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:13.954
 Not only is it slowly broken but sometimes it may not break up to the other side of the glass. 

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.357
 Which is good for glass. 

00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:19.130
 A small crack in one spot of windshield does not completely block your vision. 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.520
 They also placed a piece of plastic between two solid glass panels 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.042
 As these large pieces do not fall and injure you inside the car 

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.826
 Tempered glass is very different. 

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.986
 Instead of allowing the glass to cool down slowly 

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:33.123
 They use forced air to cool the exterior sides of the glass quickly 

00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:35.419
 Leaving what is inside the hot glass. 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.168
 Kind of like the way Prince Robert is dropped if you remember this video. 

00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:40.013
 The inside is still hot until it cools 

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.172
 It shrinks and pulls and puts something outside the glass under pressure 

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:45.538
 But the inside of the big tug 

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:48.542
 Just like the Prince Robert drop if you can get through that solid outer layer 

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:52.610
 Reduces stress and flies in front of it destroys an entire layer of glass. 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.558
 On the Prince Robert drop you have to get through the outer curved surface 

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:57.100
 Of the drop to relieve tension 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.306
 But on the car window you have to get through the flat tempered surface to release the tension. 

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:04.092
 With a sheet of glass though, we have to start along one of the edges. 

00:05:04.092 --> 00:05:06.115
 Even after breaking the glass 

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:10.619
 Sometimes you can still hear tension releasing itself as it continues to break. 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:11.321
 So go there. 

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.453
 The next time you need to escape from the car window 

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:15.363
 Remember that the windshield is solidified 

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:16.626
 And it's gonna hold together 

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:18.721
 But the side windows were tempered and they would bust out of 

00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.666
 Just as long as you hit them on the ledge. 

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.052
 Well, I'll just go for that. 

00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:24.920
 You are smart and know how YouTube works. 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.607
 The company is approaching the person with a big channel 

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:30.170
 Say we can take care of the product on your channel 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.656
 And the man says yes, they agree to the price. 

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:33.946
 this is different. 

00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:36.428
 I actually contacted this company 

00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:38.504
 Because of the change of my family products 

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.698
 In a really good way, I want to happen to your family. 

00:05:41.698 --> 00:05:43.318
 He called the kiwi cage. 

00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:46.488
 Last Christmas I wanted to get a gift for my kids that would help 

00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:47.688
 I have to spend more time with them. 

00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.370
 Now I live in hotels for two and a half weeks, 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.018
 I want to spend time with my children now. 

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:56.996
 Every month a kiwi cage appears at home for both kids. 

00:05:56.996 --> 00:06:01.099
 My son has a tampering cage, which is like a science and engineering group. 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.685
 This is the catapult he gets to build, cut the laser plywood. 

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.912
 This is my daughter. It's called Doodle Crate. 

00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.630
 She gets to do an art project every month. 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.564
 She made a paper. We did it together. 

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:12.217
 My youngest son gets another one. 

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:13.441
 This one is on transport. 

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:15.190
 This is called a koala cage. 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.451
 It's a little thing for his age group. 

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.493
 But every month they get all the box and they know 

00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:23.468
 That frame is something they get in touch with the father. 

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:25.440
 So, I really want you to do this. 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.247
 If you know a kid and want to child to 

00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.507
 You know, just have their mind stimulated 

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:31.613
 In many different ways. 

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:35.619
 Please consider going to kiwicrate.com/smarter 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.424
 Get a subscription for that child. 

00:06:37.424 --> 00:06:39.040
 Because I approached the kiwi cage 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.117
 The first kiwi crate or tamper crate you get for free. 

00:06:43.117 --> 00:06:45.803
 If you do not like it, just cancel and never pay anything. 

00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:47.029
 I know you gonna keep it 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.966
 Because we do it and our family likes it. 

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:51.936
 It's a fun time I get to be with my kids 

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.433
 And I, that's all I want now. 

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:56.565
 So, if you are interested in supporting the smartest every day, 

00:06:56.565 --> 00:07:00.085
 Spend time in your children's mind, 

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.810
 Give her a chance. I sell it hard, I really do. 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.840
 I know I sell hard, 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.707
 The reason is, I believe in it. 

00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:06.645
 Here you are. 

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:08.138
 I hope to enjoy this video.

 If not, I'm Dustin. 

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:12.885
 You get smarter every day. 

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:13.858
 I have a good idea. 

00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:14.890
 This is fantastic is not it. 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.097
 I want to say thank you to a really wonderful security guard 

00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:21.103
 Which decided not to stop me. 

00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:21.871
 Thank you so much. 

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:22.614
 what's your name? 

00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:23.095
 - Tony. 

00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.918
 - Tony. Tony has common sense and he's gorgeous. 

00:07:25.918 --> 00:07:27.519
 I really appreciate this. 

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:30.495
 kiwicrate.com/smarter. The first episode in the description. Good-bye.
