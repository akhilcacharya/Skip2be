00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.530
 [music] 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.040
 OK, because we are about to show 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
 the Dragon's Breath cartridges, the last one in stoves, and we have 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.080
 the most virile person we know, in John, to do it. John, can you hear us? - If 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.410
 - Are you ready? - Ready 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.120
 3..2..1 .. [explosion] [laughter] 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 [music] 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.410
 What happens if you need a fire? 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.350
 [blast] [laughter] 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 Fantastic! 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.750
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. Fire 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 - The mother of the guy. - This is awesome. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 Aah, that's the firing right there. 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.840
 Look at this. - Oh, nano. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.050
 3..2..1 ... 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.140
 OK, men's time playing with fire is over. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 It's up to you to become smarter every day. So I got a document 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
 Made by the Department of Energy of the United States in 1984, which speaks of pyrophoricity 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
 of Zircaloy zirconia. This is important because that is what you use 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
 to Dragon's Breath cartridges. This is a different hair from the usual ammunition of the flares, which he uses 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.210
 Magnesium or phosphorus if you are American, or bari salts if you are Chinese 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.270
 or Russian. So this document really reveals 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.290
 how to swing the zirconium Right down here on the page 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.310
 19, there is a graph that shows how the ignition temperature 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.320
 in degrees centigrade is a logarithmic function of the specific area, 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 which is the outer surface of the zirconium particle 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.380
 in relation to its mass. So, basically, as the particle 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 It gets smaller, it gets much easier at the ignition temperature. 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.440
 So you can see here that it is inversely proportional. 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.460
 Well, and why do we care about that? Well, it's just interesting. 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.480
 Another thing that is interesting about zirconium is, well, in the periodic table it is 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.490
 It is a bit like hafni here, it looks like some of the features. 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.540
 Something that is clear about the zirconium is that it happens completely 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.550
 of neutrons The neutrons cross it through the right, and practically does not absorb, 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.570
 which makes it very interesting for the nuclear industry. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.630
 He also reacts very little about what he does 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.650
 to corrosives, so it is used as a container for fuels 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.690
 of nuclear reactors. The reason is that the neutrons go through and what 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.740
 the energy is not absorbed. This is interesting until 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 You have an accident like Fukushima, and when you start at 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.790
 increase the temperature, as we have seen in that table before, 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.800
 you start to have some reactions. How can you see it here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.840
 One of the secondary products of the reaction is hydrogen, 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.850
 often gas. This is what happened in Fukushima. Hydrogen gas was created 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.880
 When the zirconium began to warm up, and to react, and that 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.880
 is what detonated. This detonated and caused all kinds 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.910
 of problems Anyway, now you are smarter every day 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.000
 and if you would like to help me, I would appreciate it if you would like to pass this on to some of your intelligent colleagues 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.030
 or people who like guns, and see if you can help me get some 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.070
 subscribers I would really appreciate it. Spend a good day. Bye.
