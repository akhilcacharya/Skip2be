00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:06.535
 Well the time of the story 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.480
 Almost 15 years ago I was about to get married 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.940
 I was at the wedding ceremony and wore the suit looked at me and my father said 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.280
 Build whatever your wife is preparing to eat 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.960
 Let him eat and ask for more 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 Without asking questions (without comment) 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.740
 Well something strange has happened 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.120
 I lived in a small town after marriage and did not have much money 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.540
 We had to save as much as possible 

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.315
 By buying from the Bent and Dent store (a shop that sells canned and battered food) 

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:37.455
 This is the store we were buying from 

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.425
 One day my wife thought 

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.815
 It would be a good idea to provide in a particular commodity 

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.975
 Of the unusual goods they provide 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.420
 And 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.080
 It was a sensitive point in our marriage 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.080
 Let's see if they're still available 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.180
 Here we are with sauces 

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:05.005
 It's in this hallway 

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:07.915
 I have to say 

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:10.655
 The quality of this store has 

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:13.265
 Has improved significantly 

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.040
 They have been selling a good commodity these days (compared to what was sold in defective goods) 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.665
 Look at the addition of floor 

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:20.525
 Here we are 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100
 Sloppy Joe (a kind of sauces for sandwiches made from chopped meat, onions and ketchup) 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.620
 there she is 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.340
 this is 

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:29.895
 It was an arthropod in my marriage 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.000
 And if I bring it to my wife 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.220
 You will know immediately what I mean 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 what are you doing? 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.440
 I cook in our kitchen 

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:43.235
 Well I brought something so well 

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.615
 I want to see your opinion in it 

00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:47.840
 Well, you know where to shop 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.540
 Yeah 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.800
 Well, I know where you shop 

00:01:52.075 --> 00:01:54.135
 Please say - what is it - 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 It's the most horrible meal 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.100
 I attended her in my life 

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.215
 Would you like to explain the story? 

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:05.555
 AA 

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.125
 OK 

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:08.845
 When the beginning of our marriage 

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.125
 We did not have much money and I was shopping 

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:14.825
 Bambent &amp; Dent 

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:16.395
 Grocery Store 

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:20.295
 On the night she attended Sloppy Joe 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.380
 Not with this brand 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 But in a box without a damaged brand 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.660
 I attended and took a bite 

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.125
 And the first one I took 

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:36.795
 I stood up from the table 

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.775
 I threw the whole sandwich and refused to eat it 

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.795
 Even though I am from his cook 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.700
 And you are on the other hand 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.360
 I ate sandwiches and asked for more 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.440
 Lest they cook again 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.900
 What this has on our marriage 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.360
 We are married for 15 years now 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.280
 Cook dinner 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.420
 Well Well 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.800
 So did this thing tell me? 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.260
 Yes, I have given you very much 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.120
 OK 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.080
 So young men, young people 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.720
 If you cook your partner 

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:12.440
 All ask for more 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.700
 Even if it was tasteless 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.920
 And she threw herself 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.280
 Smartest every day (channel name) 

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.865
 I thought Enki would love him 

00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:22.360
 This is very fun 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.920
 Did you find it difficult to find? Yup 

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:27.765
 By the way the store has changed 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.480
 From any hand it changes as it contains quality goods now 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.975
 Oh he had been professionally canned only damaged 

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:38.480
 Yes, it's great now what's this? 

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.175
 It is chicken with parmesan cheese 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.960
 Lovely and grilled potatoes 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.480
 That's what I'm talking about 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.265
 There is a spinach salad here 

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:51.260
 I got it 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 And I have 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.460
 I added .... fresh and some corn and cheese 

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:00.035
 That sounds good to me 

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.775
 O Lord, these potatoes are delicious 

00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:06.235
 She improved cooking now 

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:08.325
 And also more healthy 

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:12.025
 This place has changed yes 

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:15.455
 How do you change? I mean, it was not that good 

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.005
 The products also improved is not it? 

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:20.665
 I hope so I think so
