Two bottles: one's liquid, one's solid.

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.376
The question is, if they roll each

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.776

[Destin laughs]

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.975
I just want to make my video, alright?
[Laughs]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.571
Really.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.320

Over here you've got losses due to
fluids here you've gotta worry about.

The water's actually going to heat up.

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:48.377
Pick now, on these two boxes, and if you
get it wrong you have to subscribe.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.148
