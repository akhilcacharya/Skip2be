[Music]

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:07.374
Hey it's me, Destin.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.603
So uh, welcome to my 4th of July tradition.

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:12.737
It's something I do every year. I'm
out here on the Bickering Nag,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.127
alone, this year.

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:15.682
Everybody else had something they had to do

00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:17.350
because the firework show is late.

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.613
But anyway, I'm just gonna kind
of take you into my tradition,

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:20.822
show you what I do.

00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:22.360
We always try to stay close to the bank,

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.461
because we don't want to get
near the motorized vehicles.

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.716
This is kind of weird; makes you
think the Booger's gonna get you.

00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:29.094
But anyway, um... So
what we do is we set up

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.990
opposite from the firework
show, on the river.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.860
I take time-lapse, open
shutter photography,

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:38.426
and I've always been notoriously
bad at chemistry. Like, real bad.

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:42.171
So this year I decided I was
going to learn the chemicals

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:44.283
and the different colors that
they make for fireworks.

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:46.872
so I researched it a little bit, so I'm
going to run through that with you.

00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:50.895
These are, uh... not pure
elements that we're burning here.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.539
These are compounds created with these
elements, so keep that in mind.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:57.268
Red is strontium.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:01.096
Orange is calcium. Calcium salts, usually.

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:04.948
Uh, electric white's like magnesium
or aluminium, or something like that.

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:06.342
Um...

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:10.708
Blue, that was a pretty good one.
Blue is usually copper.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.631
Green is barium.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.914
Yellow is sodium compounds.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.483
Gold is some type of iron, usually
with some kind of potash,

00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:23.438
or some kind of carbon in it.

00:01:23.463 --> 00:01:25.992
Purple is a combination
of strontium and copper,

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:27.828
so you get the red and
the blue going together.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:31.275

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.400
But anyway, I hope you enjoyed my pictures.

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:42.483
I hope you think it's pretty cool.
I really like it. It's uh...

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.296
one of my favorite traditions,
and I do it every year.

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.910
Unfortunately, the kids
had to go to bed early

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:52.048
because this year the
firework show was too late.

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:54.665
They really enjoy this. It's
one of their favorite things,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.776
and I miss my wife out here
with me this year as well.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.908
But anyway, you are getting
smarter every day,

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.808
and tell your friends.
Have a good one. Bye.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.916

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:21.047
...and where your relative motion is
going, so you can compensate for it.

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:23.070
Well, chickens are really
good at this, so...

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:27.606
I'll show you. Watch his
head stay totally stationary

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:33.080
as I move his body. I can move his
body in pretty much any direction.

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:36.712
Captioning in different languages welcome.
Please contact Destin if you can help.
