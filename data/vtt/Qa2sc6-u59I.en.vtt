00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.340
 Hi, I'm Destin 

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.792
 welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:03.985
 This is my column drill. 

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:07.676
 Of all things that people could send to Mars 

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:09.105
 on a nuclear-powered robot, 

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.593
 a drill was one of the most important things we sent. 

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:13.658
 And the reason we did this, 

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:14.506
 think about this. 

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:17.240
 This is the block and you have seen tree rings right? 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.091
 If we drill in this block, 

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.813
 and then analyze the curls coming out of that hole, 

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:27.921
 because of the growth rings we could go back in time and understand 

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.441
 what all happened in this block when the tree was younger, right? 

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.252
 That is exactly why they sent a drill to Mars. 

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.444
 We want to understand if there were organic molecules 

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.579
 in the rocks of Mars when they were formed. 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.363
 But to do that you have to drill under the surface 

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:45.082
 and then analyze the powder. 

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.630
 But every article I've ever read about the drill 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.208
 and how they analyze the powder 

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.243
 does not really satisfy me. 

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:52.805
 So today at Smarter Every Day 

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:53.932
 Am I with JPL. 

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:55.908
 This is Mark Rober .. Crazy! 

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:58.264
 He's going to give me a tour of what? 

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:00.545
 - Uh okay. 

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:01.290
 - You missed your signal. 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.998
 - Sorry. [laughs] 

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:03.171
 - We have to start over again, he missed his signal. 

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:04.357
 - I just realized .. 

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.619
 - This is my buddy Mark. 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.592
 Do you remember all those beautiful rocket movies where we 

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.262
 the Curiosity Rover dropped to the surface of Mars 

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.047
 with these beautiful rocket cranes? 

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.541
 Yes, he helped to work on that. 

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.392
 But more importantly, he owes me a bit more 

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:18.906
 so I asked him if he could introduce me to the 

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.485
 people behind the drill on the robber. 

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.460
 I wanted to understand exactly how this thing works. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.562
 - So we're going to the Mars yard, 

00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:28.310
 which is in fact a simulation of the surface of Mars. 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.181
 - Yes, look at both sides before crossing the street to Mars. 

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.255
 - Looks .. Mars! 

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.294
 - So this is the Curiosity garage? 

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:39.909
 - Yes, so they bring it out here in the garden 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.112
 You can see the tracks here. 

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:44.538
 But then when they only work on something inside 

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:45.889
 they bring it back into the barn. 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.471
 - Wow. Oh man so this is the only one? 

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.285
 Is this one of a kind? 

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:50.381
 - It's one of a kind. 

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.970
 The only one on the planet earth. 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.838
 - I think it's two of a kind. 

00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:55.161
 I am Destin, what is your name? 

00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:56.196
 Megan. 

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:57.677
 - Can I shake your hand from here? 

00:01:57.677 --> 00:01:59.107
 Nice to meet you Megan. 

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:00.079
 You run the test? 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.720
 - I'm turning it now, yes. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.072
 - That's pretty great. 

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:04.665
 He did not let you talk, 

00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:06.795
 but I want to talk to you, but there is a robber between us. 

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.127
 This duplicate of the Curiosity rover exists 

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.484
 allowing scientists and engineers software 

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:14.712
 and can test difficult maneuvers without risking damage 

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:16.523
 to the real hardware. 

00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.435
 Okay, we decided to stop rummaging 

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:20.665
 and Megan is going to tell us what the instruments are. 

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:21.794
 You know all the instruments right? 

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:24.995
 - I know a lot about the drill and the Chimra because I tested them. 

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:25.742
 - Yes? 

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:28.660
 - So this is kind of the end of the drill here. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.775
 - Can I walk there? 

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.035
 - You can come here. 

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.672
 - I will. So you slipped on it, right? 

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:33.808
 - I slipped it. 

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:35.619
 - To the earth, okay. 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.039
 - And so this what you see here 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.881
 we call Chimra, 

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.569
 I have no idea what that acronym is. 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.920
 - Actually, it's the instrument belt? 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.832
 - This is the sample processing. 

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:46.903
 - Okay, I really have to apologize now, 

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:49.070
 because I started to become so enthusiastic 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.904
 because I was in the room with the robber, 

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.103
 that I forgot that I was making a YouTube video. 

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:54.883
 And I started asking questions and they were 

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.859
 great questions, and then they let me do an assignment 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.701
 on the mast, and I moved it around. 

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:01.124
 It was incredible. 

00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:03.222
 Anyway, I went back and I tried to summarize it 

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.105
 everything I learned while I was offline in this recording. 

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:07.001
 I'm very sorry. 

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.881
 This is therefore the most important mast, the RSM. 

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.104
 That stands for what? 

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:12.758
 - Remote Sensing Mast. 

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.957
 - Okay and there are two sensors on the side here 

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:16.566
 and these are both for the weather. 

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.611
 One of them on Mars is not working right now. 

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:22.038
 Because it did not work at the landing anyway? 

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:26.164
 Okay so this is the arm here that is used to 

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.791
 collecting monsters on Mars, 

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.467
 and uses Megan's drill, anyway, 

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:32.117
 - The official name. 

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:34.860
 - The official name. So that's the drill, 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.439
 and it must have enough life to live up to our primary 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.675
 targets on Mars, and after that does not go well for whatever reason 

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:43.763
 if you want some whipped cream on the cake then you have 

00:03:43.763 --> 00:03:45.643
 two extra drills down here that you 

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:47.394
 can switch autonomously. 

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:47.970
 - Correct. 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.910
 - And that would be the first time ever that was done on another planet. 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.975
 And it's going to happen because you worked on it anyway? 

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.336
 - I want it to happen. 

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:54.589
 It would be really great to see. 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.990
 - Excellent. So here, 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.410
 looking at the monsters. 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.422
 So before we decide which samples we are going to analyze by doing them in this little hole here 

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:04.109
 can we put the samples on the plate, 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.044
 we can measure their size, both by the surfaces there on the checkerboard 

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:10.978
 or by dropping it through that funnel right? 

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:11.536
 - Right. 

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:12.664
 - And if we do that, 

00:04:12.664 --> 00:04:15.416
 we can, if it meets the criteria, we can 

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.345
 do it and analyze it in this hole. 

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.671
 And after analyzing it you dump it overboard. 

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:20.373
 - Yeah. 

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:21.109
 - Am I correct? 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:21.730
 - Yeah. 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.576
 - You are a good teacher. 

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:23.701
 Megan is clearly a genius, 

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.856
 but there were still a few questions that I had. 

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:28.405
 I wanted to understand the exact interaction 

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.859
 between drill and rock. 

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.672
 That's why I came to see Ryan. 

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:33.619
 What is your title? 

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.104
 - Drill system engineer. 

00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:36.394
 - So what is this here? 

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:37.064
 What do you have? 

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:38.369
 - This is a drilling assembly. 

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:39.174
 - OK. 

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:42.082
 - This is not just our drill, 

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.079
 that, if you look closely, this is a stone drill, 

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:47.992
 it is not like the sharp bits you have on 

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:50.485
 your hand drill. 

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:54.168
 It is more of a chisel and it is designed for impact drilling. 

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:55.978
 - OK. So how does it work? 

00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:57.856
 - So first we put our drill, 

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.501
 we put our drill stabilizers against the rock 

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:03.348
 to ensure that we have a nice stable configuration. 

00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:05.771
 Then we drop down until we hit the rock. 

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.407
 - OK. 

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:10.654
 - We start drilling with a process called begingat. 

00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:16.011
 So if you can imagine, if we are on a rock and not perfectly aligned 

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:17.985
 and there are all these surface properties, 

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.337
 little holes on the rock, 

00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:21.086
 the drill wants to walk around 

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:23.062
 Imagine if you were trying to cut metal 

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:26.103
 usually you put a small pilot hole before you start drilling. 

00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:27.934
 - Not to break the drill, 

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:29.939
 Is that the same reason you do that here? 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.754
 - Yes, so we have a process called begingat 

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:36.599
 it starts the first 5 mm of our hole 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.933
 and actually what we do is chisel small holes to carve out an asterisk shape. 

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:47.092
 [hammer drill sound] 

00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.615
 Then we drill that out and we repeat that process 

00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:54.752
 as often as necessary to go 5 mm deep. 

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:57.665
 Then we have a good starting point for the rest of our drilling. 

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.863
 [hammer drill sound] 

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:03.190
 It is not the rotation that really cuts the rock 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.770
 it is really the hammering action. 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.493
 [hammer drill] 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.633
 Like a jackhammer and then the rotation that we do is mainly 

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:16.309
 for getting the powder through the sheath. 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.637
 We continuously drill until we remove the drill. 

00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:22.518
 We literally punch the front of it 

00:06:22.518 --> 00:06:24.225
 drill set against the rock. 

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:27.912
 Before we drill we do a trial, 

00:06:27.912 --> 00:06:31.563
 We drill a little bit, so we can see what the powder will look like 

00:06:31.563 --> 00:06:34.025
 because we are concerned about or as it turns out 

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:37.929
 that this material is hydrated and it 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:43.360
 somewhat sticky, it can clog our drilling assembly. 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.232
 - Is it, on Mars? 

00:06:44.232 --> 00:06:46.912
 - It is possible, and that is one of the interesting things 

00:06:46.912 --> 00:06:52.480
 scientific findings recently is that there is a water cycle, 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.770
 an active water cycle near the surface of Mars 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.224
 even at Gale Krater. 

00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:59.202
 - Do you have one of the drills outside the drill head? 

00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:02.526
 - Not with me here, but I can show you one on my desk 

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:05.424
 if you are interested in what that looks like. 

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:09.663
 I have a 3D printed model of this where the drill itself is made of metal, but the rest 

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.480
 the housing is transparent plastic, so you can see through it. 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.026
 - Wow, can we do that? 

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:14.674
 - Yes. 

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:18.814
 - So what you're drilling, you're swallowing the material in here anyway, 

00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:19.594
 this housing? 

00:07:19.594 --> 00:07:23.206
 - Exactly. Yes in the first of our two chambers in the drilling assembly. 

00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:27.382
 So we have two rooms in the drill assembly specifically 

00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:31.196
 so it gives us some freedom to the robot arm 

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:34.971
 move around without worrying about spilling 

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.144
 material through the exit tube before we are finished 

00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:39.208
 to transfer it. 

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:43.210
 So once we get it in the first room it is in that first room 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.935
 until we transfer it through this little slot that you can see here. 

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:48.542
 - Yes. 

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:51.423
 - So we transfer it through that slot. 

00:07:51.423 --> 00:07:53.362
 We use percussion to shake things up 

00:07:53.362 --> 00:07:57.407
 and we use gravity to determine which direction the stuff goes. 

00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:59.109
 - So that's the mass flow that you were talking about. 

00:07:59.109 --> 00:07:59.627
 - Yes. 

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:01.424
 - Can I pretend to be the robotic arm for a second? 

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:01.873
 - Please. 

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:05.457
 - Yes, okay so you've got that slot, 

00:08:05.457 --> 00:08:08.009
 and so you want to keep that slot down 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.047
 so you want to start drilling, 

00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:12.208
 and then you pick it up and as long as that slot to 

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.248
 above is you holding all your sample particles? 

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:14.738
 - That's right. 

00:08:14.738 --> 00:08:16.252
 - Okay and so on that point 

00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:18.354
 when you have it where you have to go then you can 

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:21.285
 turning it and then you dump it through that little slit there 

00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:22.546
 in the next room? 

00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:23.389
 No wait back this way right? 

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:24.136
 - That's right. 

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.233
 - Okay, so you kind of .. 

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:26.461
 - Through the slot to the second room. 

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.628
 - Slips almost, almost in your hand like this, right? 

00:08:28.628 --> 00:08:31.507
 No, you turn again and it goes out of that opening. 

00:08:31.507 --> 00:08:32.517
 - That's right. 

00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:39.574
 Gravity operations by the Robot Arm and the vibrations generated by the Drill mechanism are used to transfer the sample to the CHIMRA. 

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:47.344
 - Okay, so we've drilled our rock and now we've got the powder 

00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:48.601
 on the inside of the rock. 

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:52.348
 In a very specific circumstance when you find a special rock 

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.749
 and you think you even have organic molecules 

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:57.490
 on the inside of that rock, you have to calibrate your instruments. 

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.699
 To do this, JPL was pretty smart. 

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:02.345
 They put these cans on the front of the rover 

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:04.831
 that are only used in certain circumstances. 

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.026
 I let Megan explain what they are for. 

00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:09.708
 So what is called OCM in these cans 

00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.559
 What is Organic Control Material? 

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.424
 - Yeah that's right. 

00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:15.143
 - Okay and so the idea is that you have a known monster that you can test 

00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:19.560
 on Mars, so you can ensure that your sensors work correctly. 

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.529
 - Right. 

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:24.209
 - And that is basically the same as the color palette there 

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.950
 so you can check that your cameras work correctly, 

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.636
 This is the same for your sensors 

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.183
 to see if there is life on Mars. 

00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:33.254
 - Right, for the instruments. For whatever scientific instrument they want. 

00:09:33.254 --> 00:09:34.482
 - So you say that's organic, 

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:36.358
 so are those pieces that were alive? 

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:38.332
 - If you are looking for organic substances on Mars 

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:40.017
 and you think you found it 

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.597
 you want to forward something that does not contain organic substances 

00:09:42.597 --> 00:09:44.669
 and analyze and make sure you do not see it, 

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.738
 and again test the thing that has organic substances. 

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:48.221
 - Ohh. So what you say is, 

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:51.578
 An Organic Control Material is basically just like 

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:54.236
 eating a cräcker what the peculiar wine tasting boys do, 

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.620
 - For cleaning the .. 

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.978
 - To clean the palate. 

00:09:56.978 --> 00:09:59.602
 Come on my level here. [laughs] 

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.084
 So that's what that is. 

00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:04.289
 This is actually a number of cräckers that you eat 

00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:07.452
 between your monsters to make sure you know what's going on. 

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:08.087
 Excellent. 

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:10.324
 The next time you see a perfect borehole 

00:10:10.324 --> 00:10:11.387
 in the surface of Mars, 

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:13.370
 do not think about it, you know, a column drill 

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.589
 or a percussion drill. 

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:17.535
 Think of a carefully executed group of maneuvers 

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.534
 specially designed to obtain dust. 

00:10:19.534 --> 00:10:20.539
 It goes like this. 

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:22.704
 You put the drill in, 

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:24.327
 you take out the drill. 

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:26.259
 You put the drill in, 

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.357
 and you get the dust out completely. 

00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:31.844
 You do the mass transfer by turning CHIMRA over, 

00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:35.566
 and that's how you dump the dust out. 

00:10:35.566 --> 00:10:38.673
 I've just ruined the Hokey Pokey for the rest of your life. 

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:41.415
 Gladly done, and I invented that and it's great. 

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:42.640
 YES! 

00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.658
 I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, 

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:46.492
 it was offered to you by audible.com. 

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.846
 Audible as you know is really a cool way 

00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.238
 where you can listen to audiobooks on your phone. 

00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:53.371
 Yes you are smart people, you know where this is going. 

00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:56.507
 This is my audible.com library and here at the top of the list, 

00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:57.832
 yep you guessed it, 

00:10:57.832 --> 00:10:59.803
 The Martian by Andy Weir. 

00:10:59.803 --> 00:11:00.963
 I know there's a movie out, 

00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:02.639
 but if you have not experienced the book 

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.133
 you really have to do that. 

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:06.065
 You can get any audiobook you want for free 

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.527
 at audible.com/smarter. 

00:11:07.527 --> 00:11:10.363
 I recommend The Martian, because there is much more science in the book 

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.431
 then that there was in the movie you probably already watched. 

00:11:12.431 --> 00:11:15.534
 if you sit here watching a ten minute video about drilling on Mars. 

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:17.094
 Anyway, I am Destin. 

00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:20.092
 Thank you so much for even considering viewing 

00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:21.905
 ten minutes of video on the internet. 

00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:23.002
 I know that's a long time. 

00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.712
 Anyway, please consider subscribing if this has added value to your life. 

00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:27.458
 Please consider supporting the sponsor. 

00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:28.557
 If not, nothing bad. 

00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:30.532
 I appreciate you. 

00:11:30.532 --> 00:11:31.280
 I'm Destin, 

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.412
 you become Smarter Every Day. 

00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:34.181
 Another good one. Bye. 

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:42.662
 It crosses borders. [Whispers] It crosses borders. Does it go beyond the limits to ask if I can high-fade the rover? 

00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:46.148
 - Umm ... you can not do that by ESD. 

00:11:46.148 --> 00:11:47.962
 - Can I .. Okay you're grounded right? 

00:11:47.962 --> 00:11:49.251
 - So I grounded. We have.. 

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:53.488
 - Can I high-fiven you, that's like the rover high-fiven 

00:11:53.488 --> 00:11:55.129
 Because you are at the same electrical potential. 

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.070
 Can we do this? 

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.232
 No? 

00:11:59.232 --> 00:12:01.174
 - That is such a strange question. 

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.502
 [laughs] 

00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:03.979
 - Yes! 

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:08.695
 [whispers] Megan we are like friends now. It took about 20 minutes. We are best friends. 

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.384
 She is about to give me an assignment.
