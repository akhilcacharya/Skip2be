00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.120
 Welcome, I'm Dustin, welcome again in smarter every day 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.500
 Sometimes in your life 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.800
 When you see Shi 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.000
 She asks and says this is impossible 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.500
 This is the case in this video 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.400
 Today we will take a look at the invention of Nikola Tesla 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.520
 But it looks like a video game 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.760
 But I assure you that this video is real 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.520
 But before that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.440
 Let's take a look at some of his contributions to the community when he emigrated to the United States in 1880 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.460
 If you search for patents Nicolas Tesla will be astounded 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.140
 Everything exists 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.400
 Pumps, Routers, Power distributors, Balance household 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 Remote energy 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.520
 The most important invention of them: engines 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.040
 Tesla devised a multi-phase AC generator system 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 Who initially proved that he could work at the Ames power station in Colorado 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.000
 This led to Tesla's cooperation with George Westinghouse (a businessman and an American engineer) 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.100
 To build the first large-scale power plant 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.440
 Niagara Falls 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.760
 This has been great. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.500
 If you have not seen it yet, there is a beautiful theme for Tesla 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 Overlooks the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.300
 The part I like about the stereotype is the story of how it came with the idea of ​​AC 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.200
 He was walking in the park B Budapest (the capital of Hungary) with a friend 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.800
 Suddenly, with a flash of lightning, the idea of ​​the rotary magnetic field came to mind 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.800
 Speaking of lightning 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 Tesla has had great experiences with high-voltage electricity 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900
 Colorado Springs area 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.520
 One of these experiments was performed using this circuit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.200
 There is an energy source that ships heavily 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.360
 When the condenser is full 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 SPARK GAP 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 Which takes the power to an initial file 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.580
 The secondary file is played with the same resonance frequency 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.000
 And then strengthen the tension and Hantm you get: 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.040
 Lightning 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 There is a company called one tesla 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.200
 And that make pieces to install Tesla file yourself 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 Which you can buy and install in full 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.700
 Yourself if you are proficient in how to weld 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.300
 My friend Philip works at 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.500
 Nuclear plant, as long as we deal 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.900
 With the high tension, his call to vomit 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 And help me, this device is very cool 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300
 It is a good way to start if 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.100
 You want to create your own file. Awad 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 Use SPARK GAP as Tesla did 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.200
 This device uses (excellent shielding circuit) 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 Let you do great things 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.400
 You can upload MIDI files to 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.000
 A memory card in the device will be turned on 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.400
 Any song you want 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 I want to hear the song O Fortuna 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.200
 Clearly, the next step is to try to dazzle the children 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.300
 that's awesome 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 After that we gradually began to try to reach the limits of our apparatus to see what it was capable of doing 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.000
 But I took too much confidence and during my enthusiasm 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I started doing things that prevent the machine's manual from doing 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 Looking at it is somewhat fun 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.600
 Because you can see the second end 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.300
 Which drove me out of mania and fun to remorse 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600
 Do you see this? 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.700
 It's broken! 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.500
 I broke it, I feel bad about this 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 Because I knew what I was doing 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.900
 I tried to break the rectifier, 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 Or IGBT and I'm sad now. Even though it is a hand-made file. We can fix it quickly but 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.000
 Instead of working on it, why not go? 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.400
 To visit a friend in my city, which he has 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.100
 Dedicated website for Tesla files 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.400
 I found him today, and I did not meet him before 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 And we will be the best friends 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.000
 It has a slightly larger file 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.900
 Let's go and get smarter every day (channel name) 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.000
 This is Cameron Prince. He runs the first site 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 The online information about Tesla 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.400
 And its address is www.teslauniverse.com 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.000
 It offers Tesla files 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 He happened to live on the other side 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 From the street where my aunt and uncle live. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.300
 This is a little big about what I have 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.000
 How big is this 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
 It's about 2.74 meters high 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 2.74 meters high? Have you built it? 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.300
 Yes, it's as big as you can 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.800
 It is suitable for garage 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.600
 Really, yes, if this was according to design requirements 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.800
 Yes, these are the limits of design 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.700
 Do this store of capacitors at the bottom 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.900
 Yes, it's a large store of capacitors 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.000
 My friend, this is not a joke 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.700
 These were extracted from the MRI machine 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.600
 Truly, this is the most rewarding part of the whole machine 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.400
 Aam is possible 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 Do cats always walk around when you try 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.200
 This will roast the cat, man 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200
 Cameron the perfect example, when you 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.800
 As a child I collected baseball cards and boarded 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.000
 My bike, Cameron did not do. His life changed 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.400
 Forever when he first saw a picture of Nikola Tesla 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.500
 When I saw those pictures 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.400
 His Colorado Springs, IN 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.500
 His experiences, sitting in front of his file 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.700
 And that lightning around him 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.500
 Then she was captured. As most people know Kanoo 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.600
 In their childhood they throw baseball balls 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 And others. I had a box of bulbs, wires and generators 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.800
 that's cool. I love when people get excited about something that makes it more entertaining 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.100
 Well, let's start 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.400
 Time off, there are some experiments 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.700
 We can not connect them online and these 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.800
 And this is one of them. We are talking about 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.900
 6 meters of lightning strike 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.200
 The earth is continually before you. 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 This was fantastic. My heart never beat before 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.700
 Zero to 100 percent in this short period 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.900
 from time. I have been .......... on the whole. I can not explain this 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.400
 So I will not be able to try to explain this 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 After he brought things down a bit. Cameron Salney if 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.100
 I wanted to see a real Tesla pistol 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.900
 Which I did not know existed 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.400
 We have this pistol of a designed kit 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000
 From two of his friends Steve Ward and Flip Slawinski 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.300
 There are only a few of these revolvers present 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.800
 In the world, I apologize for 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 Laugh here, but I was really, really, excited 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.500
 It does not look real, you feel like it 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.800
 Somewhat in a video game 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.300
 How do you control output power? 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.200
 This screen is here 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.000
 This is something of a ghost hunter (film) 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.700
 Absolutely yes 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.700
 Where should I stand? 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.300
 Anywhere, I want to help with the screw that screw up there 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.400
 Where should I stand, anywhere, oh my friend 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.300
 This is too low 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.100
 But I can increase its intensity 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.700
 Do you know that feeling when 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.600
 Have someone carrying a loaded gun next to you 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.800
 But the pistol can launch anywhere 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.000
 If I go back now. 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 Wow . So where is the prompt? why not 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 Return to Earth? 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.900
 If so, this primary file (initial) 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.300
 You do not have to dispose of an antenna in this! 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.200
 It's a water cooler 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.400
 Did you know what was strange to me and wanted to study the Tesla file 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.100
 I started looking at Google, and you live where I live. 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.500
 Yes, this is strange 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.900
 One more time, please 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.400
 Well, well, let's prepare for maximum speed 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.000
 After capturing some videos by 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.900
 Phantom (camera name), found that lighting is not enough problem it's too dark 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.500
 To see the gun but I needed the darkness to be able to see lightning. Cameron agreed 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500
 To bring the gun to my home in 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 Next at sunset, if so I can 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.500
 Sunlight to light the weapon 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.800
 And used a black background to be able to 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.500
 Lightning recording goes out of arms 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.700
 B 28,000 frames per second 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.500
 Got it, got it. 

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.500
 Well, after watching this slow show and watch 

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.000
 Lightning bends back toward Cameron 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 The obvious question is: What? 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.700
 Happens if you hit? its just 

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.200
 Cleans its Tesla file 

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.400
 What?? 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.200
 He hits your hand? 

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.700
 What? Does this pass through your heart 

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.100
 I mean yes, but it is a very low current 

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.700
 The initial file (initial) in the Tesla file circuit? Assassin does not talk here 

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.100
 But in the secondary file 

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.500
 The output shall be in micrograms. Which 

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.100
 Generally acceptable to be safe, but some 

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.600
 People still say it's dangerous 

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.500
 Here is the following 

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.800
 Do not do this, many people say 

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.600
 This is safe and others say this is dangerous 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.300
 I really wanted to touch it 

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.700
 Well, you are ready to launch high-calorie 

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.600
 Well, I'm really fine 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.100
 He just scared me 

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.800
 Well, go ahead 

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500
 If after taking this shock, Cameron Salney 

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.300
 If you want to launch myself. I do not know 

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.900
 If this is a transit ritual or what? 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.600
 But, Um, yes I want to throw lightning from my fingers 

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.300
 This is like a video game 

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.400
 I can not thank you for letting me do this, 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.200
 I mean like this .. the child is just inside me .... 

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.900
 Well, I must return your weapon to you 

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.300
 I enjoyed playing this video very much 

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.000
 I mean I just wanted to have a Tesla file 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.700
 And all this happened, I am very 

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
 Video enthusiast, after all if 

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.000
 You enjoyed this video, and you wanted it 

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.600
 Support Smarter Every Day if supported 

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.900
 Who support Smarter Every Day 

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.600
 There Audrey of Tesla 1 will
