 Hello I (Destin) 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 Slow flight of the most difficult things because the flow of air is a bit 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.080
 From around the control area. Flying in an area where the air speed is nil is the hardest. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.160
 Over the past weekend I have a summit with a flying humming bird observation 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.190
 In my back garden. So let's look at my notes and then we will return, we will take a look 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.230
 In flying birds. You become smarter every day 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.340
 What is the relationship between olive oil and laser? 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.370
 Buzz birds, intuitive! Doctor (Doug and Rick) 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.380
 At the University of Oregon, and Dr. (Brett Tolbsky) at the University of Montana 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
 They examined the tonnage using a nozzle to spray olive oil 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
 In the air around the hummingbird. Then using a laser 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.570
 They split the air into slices where olive oil is 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.630
 For the flow of the field. Essentially, he called for the photocopying of the digital particles by using them 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.640
 Flasometer. What you need to do is get a picture of an oil drop, and wait 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 Take a limited amount of time and do it again. This gives you 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.700
 Two-dimensional images of the flow field around the hummingbird, this is excellent. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.730
 What you can do is use this information to calculate exactly 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.770
 What a humming bird does to stay high. In these pictures you can see here, 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.810
 Altalamat under the wing. Using this technique 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.840
 Discovered that about 70% of the humming bird lift comes from the break, 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.880
 30% comes from the rebound. It's not 50% and 50% like what you think 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.930
 Another thing I noticed was when the hummingbird approached the feeder 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.000
 I did not know why, so I asked Dr. (and Rick) 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.030
 Dr. Werick and his team of biomechanists do not know why a tail jerk does. 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.110
 They are not sure if he is doing this to change the flow of air around his body 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.140
 Or by changing the center of gravity under its wings so that it can maneuver as such. 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.150
 Ma Yumon is creating a six-wheel model of the mermaid so they can 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160
 From studying this in greater depth. If you would like to know more about this topic, see the links in the video 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.190
 A lot of people asked about the type of camera he used, 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.230
 From Vision Research, place a link in the description for you 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.270
 So you can go to their website. Otherwise you can squeeze this nutrient 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.480
 And subscription.

 On the link below, I hope you are smarter every day 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.420
 This....... 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.470
 Tasty
