 Hello, I am in Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.610
 Well today we will learn how helicopters work. In fact, we will get started 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 our thinking hats, my have this look, 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.990
 and we will make a whole series of videos. See one big one. We will show you what it is. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.180
 Become smarter every day! 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 The reason I am in Tennessee to record this is that in Carl, 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.790
 I'm pretty sure, I'm a magician. I do not joke Is it ok if I bring this helmet throughout the video? 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.970
 (Carl) Yes, it hurts a lot. (Destin) OK. Carl will do this helicopter 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.160
 in ways that I did not even know were possible. The next videos will be all about 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.210
 how helicopters work They are much more complicated than you think, but now 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.400
 I just want you to see this. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
 [rotor noise] 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.370
 (Destin) What kind of witchcraft is this? 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.720
 Can you fly it by valley? 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.060
 So, that is why today we are working with Carl. 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.230
 For this reason. That's how you cut the lawn 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 to Tennessee, eh? (Carl) Oh yes. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.070
 What you do not notice is that there is a wind of at 16 km / h and he is ... [river] 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.250
 He is doing this in the middle of this wind. It's pretty flipant. 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.290
 (Destin) You realize that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.480
 this is some type of black magic, right? (Carl) Oh, it defies all the physics, do not you think? [laugh] 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.180
 So you'll make the numbers of that. (Destin) Nano, that has been confusing. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.860
 OK, if you want to know more about how these helicopters work, be aware. To the next videos 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.050
 I will use high speed video, night flights, long photography 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.230
 exhibition Basically, a handful of tricks to teach your tricks. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.420
 So you see and subscribe and you will see all these videos. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.510
 And, will you fly a little more? (Carl) See, no problem. (Destin) Let's fly over. Just because it's amazing. 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.100
