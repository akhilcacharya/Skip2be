 [music] 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.060
 Hey, here, Destin, welcome back 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.080
 u Smarter every day. You certainly know what great science is coming to us 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 from space telescopes, but you probably do not know what a great science 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
 they're getting into these things to work. For example, check out this NASA photo. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.200
 Here they are working on the James Webba Space Telescope Shield, and what I like about this picture, 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 my dad is right downstairs. This device is working 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240
 at a temperature of about 45 Kelvin sticks, but the heat is constantly coming from the sun. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.280
 So my dad uses this 3D laser scanner to make sure, 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.310
 that the solar shield is perfect for providing a stable work environment for the telescope. 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.912
 Thousand up for you, Dad, I'm proud of you. 

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:44.338
 I thought I understood how telescopes in the universe were filming, 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.440
 but it turned out to be far more complicated 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 than I thought. I will explain two ways you can apply the external force 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.923
 on the satellite so it turns. 

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:55.958
 The first way - missiles 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.600
 So we have our telescope in orbit, 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.020
 how do we turn it on a star now? 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.650
 Rockets are great, but they consume fuel, which pollutes the surroundings of the satellite 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 and you can get fuel and have a mission. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.473
 So how to do it without rockets? 

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.798
 Think about 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.850
 this small compass shot. It is the Earth's magnetic field, 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
 but what if we make it bigger and make a big shot, a giant revolving rod 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020
 and put it in a coil. Here we connect 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
 to the source that I have here on the table and zapal it. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.090
 You see? Electromagnetic field. So it is true, 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.140
 that this electromagnetic field in my hand interacts with the Earth's magnetic field 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.150
 exactly like a compass rifle that rotates? 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.180
 Yes, this is exactly what's happening here. I'll tell you why. It's called the swing stick. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.210
 Scientists are constantly using it on space facilities. They take three such rods 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.260
 and places them in three different axes, and they are capable of regulating stress 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 as appropriate, due to its position on the Earth's magnetic field. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.330
 This is a very elegant solution because it does not include any moving parts. 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.380
 The problem, however, is that it works only in places where there is an external magnetic field, 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.440
 such as Earth. It would not work in the deep universe, even on Mars, 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.563
 where there is a very weak magnetic field. 

00:02:15.564 --> 00:02:17.478
 To rotate the space telescope 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.530
 in such places, we must use the physics of rotating cats. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.540
 In the previous episode "Smarter" every day, using a high-speed camera, 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.590
 how the cat can rotate 180 Â° from the idle state, using rotation against itself. 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.610
 Check out the whole video if you need to refresh your mind. But what I have not explained to them, 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.640
 that the ability to change the overall state of the system 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.690
 without breaking the momentum of momentum, is a very special problem, 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.730
 which studied applied mathematicians, non-scientists, robot designers, 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.770
 and even astrophysicists. Try flipping cats in academic material 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 and you will see what I mean - thousands of equations. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 So to explain why cats are so exceptional, we take a piece of wood with a hole inside 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 and a ping-pong ball with a mark. Then mark the wood to see how it belongs to it. 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.920
 When we move the wood, the ball rotates. When we get back, 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.940
 the system is back in its original position. That's always the case, is not it? 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.000
 No. When we move the wood and go back in another way, 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.030
 the system will not return to the original position. 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.080
 So it means that the motion path determines the state of the system. 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.100
 Like a ball never slipping, the momentum of momentum is as for cats, 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.130
 so the cosmic telescopes never change. But we are capable 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.853
 to change their final rotation. 

00:03:31.854 --> 00:03:35.710
 Special systems like this are called Non-Holistic Systems. 

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.228
 I understand it's a big word 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.260
 and that you may be watching this video just because there are cats in it. But I need you to hear that. 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.290
 The physics of inverting cats allows us to take pictures 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.370
 like this one. Seriously. Flipping cats! 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.410
 One way to keep a space telescope pointing to a star is a device called 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.440
 stabilizer flywheel. Several such flywheels revolve inside space installations. 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.470
 If rotation is required in a particular axis, engineers calculate, 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.520
 which flywheel should accelerate and slow down and exactly when. 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.550
 Now I'm in one NASA building and we're going to a special lab. 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.590
 We are at the position management component laboratory. 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.630
 And these people know how to steer space satellites 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.670
 using cat physics. Here is our guide. 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.730
 (Dean) Come on. (Destin) Thank you for inviting me here after I released my cat video. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.780
 - That was good enough. (Destin) Thanks. I have a question. 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.790
 So the cat basically floats in the universe and then rotates. 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.880
 - Right. - How it controls its rotation without any 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.920
 of the external forces acting on it? - He basically uses his legs 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.950
 and his body to rotate and transmit the momentum. 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.000
 - You do something like that, right? You mediate momentum. 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.030
 - Yes, we do momentum management. This is happening at the space station 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.080
 or any device that drives the universe. We have to drive 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.110
 the amount of momentum actually in the system, thanks to which we know 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.130
 aim and focus on the nebula or star we want to see through the telescope. 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.806
 - And what is this device standing here? 

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:15.200
 - This is a power gyroscope. Difference between force gyroscope 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.230
 and a stabilizing flywheel is, 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.320
 that I can rotate its axes in a power gyroscope. And as you can see, 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.330
 this has two axis of rotation. Thanks to... 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.350
 - ... you have far more complicated calculations, right? - Yes we have. 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.370
 But here's a lot smarter people than I am 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.400
 and he knows exactly how to shoot a satellite or a telescope 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.490
 and get from one point to another after a certain trajectory. 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.500
 But if I turn this up, it will go to the point where it stops 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 and if I somehow got into this point, 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.530
 I can not go any further, so I need some other system, 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.590
 who will get me from this blocked position. 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.620
 - And here comes the action of external energy ... - Exactly, 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.640
 Here comes a series of magnetic rotating bars 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.690
 or drive nozzles. - And the Earth's magnetic field is the source of rotation. 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.690
 - Yes, it reacts to the Earth's magnetic field. - OK, so here 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.740
 you're testing these components to make sure they're in the orbit. 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.790
 - Yes, and here you see the test being done 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.820
 - Is that what the noise is doing? - That's it - What is it? 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.880
 - This is a Chandra X-ray telescope test, 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.900
 where we test the stabilizer flywheel, 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.910
 to see how long it lasts. If a fault occurs 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.920
 maybe on that flywheel, we'll get inside 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.960
 and we need to disassemble the flywheel - I see that this whole thing drives a pretty old computer 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.960
 - Yes, the Chandra telescope was built in the early nineties, 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.010
 so the hardware that is used to test Chandra, 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.040
 is the same one on the telescope, remember that Chandra is now 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.080
 I think 13 years old telescope - Wow 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.110
 Basically, you're stuck in time - Yes - When you drop a thing, 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.140
 you are locked in a certain time, and you have to keep using the same hardware - the same problem was with the space station 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.150
 or shuttle. They stayed in time 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.200
 with the components that were made in the 1970s. 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.837
 - Thank you very much - You are not 

00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:24.217
 - Thank you very much for watching. 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.250
 I hope you've learned something new about cats and consider subscribing to my channel, 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.678
 and sharing friends. 

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:32.298
 Gigi, bring it! 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.340
 Bring! 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.360
 Do you hear a bird? 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.480
 We had a ball. 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.510
 The only reason you can do it, 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.060
 is because it is a non-homogeneous system and you know the calculations of inverting cats. 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.580
 I would like to thank Jimmy Neutron for his farm 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.610
 and his cats. 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.962
