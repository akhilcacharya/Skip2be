00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:01.138
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:02.276
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:04.581
If you've ever watched Smarter Every Day you know that I spend a lot of time

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:06.013
off the grid.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:09.306
Right now I'm in the Amazon rainforest and I don't really know what this thing is.

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:12.772
I think it's some kind of termite.. thing, on a tree.

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:13.390
I don't know.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.457
Anyway, so one thing about being off the grid or in a developing nation

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.338
is light is always an issue.

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:19.671
Right now I'm using a headlamp.

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.060
I've done this all over the world.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.293
I've done this in Africa, I've taken showers by headlamp,

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:24.426
it's an important thing.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:28.354
But what if you live off the grid so far that you don't have access to batteries.

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:32.623
Today I want to talk about a new invention that I'm really stinking excited about,

00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:33.958
it's sponsored by Shell.

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.246
It's a company called GravityLight.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:37.215
Check this out.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.075
I'm about to make light in the middle of the rainforest

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:40.901
alone, with nothing but gravity.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:41.702
This is awesome.

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.635
I'm gonna have to put this head strap camera on because

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.072
I don't have enough hands, but check this out.

00:00:59.032 --> 00:00:59.694
So there you go.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:04.684
I'm in the middle of the rainforest powering a light with nothing but gravity

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:06.207
and that's a pretty big deal,

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.184
because humans have powered things with gravity for thousands of years

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:11.461
but we've never done personal source lighting.

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:13.430
So we're gonna figure out how this thing works

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.023
because that's obviously the next question,

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:15.924
how does it work.

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:18.070
Let's go to the UK where the offices are,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.930
but let's make a pit stop on the way.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.290
Harnessing the energy of gravity to power things is not a new idea at all.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.870
In fact, here at Salisbury Cathedral in the UK

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.699
they've been using the power of gravity to power something for hundreds of years.

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:34.164
It's a clock, and we're about to go mess with it

00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:36.139
and see if we can come up with any bright ideas.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:39.022
The cathedral at Salisbury is over 750 years old.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:40.709
It's home to beautiful choral music,

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.520
one of the original copies of the magna carta

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.173
and what's claimed to be the oldest working mechanical clock

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:46.334
in the entire world.

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:49.606
Clock expert Chris McKay agreed to walk me through the ancient technology

00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:51.726
of powering something using gravity.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.241
So it's ancient technology.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.429
- It's very ancient technology.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.293
Clocks generally work backwards.

00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:59.757
Most machinery is you turning something fast

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:01.695
and making it slower.

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:03.920
With a clock you've got a, you know, slow,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.455
faster,

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:08.014
and sort of fast as if it were.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:09.761
The motive power is this thing here.

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:10.892
This is a weight,

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:13.183
and it's suspended by some pulleys

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:15.261
which go all the way up.

00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.821
So the rope pulling on here tries to turn this wooden barrel.

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.708
And in fact it's turning it now.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.638
But at a very slow rate,

00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:25.700
and the rate is being governed by the escapement.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.170
- There it goes.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.509
[bell tolls]

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.460
[machinery sounds]

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:41.552
And it's stopped with a pawl and ratchet here.

00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:43.544
The pawl and ratchet's very clunky isn't it.

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:47.204
It's really loud, so it's like you have this nice sound with the chimes

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:49.496
and then you have this [kunk kunk kunk kunk kunk].

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:52.894
OK so there's two takeaways to remember about clocks powered by gravity.

00:02:52.894 --> 00:02:56.837
Number one. They take a slow moving object and speed up the movement with gears.

00:02:56.837 --> 00:03:00.484
And number two, there's an escapement that regulates the release of potential energy.

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:01.736
Let's go to London.

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:02.745
Hey what's up man, I'm Destin.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:03.694
- Pleased to meet you. Jim.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:06.921
- Jim? This is Jim Reeves, co-inventor of GravityLight.

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:08.707
Jim told me that he had visited Kenya

00:03:08.707 --> 00:03:11.088
where he had met people who had to use kerosene lamps at night

00:03:11.088 --> 00:03:12.697
so their children could do their homework.

00:03:12.697 --> 00:03:15.574
Children can get burned, the soot causes respiratory problems,

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:16.925
you've got to pay for the kerosene,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:17.865
and think about it.

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.712
You're burning an open container of fuel inside your house.

00:03:20.712 --> 00:03:21.987
It's a fire hazard.

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:25.386
Jim let me inside the secret lair where they developed GravityLight.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:28.136
I wasn't really surprised when we took one apart and found

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.600
a DC generator on the inside.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.580
OK so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna setup the GravityLight

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.206
prototype up here without a cover on it

00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:38.397
and we're gonna look at how it actually works.

00:03:38.397 --> 00:03:43.491
So I would expect that the side under tension is where it's gonna be moving slowest

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:47.917
and near the gear on the, or the belt on the motor with the generator,

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:49.152
they're the same thing by the way,

00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:50.862
that's where it's gonna be driving fastest

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:51.693
so let's check it out.

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:53.651
So the weight on GravityLight moves very slow

00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.638
and takes over 20 minutes to fall.

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:58.456
So how is this slow motion converted into something fast enough

00:03:58.456 --> 00:03:59.652
to move that generator.

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.392
The clock in the church had really large metal teeth

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:04.576
capable of holding back that large weight.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.894
But GravityLight is just made of plastic.

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:09.986
Wouldn't those teeth just break off under such a large load?

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:12.333
Jim taught me something interesting about how gears work.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:14.580
If you have two gears touching on the outer diameter,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.804
only one tooth is engaged at any time.

00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:18.953
But if you have a gear running on the inner diameter

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.161
of another gear, multiple teeth are engaged at the same time

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:25.077
which has serious implications for the life of the gear.

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.244
So if a gear is mounted internally,

00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:29.973
then you get multiple teeth touching,

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:33.201
therefore you transmit the force over multiple teeth

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.174
and so you decrease the contact stress..

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:35.862
- Exactly.

00:04:35.862 --> 00:04:37.484
- Increasing the life of the gear.

00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:38.325
- Precisely.

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:40.299
- I went to school for four years and you just taught me something.

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:41.784
Thank you so much.

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:42.920
Think about that.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.607
One side of the mechanism is closest to the weight so the forces are larger.

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:50.175
Jim uses internal gearing here to distribute that load across more teeth.

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:53.607
The further through the drive train you go, the fewer the teeth you have to engage

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:56.900
because the torque gets lighter and lighter as the speed runs faster.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.539
Eventually they're even light enough so that the generator can run with just a small rubber band,

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.484
which has the added bonus of being quiet at high speeds.

00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:06.786
When you said the motor itself is at 1600 RPMs?

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.429
- That's right.

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:09.515
That's one of the reasons why we use a belt at the end,

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:13.006
because if you did that just with a spur gear it'd sound like a bag of nails.

00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:17.608
- So the secret that you guys have uncovered to creating light with gravity

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:20.930
with these low powered LEDs is using ancient technology,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.083
which is just falling weights,

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:25.354
but the way you've done it is distributed the load

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:27.807
on the teeth in a very particular way so that

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.552
these things last a long time and they don't break or wear out.

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:31.342
- Exactly.

00:05:31.342 --> 00:05:32.426
- That's genius.

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:34.229
OK so we talked about the gearing,

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.817
but what about the escapement?

00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:38.297
Why doesn't the weight just speed up until it hits the ground?

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:40.792
LEDs are way more efficient than traditional bulbs

00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:41.974
but there's something else.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.848
LEDs have a voltage limit.

00:05:43.848 --> 00:05:47.509
Once the generator turns up to a certain speed and that voltage limit is reached,

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.858
the LED won't let it turn any faster.

00:05:49.858 --> 00:05:52.492
It acts just like the escapement in a clock.

00:05:52.492 --> 00:05:55.821
In fact, if you hang ten rocks on it, or gang 12 rocks on it,

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.832
it's always gonna fall at the same rate.

00:05:57.832 --> 00:06:00.772
This is how GravityLight can run for so long.

00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:03.702
- One of the advantages of GravityLight is there's no limit to that

00:06:03.702 --> 00:06:05.925
reservoir of power as long as you're willing to go back over

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.868
and re-hoist the weight off the ground.

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.109
You can let that run all night for no cost.

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:10.955
- So there you go.

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:14.485
Jim and his team are using their technical talent to provide a safe

00:06:14.485 --> 00:06:18.070
clean sustainable alternative to kerosene lamps.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.078
I love this story.

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:22.229
I think it's because the solution was so obvious

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.606
but nobody connected the dots.

00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:26.584
All we had to do was apply an ancient technology

00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:28.378
to a technology that we have now,

00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:32.328
and we can give light to 1.3 billion people that didn't have it before.

00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:34.856
So kudos to Shell for funding GravityLight

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:37.733
to help try to make the world a brighter place.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:38.772
I'm Destin,

00:06:38.772 --> 00:06:40.452
you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:06:40.452 --> 00:06:41.485
Have a good one.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:45.732
- So you plug the audio plug in the side of the product

00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:47.863
and that interrupts the power to the LED

00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:49.553
so you've got a really bright task light.

00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:50.629
You can turn off..

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.315
- What like a child's schoolwork or something at night, light homework.

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:52.960
- Exactly.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.117
What we're attempting to do here is to provide

00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:58.133
a really cost effective solution to people really,

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:01.047
but one of the ways in which we're doing that is

00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:04.156
to market the product in on-grid markets for people

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:07.957
who might be wanting to put something away for the next hurricane

00:07:07.957 --> 00:07:10.834
or the next tsunami when the power's gonna go out.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.786
Because GravityLight has no batteries in it,

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:14.558
it doesn't degrade over time.

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:17.022
So you can store it under the stairs and it's still gonna

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:18.943
be ready to go for you whenever you need it.

00:07:18.943 --> 00:07:20.614
- If you'd like to learn more about the GravityLight project

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:22.300
I'll leave links in the video description

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.507
and thank you very much to Shell

00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:24.625
for connecting me with Jim

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.307
and letting me learn more about this project.

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:27.165
It means a lot to me.

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:29.553
I've spent a lot of time in Africa and South America

00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:31.632
and I think it's really important.

00:07:31.632 --> 00:07:33.194
Thanks.

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.102
So to summarize everything that we've come up with here,

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:39.334
this weight pulls this chain,

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.159
which drives these gears,

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:44.072
which drive this motor,

00:07:44.072 --> 00:07:46.106
which powers this light,

00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:47.762
which changes the world?

00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:48.888
- Absolutely.
