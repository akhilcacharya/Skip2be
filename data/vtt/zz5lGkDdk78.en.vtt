00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.280
 Hello, I am (Dastin) and welcome to (the smartest every day) 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.100
 And today I will show you things 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.840
 It is super-fast and has nothing to do with all these guns 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.410
 In fact, it is much sweeter, (literally) ( 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.580
 Look at this 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.750
 It's a jar of honey 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.920
 I know I'm a bit weird 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.100
 But we were prepared by super-naive imaging, and we will show you 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.290
 The so-called effect of the liquid column file is how it works 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.470
 Just put some honey on this food stick, 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.660
 And watched him how to drain. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 Watch this, is not that great? 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 This happens thanks to fluid viscosity, fluid simplicity and twisting to the top 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.220
 And I think this is something very neat and we have pictured it 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 At high speed and then we will discuss 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.280
 More deeply. Fluid dynamics are amazing 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.330
 It's tempting to think it's an easy math question, but it turns out I'm still studying the subject 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.360
 Fifty years ago, let me introduce you to the variables 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.430
 This sector is called the file, and this is the tail. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.560
 (H) The mass flow rate in the material is (Q) 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.730
 And the primary radius at the top of the tail 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 Is (a0). The text in the country at the bottom is called (a1) 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.090
 The great part is the angular winding frequency known as omega ()) 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.320
 The fluid itself has its characteristic properties, which must be considered, density (ρ) 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.500
 And surface tension equivalent (gamma Ɣ) and motor viscosity (New ν) and the surface tension coefficient is gamma. The kinematic viscosity is nu. 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.680
 Well, simply kinetic viscosity is 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.800
 A measure of fluid thickness. It is a measure of resistance 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.960
 Fluid for cutting and tensioning efforts. The dynamic viscosity unit is (Boise = 1 millisecond. Second) 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.140
 The motor viscosity is measured by stokes (1 cm ^ 2 / s) 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.310
 The kinetic viscosity is defined by momentum distribution 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.390
 This is logical if you are thinking about spreading the momentum throughout the fluid 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.470
 As you can see here, it is clear that the mixture of honey and molasses is the largest viscosity 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.520
 If these complex words have bored you, wait a little, there is a scene in the bathroom for you. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.680
 But if you are like me and you want to understand what happens and you want to know all the mathematical processes related to the subject, well prepare for it. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.860
 What you see now are four different types of flow that scientists can describe 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.040
 Using the variables we have already defined to begin here 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.220
 This is known as the viscous flow system, that the rise of fluid (H) 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.250
 Which drops liquid from it is relatively low, 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.430
 Naturally, the gully is a spiral to allow room for glutinous flow 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.600
 It is interesting to equation angular frequency 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.780
 It does not include the motor viscosity of the fluid that's amazing! 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.910
 Compared to the so-called influx system. Second order 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.060
 The gravitational flow system is usually called the higher the height (H) 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.240
 The more gravity extends the fluid 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.430
 Viscosity is resisting that extension 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.490
 The value of the motor sprocket is shown in the equation 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.570
 The winding becomes regular and constant. 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.670
 This is the case that we have already filmed. 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.760
 The third system in which we will learn about the so-called inertia flow system. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.930
 When the height becomes too high, the velocity of the fluid increases significantly 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.110
 The fish are now less noticeable in the equation that the radius of the file 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.300
 At the bottom and embedded in the denominator of the equation, and raised to the tenth forces 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.500
 If you think about it, this means that the smaller the radius 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.670
 The higher the frequency of winding, the more logical it is. Well, fourth order 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.850
 It is my love reason for science. The more we know about it, somewhere between the flow of gravity 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.030
 And inertial system flow system, everything is suddenly trained 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.200
 The case of a file changes from a fixed organizer to an irritant or stranger pattern 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.580
 But if you increase the height a little bit, we will return to the regular file case again. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.770
 Or more, the fluid returns to the steady state (the gravitational flow system), but in the event of frenzy, the frequency changes 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.890
 Violently, but after further investigation it is clear that the frenzy will always be codified at a single pace followed without knowing why. 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.050
 This is very interesting and there are complex studies on this subject will link to the bottom 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.220
 So that they can see your nose. It is really astonishing how human beings were able 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.390
 Overcoming the dilemmas of the great era, but we still suffer in the smallest things 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.440
 If you want to know why you have this episode, you will also see this information at the bottom 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.500
 The situation has become a little bit suspicious, every day 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.590
 You can see the effect of the liquid column in your own bathroom. The only easy way to take a shampoo 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.680
 Which is a little viscous to adjust the flow rate 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.860
 And rise until you get the right pairing and then boom 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.050
 I've got the effect of the solenoid shaft, it's beautiful. 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.230
 Change the data and see how the effect changes 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.410
 I am not responsible for any excess in shampoo 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.640
 I (Dosten) you become the smartest every day to meet 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.780
