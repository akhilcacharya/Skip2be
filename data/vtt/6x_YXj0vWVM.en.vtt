 Hey, here's Destin. Welcome to Smarter every day. 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.360
 A dragon burst in my eye. It's pretty good. 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.678
 It's called subconjunctival bleeding. I think that's pretty good. 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.118
 Anyway, today I will show you 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.090
 my little experiment before we go to the hospital and we'll have a baby. 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'm uploading a high-speed digital SLR video (DSLR). 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.936
 DSLR stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex (= Digital Single Reflector) 

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:23.968
 and this is Phantom's high-speed camera, 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.850
 which heads directly into the mirror. Here I take off the cap 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.030
 and you can see inside the mirror that will pop back when you press the shutter button 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.230
 and reveals the shutter which then reveals the sensor. 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.400
 In modern SLRs there are two types of sensors. One is the CCD (Charge Coupled Device) 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.644
 and the other is a CMOS sensor (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor). 

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.018
 What I'm going to explain in another video, but enjoy yourself now 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.920
 damn great high-speed shots 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.400
 and excuse my eye. It happens. Anyway, keep up. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330
 We're going for a baby. Hey. 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.160
