00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.010
 Hi he I'm Dustin, welcome back to smarter every day. So there are many different types of 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
 Information in the world? Thinking about it. If you're a good mechanic you may particularly dislike the voters 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.090
 The smart key or if you are good with other people may intrapersonally smart. 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
 Now this is unfortunate because today I am not intelligent in the study area. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.160
 We're going to have a look at the components of boxing hits then we'll use phantom to record 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 Some slow motion won boxing, which is crazy then we will use those 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.210
 Data to study the physics of the mouth is actually do to produce 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.210
 The sound we know is boxing blows. Now I'm not smart enough 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.220
 I have to do this on my own so we have to go to meet someone smarter than I am. 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 I know this may not make sense, Flula. - Hello guys. Boom! 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.290
 [Laughing] OK. So Flula is a German man 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.320
 .. what to do .. music .. that's what you're doing. - Ya ya. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.350
 I would make win boxes episodes of techno, hip hop, stuff like that. Yes so here's the deal. 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 I love this channel because it's fun and it's no music and I do not really understand. 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.380
 So I have agreed to give me a lesson in boxing strikes? - Absolutely. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.430
 So this is a pedal rings layer and I can create many loops 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.470
 They are a layer layer higher layer. But if it can not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 Bring these to this machine and I have 4 different paths to use 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.550
 - What ? - Yeah. So you should show? - Yes please. 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 [Beat boxing] So here is a win. 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.620
 And now let's make it inside here. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.670
 Ok so far, it's here. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.730
 He lives inside. Now let's add something right? 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 let's do it. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.800
 Prosperity. Pay attention to the bass. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
 Now maybe some songs sing, yes? 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 is not it ? - Yes OK OK OK. I understood, understood, understood. 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 - For me, I knew a lot of different boxers strikes things for me 3 things. There is a bass, 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 like this. Then you have like a trap, 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.000
 Such as sticks, ambush drum. Such as a drum. - You ambush 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.040
 So and I like me like .. like it. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.060
 Like other people .. - Ambush drum? [Laughing] - this trap 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.100
 Then of course you have a high hat. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.240
 So put together ... 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.270
 - Yeah. Obviously OK. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.350
 Obviously there is skill here so here is what we will do. I make trade with Flula. 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.380
 I told him if he taught me how to overcome the box, I would create a slow motion video of his boxing blows. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.420
 This is what we will do. So I've got Miro here and what we have 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 Is it that we are going to look like your lips, are you OK? - let's do it. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.020
 De ... Do ... 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.030
 Uh.. 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.130
 [Laugh] 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.150
 I do not even think about it. Let's analyze this. Ok check it out. We have Flula here 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.200
 Which is about to drop bass and have already called me spectral. 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.260
 I've got the time in the X axis and must be in the Y axis, so watch this 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.290
 Check it out. Wonderful colors. 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.300
 Now brighter colors mean higher frequency at that particular time. 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.330
 Now it seems that we have these dark vertical bars, it's like we have 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.350
 Frequency within frequencies, and this is exactly what we have and this is very important. 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.400
 This is called a bell. Let's play C2 note on the piano. 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.420
 Now the same observation using triangle wave. 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.420
 You will notice the basic frequencies select note 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.420
 They are the same, but different inspirations. These are hints of how our minds are distinguished 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.440
 Different tools. Bell is also known as sound or color 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.460
 So think about the texture of the Flula drop bass. It actually has two different functions 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.480
 Work together. The first one is the ordinary tone coming from the vocal cords. It's just 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.530
 Normal looking sound wave. But the second thing is coming from his lips. When his lips slam 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.560
 Close his mouth builds the back pressure until it's high enough to blow those lips back 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.590
 The resonance frequency of this is determined by pressure in the mouth, flow rate 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.630
 From the narrow air how he pushed his lips together. All of these tasks are combined to create 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.650
 Unique voice signature. So if our slow mo notes are correct, you should be able to 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.680
 See all these things in the spectral true? Yes, check it out 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.710
 You can clearly see that the basic frequency of vocal cords has here, 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.760
 And you can see that the lips is closing shut every 25ms and stop that air flow 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.790
 Then you can see that the sound is up directly after the pressure 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.810
 The mouth gets high enough to pop that the lips are open, and if you're looking really really close 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.870
 You can even see the spots where his lip is closing again shut 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.880
 So it is there for you. Boxers won not only men with good rhythm. They're actually a dynamic activity synthesizer 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 Which specializes in hegemony not only time domain, but also frequency 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.950
 the field. Well I hope you got your subscription today because you learned something, but more 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.000
 Most importantly I love you to check Flula and sign up with him. He did not hear me 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.030
 I called him because we were in the same city and agreed to do so, and he has 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.070
 The smaller canal but I think it is very clever and I think it is worth the chance 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.100
 I'll leave some links here. He did the so-called car tunes, where he was driving 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120
 In the car he plays a full song by himself to take one 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.170
 He is very intelligent and I am very impressed. So go check it out, those are probably my favorites 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.190
 I will show you what to do with slow slashes, 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.240
 Funny in itself. Anyway I'm Dustin, you're getting smarter every day 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
 Be a good idea. You can do me an outro, and I'll use it at the end 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.300
 the video ? - Yes, of course. 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.550
 (Dustin) Thank you very much Flula. - Of course.
