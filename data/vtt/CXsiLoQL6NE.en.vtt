00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:05.302
 Hey! It's me, Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:09.130
 So today this set is a bit different. I have a question about breathing. 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.978
 It is simple. You see, we packed the third child who was going to the hospital to give birth to us. 

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:15.229
 My question is: 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.581
 How do you become "like this - my baby, in my precious wife's body"? 

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:26.585
 So, 72 hours ago, my son is still in my wife's body, but now gone. 

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:29.847
 He is no longer in a liquid environment. He is inside a gaseous environment. 

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.168
 So something has to change, and in fact, that's great. 

00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:36.117
 To learn more about the news, talk to someone who is smarter than me. 

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:41.550
 Ah, my wife can, but she is tired. good night! good night! 

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:47.201
 Well, so to figure out how babies from a liquid environment into a gaseous environment, 

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.061
 We have to be smart home. 

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.216
 So we came to the doctor's house. 

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:56.388
 Spiral staircase, you know he is very smart. 

00:00:56.508 --> 00:00:58.617
 So, let's find him. 

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.359
 Hey, how are you? Hey, Destin. 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.771
 So this is Dr. Schuster, and Dr. Schuster is ... 

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.263
 In the video we call you a baby delivery doctor. Alright 

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.131
 Well, he also plays music, and that lets you know that he's really smart. 

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.524
 So we have to get some information from him. 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.680
 Well, so my question is simple. How do we breathe the fluid from our mother's womb and turn it into breathing air? 

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:46.227
 When the baby comes out, squeezed through the birth canal, 

00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:48.960
 All the liquid inside the lungs, that is, the baby's ... urine 

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:52.454
 And baby's excrement, I mean, all the dirty things ... 

00:01:53.164 --> 00:01:59.448
 Once they were squeezed, those things ran out and the baby gasped for the first breath, the inhaled oxygen, 

00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.659
 What the baby needs. 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.068
 That caused a huge change in the circulatory system of the baby, 

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:08.652
 And that's the tone to get everything working. The baby breathes by himself. 

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:13.381
 So when the baby breathes for the first time, is there really something like a switch on or what? 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.967
 Some gates change the circulation inside the heart - changing the pipeline - if you want to say that. really? Ok. 

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:21.879
 Which of these gates ... Where are these gates in the heart? 

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:26.147
 The upper part of the heart. Correct! There is something called "foramen ovale" 

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.255
 It is a large lid between the left and right atriums. 

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:33.796
 Once the baby gets the first bit of oxygen - the first breath, it closes. 

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:37.462
 Well, so that's amazing. So for the first time baby sucks ... 

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:43.370
 That is why the first cry was so special because at that moment the baby started to live alone. 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.489
 All related to breathing. Yes. It breathes its own excrement to inhale real oxygen, 

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:50.351
 The real nutrients needed for life. 

00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:53.648
 Oh, that's great. thank you very much. You're welcome. Glad to be involved! 

00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:59.473
 OK, we have a young man here. Let's see him. 

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:03.771
 He is alive and well, his lungs are functioning and is breathing air. 

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.830
 Just one thing happened at the moment of his birth, this is the one on this side. 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:14.624
 I could hear that sound after he started making a little sharp sound ... I could hear that change as he came from the liquid environment to the gaseous environment. 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.021
 The nurse brought him here and she inserted the tube into his throat, 

00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:21.186
 Start sucking amniotic fluid. 

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.747
 This little guy started telling us his thoughts on everything. 

00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:27.910
 Look at him and look at his face here. 

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:35.600
 Hmmm That's what I said. Looked over. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.135
 This is the ultrasound that he was still in the womb five months ago. This is a real record. 

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:43.449
 If you look closer, you can see all four heart chambers. 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.878
 If you look a little closer, you can see the little thing Dr. Schuster mentioned. 

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:53.028
 Well, I do not know that, so I have to get my wife to draw it on the drawing. 

00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:58.140
 So, in your heart, you have 4 ventricles and blood, and when the blood leaves the lungs, 

00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:00.640
 It goes back through the heart to the body. 

00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:05.356
 Then after leaving the body, it goes back through the heart and then back into the lungs. 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.709
 We all know this. But this is when the baby leaves the heart of the uterus. 

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:16.194
 You have something here called "foramen ovale," and you have something here called "ductus arteriosus." 

00:04:16.614 --> 00:04:18.009
 I heard you, boy. and many more! 

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:26.355
 So what happened here was that before the birth, "foramen ovale" and "ductus arteriosus" took blood out of the lungs. 

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:31.411
 So that means that about 7% of the blood flow to the lungs. 

00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:33.351
 Dad is here. and many more! 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.938
 So basically, the lungs are very small before birth. They have not swelled yet 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.610
 Because of the "foramen ovale" and "ductus arteriosus," they are there, guiding the bloodstream. 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.612
 So, once it turned over, the "foramen ovale" closed in about an hour, 

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:53.093
 And about five days later the "patent duct" left to become a lace. 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.279
 I think this is really great. You can see that 100% of the blood back to the lungs, 

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:02.778
 And oh ... well, I'll hug him. You become smarter every day. 

00:05:12.283 --> 00:05:16.852
 The nurse was gone, so I started messing around with them. 

00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:18.589
 Wow! 

00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:24.019
 Look at that. Ok. Now I turn on the super flashlight. 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.409
 This is ... This is the active tracking. 

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:33.015
 Are you asleep? Now woke up! 

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:35.306
 Tolerate me check it out. I found a magic wand 

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:42.889
 What? Ok, optimistic. So, this has a big light source, 

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:49.941
 If I hold the magic wand against the light, then I begin to shine light and the light will follow the wand. 

00:05:51.223 --> 00:05:52.924
 It tracks it. 

00:05:56.047 --> 00:06:00.148
 So, it proactively tracks the light bulb in this magical stick. 

00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:06.057
