00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello welcome again in (smartest every day), today I'm in California 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.030
 It is a great honor to offer you a great man ... 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.060
 (Alan Seeler). -Hello. - (Allen Seeler), that ye know not 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.070
 One of the best photographers in the meeting is now super fast. 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
 So I'm here in his garden, and we'll 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.130
 Study underwater explosions using fireworks. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.150
 You usually shoot high-speed, do not you? - Yes it's just 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
 That's the moment when the bombing starts, which I'm looking forward to seeing 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 Uh ... Time. - Exactly yes it is not just one moment. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 This M320 is a Miro Phantom Camera 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.250
 And what do you hope to know here? - I just want to amaze, so .. 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 let's go. 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 0 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.320
 OK... 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.360
 - Fabulous. Let's look at the video. 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.460
 - Oh yes - ripple. 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 Well, we have decided that we want less explosion time 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.540
 And also raise the tire rate, to do this what we will do change the lens. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. 0 .. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
 - About 20 feet ... - Yes. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 I wonder if that was the impact of the explosion 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.710
 Or the bottle itself ... - I have not absorbed the inside .. There is a cavity shown on the top 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.720
 If you notice the picture. Oh really? Well let's look at the video. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.810
 OK. I have a scientific mystery, I need your help 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.840
 To solve it. Let us first define what an explosion is. is not it? 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.850
 Basically it is in the formation of gas, which you have to keep it in 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.870
 A mechanical device of any kind, which in turn increases the pressure. 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.890
 That mechanical adherence, will fail in the end, and the people burst 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.990
 But here is the question. After each shot when I go to find a bottle 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.040
 On the ground, I find that the bottle has been sucked inwards, rather than being blown out 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
 Like what you think. This is anti-intuitive and we have no reason. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.130
 My theory is that when the bottle starts to explode from the bottom, it starts to jump up at the same time 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 Like a rocket, when they do it they begin to crease like 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 Grandma's legs, as you can see, they push the rest of the bottle forward. 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.170
 The bottle lid has a larger block of side walls, and I look around that 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 Is that the bottle was pushing the cover, but the lid 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 Weighs too much so the bottle is out faster than the lid. (Allan) on the other hand 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.240
 He disagreed with me. My position is that after the blasting there is nothing but high pressure in the bottle, 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
 But (Alan) has brought me some of his Flickr account. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.270
 "He always sees bubbles after the bombing," he said. Always. What causes 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.320
 To form bubbles in liquid? Of course cavity. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.340
 A phase diagram is a diagram that uses pressure and temperature to describe a situation 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.370
 A substance, our data lie here, about 23 C 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 Now there are only two ways to move from a liquid state 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.410
 To steam. One is that we can move to the right and increase the temperature 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.450
 I do not think we heated enough water even to do that, so I would conclude 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.460
 That (Alan) is right in what he says. I think we are putting down enough pressure to survive 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 Steam limits The liquid state is treated to steam. And all we have to do is to go back again 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.490
 For the liquid condition is re-press, let's look at the cavity. immediately after 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.510
 Blasting, we'll see bubbles all over the bottle. But interesting that after 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.510
 150 microseconds on the next frame, all bubbles appear confined in one area. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.520
 Shock waves are coming from wall to wall around the inside of the bottle 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.570
 Towards each other and then overlap with each other a problem 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
 Low pressure zone. I think this is wonderful because you can already see the cover 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.660
 Absorbs inward slightly. On the next frame you can see what I call "the leg of the grandmother" 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
 Now I think it is very interesting that the bubble collapses from left to right, 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.720
 Which may mean that the pressure wave is moving towards the front of the bottle, 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.760
 But still confusing to me is that the lid is still sucked in 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.800
 So I persuaded (Alan) to take a picture with me but what I did not realize was that picture 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.820
 It will reveal more information from all previous videos. At the point of detonation 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 We have clearly high in pressure inside the bottle. Then we can see that the cover absorbs inward 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 Then .. Look at this. The lid starts off. 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.880
 This means to me that we have low pressure, and then high pressure. 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.910
 Once the fluid has been released from the bottom of the bottle, the bottle begins to pull. 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 Fluids from the top of the bottle with it. So we have a fluctuation in pressure 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.960
 Where have we seen such a thing before? Sometimes when I drink something using a sucker 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.990
 If I put my hand at the end of the lollipop, I can get the liquid out of the bottle 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.000
 Then I will lift my finger and watch what the liquid does. 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.030
 He wobbles. This is fantastic and I think this momentum output is caused by fluids 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.070
 Or lack of fluid itself. Therefore the effect of this momentum on liquids 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.150
 Applies to what we do too. When the fluid flows from the bottom of the bottle 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.230
 We can see that it begins to pull liquid from the top of the bottle and fold 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.260
 Side walls of bottle. This is very cool, but really 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.310
 Thank you for your time. Think about this more fun with you. Anyway, if you want high-speed footage 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.370
 Feel free to download the program. Draw me some pictures and show me what you think about how the shock waves move on the video. 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.400
 This man did so. I do not think it's quite true, but it came to a reasonable conclusion. 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.410
 I (Destin). You are smarter every day. goodbye. 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.420
 By the way, (Alan Saylor) 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.480
 Apricot is grown very well. The Russians have developed a way to use the cavity 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.500
 Create a bubble in the front of the torpedoes. This is called tropoid terabid. 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.540
 If the torpedo flies in a bubble you have less drag 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.590
 This way you can move torpedo faster.
