00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.060
 OK. This is to blow and make bottles once you understand physics. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 look at that. Left ... well, right, turn right. Easy! 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.930
 Tombarella. 1..2..3 .. See! 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.930
 Great! 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.280
 Well, as a child 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.460
 I spent many hours reading about the drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci. Specifically 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.650
 their flying machines. Look at this medieval helicopter. It seems like 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.840
 It would work, but you can not judge a book for the cover, because there is no way to counteract the pair that is 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.010
 It produces on the body of the machine. The helicopters of today solve it by doing a couple 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.200
 On the contrary with a rotor in an arm, a tail rotor. That works 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.300
 Stopping the rotation of the helicopter. But that's what I had not come to. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 In the end, you are applying a force to a floating body, which means that 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.660
 the body wants to move. So, how does the helicopter do not drift? 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.840
 We will make a trip. We will know more about how helicopters work 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.010
 to have a really deep understanding. How is Mr Ledbetter? 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.210
 Hello, I'm Richard Ledbetter. I am a teacher at the National Air and Space Museum. (Destin) OK! Well, what do you have to teach us? 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.250
 about the operation of the helicopters? (Mr Ledbetter) Well, I guess we'll talk about it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 The main rotor system in a conventional helicopter, and the main rotor basically gives 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 Both the ascensional force and the helicopter control. 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.680
 And the helicopter is controlled by changing the passage of each of the rotor blades. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.030
 (Destin) So, how do you change the passage of a helicopter when it is turning, when the blades rotate? 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.220
 We use, in most helicopters, something called a cyclic platter. 24 00: 01: 34,240 -&gt; 00: 01: 38,270 And essentially the one who makes a cyclic plate, is to control the rotational movement from a movement 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.460
 not rotary We have two ways to control the helicopter, i 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.640
 For cyclical entries, what happens is that 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.700
 the cyclic plate will simply rotate forward or backwards, and that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.870
 the entrance of each shovel changes, but by the collective control what will happen is that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.040
 the cyclic plate will move up or down. This, in fact, will change 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 the passage of the two blades of the rotor exactly at the same time. 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.400
 (Destin) Ohh! Okay, I just learned something. Well, to summarize, there are 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.600
 three types of control. There is collective control, there is cyclical control, 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.780
 and there is that of the pair. Obviously, the pair balances it with the rear rotor. (Destin) So, let's start with it 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.960
 collective, Carl. What is this magic device from here? 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.150
 (Carl) It's the cyclic platter, and it's the source of all helicopter control. 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.330
 In any direction you move the cyclic platter, mostly the helicopter 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 he follows it. The group is when you change 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.630
 The passage of the two blades, up or down, and this pushes the helicopter 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.800
 up or down Do not control the height of the helicopter according to the speed 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.990
 of the blades. The speed is always the same. (Destin) Take the step or step down, and that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.200
 It controls the amount of air taken by the rotors. Correct? 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.240
 (Carl) The same thing. If. Totally. And this is what he will do to ascend or descend 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.290
 the helicopter Or, if it is down by valley, the other way around. (Destin) Oh, of course, because he's out in the valley. 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.490
 Because I am a genius of the helicopter. [river] (Carl) The rotor of the tail, like the main shovels, 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.690
 It never changes in speed, so if we want to change the drive, 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.870
 We change the blade path, so it can push or stretch 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.050
 in both directions. (Destin) And this is basically because it is a bit unlike the 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.240
 pair that is produced here above. Blades apply a pair to the body, 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.420
 correct? (Carl) Yes, the act of turning the blades causes the helicopter to turn in the opposite direction. 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.620
 (Destin) It makes sense. Can you now show me the pint that has cyclical control? 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.810
 (Carl) Cyclical control is when the cyclical bowl is inclined, and through the links 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.010
 controls the passage of the blades and changes it at each turn 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.200
 to control how the forward or side helicopter tilts. 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
 (Destiny) Give me a cyclical step in this direction ... OK, but then if I roll it 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.480
 It will change as you go around, right? (Carl) Change. (Destin) Then .. then ... this one 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 Link moves with the cyclic plate and pushes up the side of the 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.760
 Shovel, and this as well changes the shovel depending on where it is located 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.940
 Turn around around the axis, right? (Carl) Right. (Destin) OK. So what does that do for you? 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.120
 (Carl) It allows me to turn it around as I please. 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.310
 [river] (Destin) It allows me to do magic. 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.390
 [rotor noise] 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.750
 OK, now you talk about a helicopter. 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.940
 And for the next videos, prepare to flip it, but we will use these fundamental terms, 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.980
 so get ready. 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.240
 Go and subscribe to see this series of videos. Is it worth it. 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.420
