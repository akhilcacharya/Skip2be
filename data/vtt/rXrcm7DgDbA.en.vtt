00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:02.482
 Hi, I'm Dustin. Welcome again in "Smarter Every Day" 

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.812
 Looking at everything I've studied and presented to the "smartest every day" 

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.747
 Or if you know anything about the nature and scope of my scientific achievement 

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:11.046
 Or the history of my family, you will realize that space is the sacred subject 

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.801
 Is something that must be addressed with reverence and respect 

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.607
 That's why I did not implement any series dealing with space in the "smartest day" 

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.584
 This is because either because what you have prepared is not good enough, or timing has not been appropriate 

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.432
 Well, now I would like to tell you that the time has come 

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:28.207
 I want to convince you to participate in the channel "Smarter Every Day" 

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:30.086
 Because I'm about to start showing a series about space 

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:32.675
 This is a series similar to any of the material on the Internet 

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:35.483
 I am not convinced of many educational materials dealing with space 

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:38.075
 It's like reading a dry article from Wikipedia 

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:39.715
 Well, we will not 

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.371
 We will do something different 

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.726
 In fact we will explore the hardware 

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.245
 Wherever this gear is located, we will go to it 

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.123
 We will examine it, study it and learn a lot 

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:50.254
 Things around him would be something amazing, at least for me 

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:51.622
 But think about this 

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:53.518
 The hardware does not build itself 

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:56.109
 It is made by humans, and occupied by them 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.184
 So I think it's all a waste of time 

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.995
 If we do not communicate with people 

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.099
 We know who is behind this 

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.363
 Hi, I'm Dustin, and welcome again in "Smarter Every Day" 

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.389
 I'm in the house of astronaut Don Pitt 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.555
 - This is my way 

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:12.593
 - Right 

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.216
 - Well, I like to set my telescope here on this road 

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:22.041
 And look at what you can see from the Houston area 

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.561
 And that light of the road 

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.994
 - That light there? 

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:30.509
 - That light is completely there. It is located at the very end of the road 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.652
 And Ali destroys his vision of space and stars 

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:45.506
 So I have this laser that does not need me in anything, and I found it in the scrap room 

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:53.177
 And I have created this charge for him, and he is directed entirely towards that light of the road. I'll plug it in. 

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:54.917
 (Man's voice) I was wondering what this thing was like when I passed from here. 

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:55.821
 - OK 

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:56.665
 - And .. 

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:01.453
 - The laser works .. Well this is his optical package 

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:05.005
 This package should be pre-oriented through a beautiful little suspender 

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.039
 Towards road light sensor 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.174
 You can see it there and it hurts 

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:09.892
 Let's wait .. 

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:13.423
 (Laughter) 

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:17.069
 - This is amazing 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.919
 - Now for those who wish to apply this 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.472
 Let me know that the green beam laser does not work 

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:23.214
 - OK 

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:29.519
 - This sensor works within the near-infrared and red-spectrum of the chromatic spectrum 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.071
 So if you try a laser with a green light you will have trouble trying to turn off the road light 

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:34.244
 But the red beam laser 

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:35.692
 - Well, how did you know that Don? 

00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:37.625
 - Because I tested the green beam laser! 

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.566
 (Laughter) That's right, 

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:41.346
 Is this a helium-neon laser? 

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:41.998
 - Right 

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:43.161
 - Did you realize what this means? 

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.357
 We are about to wander with astronauts 

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:47.012
 This is amazing to me personally 

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:48.753
 Because I want to become an astronaut 

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:51.341
 So I go out with the people I like to be like. 

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:55.608
 However, no matter what your knowledge here is in "Spectrum of Space Knowledge" 

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.072
 You think the space program has been suspended 

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:00.110
 It has not been stopped anyway, but some people think so 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.372
 Or your knowledge lies on the other side of the "spectrum of space knowledge" 

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:07.735
 And learn that the tilt of the orbital International Space Station is 51.6 and learn why. 

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:11.095
 No matter where your knowledge lies, this series will be amazing 

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:14.945
 Because space will finally be logical in a more realistic way 

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.461
 Well, that's what I'll do 

00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:21.792
 I will put a video on the space every month, and I will put a normal video from the "smartest every day", with the announcement every month 

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.095
 You can contribute in any way you see fit, at least share these things 

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.093
 You can support me directly through Patreon 

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:31.787
 Or if you contributed a normal video posting I can use the advertising money to finance the space series videos 

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.733
 But in any case I wish to share the spacewalk videos because I want people to care 

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:37.422
 The subject of space at least half the amount I care about 

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.192
 However, this is being prepared 

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.231
 So now I will present a glimpse of what will come next 

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:44.759
 Because I have filmed many things around the world over the past years 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.370
 These are some of the videos I will post 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.900
 In the series "Smarter Everyday" about space 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.286
 Not all of them, but I would like to participate in the channel 

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.516
 And to go into space with my attachment 

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.045
 I'm Destiny, and you're smarter every day 

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.653
 Let's go into space 

00:03:57.653 --> 00:03:59.074
 have a good day 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.034
