 I am Destin and welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You probably did not know Alabama 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.001
 has its own museum of natural history. We also have 

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.002
 the only meteorite ever to have touched a human being. Shall we look at it? 

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.003
 He is called the Hodges meteorite. He is 3.8 kilograms and has this 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.004
 woman hit ... Ann Hodges. It's pretty funny, because she was taking a nap 

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.005
 on the couch when she was suddenly woken up by a very big one 

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.006
 fireball that came through her roof and hit her on her leg. 

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.007
 He first rebounded on the radio, breaking the force. 

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.008
 They did not know whether to make the meteorite the property of the house, 

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.009
 or Mrs Hodges, because it hit her. But the people who owned the house wanted it, 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 so they went to court. To keep a long story short, she has the meteorite yet 

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.011
 of those people bought. Now it is here in the Alabama Natural History Museum. 

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:52.012
 So now you know that. The only meteorite that has ever touched a person came before 

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:56.013
 1954 in Alabama. I'm Destin. You become smarter every day. 

00:00:56.014 --> 00:01:00.014
 Let's cuddle a whale fossil. 

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:04.015
 Not interested. I will do it. 

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:12.016
 [WOMAN]: What are you doing? [DESTIN]: Did you know that there were elephants in Alabama? 

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:16.017
 Come and look at this. That is one 

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:20.018
 tooth of an elephant. That is called a mastodon (mammoth). [SON]: Mastodon elephant. 

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:24.019
 [DESTIN]: They used to live in Alabama. Do you believe me? 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 - Yes - Pretty cool, right? 

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.021
