00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.492
 (Destin) looks good. 

00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:03.792
 Perfect 

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hey, I am in Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.517
 Today I will show you something fascinating: 

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:11.241
 If you take a normal and spaghetti spaghetti ... 

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.321
 (you can do it at home) 

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.788
 and bend it to the point that it breaks, 

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.998
 He does not do what he seems to have to do. 

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:20.624
 It is not broken in two pieces, it breaks into three. 

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.636
 It happens practically always, do you see? 

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.859
 This has been broken in the middle. 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.651
 Today at Smarter Every Day we will wait for the children 

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.800
 end the dinner and we will look for the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.420
 Phantom V1610 to record this at 250,000 frames per second. 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.944
 And we will reveal the secret of why spaghetti 

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:38.118
 they crumble in this way. 

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:39.313
 You are getting smarter every day. 

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:40.805
 [music] 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.432
 If you have not yet gone to the kitchen, 

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:48.289
 do it now Take a handful of spaghetti and put on your glasses, 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.860
 because science is about to happen. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.608
 One at a time, take them by the two ends, and bend them until they break. 

00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:57.296
 You will notice that most break in more than two pieces. 

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:59.395
 Now you may think that there is not therefore ... 

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:01.339
 But, and there are so many! 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.066
 You will see that it is easy to understand why fold 

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.926
 a bar causes it to break into two pieces. 

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:08.809
 The bottom part is compression and the top to traction. 

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:11.142
 When the traction is over voltage 

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:13.561
 Maximum permissible, it breaks in half. 

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.760
 and finish with only two pieces of bar. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.839
 Why Spaghetti Are Different? 

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.472
 Something else happens here. 

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:22.789
 The simple act of spitting the spaghetti has left perplexing 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.638
 Bright scientists for many years, including Richard Feynman, 

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.038
 who as you should know, went to the team of theoretical physicists 

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:29.998
 of the Manhattan project, and also won the 

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:32.371
 Nobel in physics in 1965. 

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:34.556
 Everyone accepts that Richard Feynman was a genius, 

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.763
 so it's not surprising that his theory on 

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.394
 Spaghetti slicing in many chunks makes a lot of sense. 

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.279
 If you have already tried it on your own, you know that when you kick them 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.835
 notice a little vibration at your fingertips. 

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:47.189
 He thought that this vibration, if it were important enough, 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.715
 It could affect the first two halves 

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:53.238
 enough to cause a second fracture in the bar. 

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.902
 To put it to the test, Feynman and a friend decided 

00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:58.598
 Peel spaghetti under water to avoid this vibration. 

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:01.608
 He was surprised to realize that when they were pitted under water 

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:04.237
 It continued to look like they were multiplying in fragments. 

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:05.296
 So here we have. 

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.933
 If an intelligent father like Richard Feynman could not find out, 

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.725
 what possibilities do we have? 

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:11.265
 We will discover it in my kitchen. 

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:12.299
 This is what we are doing: 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.868
 My wife has brought many different types of pasta at home. 

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.003
 Those I asked for. 

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.729
 We have taken them out and we are doing an experiment 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.157
 With this high-speed camera, it's a Phantom V1610. 

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:26.396
 We have mounted the lighting and we will simply sit down, 

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.191
 We will break pasta and we will observe. 

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.005
 I have searched for the Internet and the fastest images I have found 

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.024
 They were at 4,000 frames per second. 

00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:35.656
 So to advance science, 

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:39.061
 We will start with a minimum of 18,000 frames per second. 

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:40.790
 What clearly should you tell us something, right? 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.224
 [Slow break] 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.882
 Ua. 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.149
 How fast 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.729
 OK. I could not say where it broke first. 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.699
 We will zoom and go box to box. 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:55.885
 [break] 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.952
 It's clear that it's going too fast. 

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:01.727
 The two fractures seem to pass at the same time. 

00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:03.835
 Let's look at another one that is still breaking more, 

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:06.371
 and we'll see if it brings a little more light to the thing. 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.495
 [break] 

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:10.315
 What ?! 

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.517
 It's as if it broke all the points exactly at the same time, 

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.057
 which is crazy because we are on a time scale 

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:16.991
 below milliseconds. 

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.230
 I do not know very clearly what those who looked at it saw 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.437
 to 4,000 pictures per second, but I do not see it. 

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:25.132
 So we will shoot the right up to 40,000 frames per second, 

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.884
 which is ten times faster than any of the studies I have read. 

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:30.638
 [break] 

00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:36.000
 Hmm. Okay, we're starting to learn something. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.725
 At least, I can say that the right side has broken before. 

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.060
 But it still looks like there are less than 100 microseconds of difference 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.527
 Between the two, that is very and very fast. 

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.155
 Let us also look at the direction in which the broken fragments rotate. 

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:50.334
 Let's look at another to see if the vibration has something 

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.998
 to see with the second fracture. 

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.396
 [break] 

00:03:57.557 --> 00:03:58.226
 No. 

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:00.426
 In fact, it seems that even the long parts 

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:02.651
 They vibrate at the same speed. 

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.826
 There is one thing here, though. 

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.701
 If you look at it, when the small parts begin to rotate, 

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:10.268
 It seems they always turn away from the first fracture. 

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:13.381
 The back, however, seems to break down. 

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:16.294
 It is as if the spaghetti tried to stand straight 

00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:18.796
 but he can not with his own mass. 

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.295
 Fit the belts, because we move to 250,000 

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:22.636
 frames per second. 

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:27.261
 [break] 

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:32.261
 Nano, we had to go much faster than I thought it would be necessary to find the answer, 

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.290
 but here you have it. 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.890
 I mean, it's not the vibration. 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.162
 It is the curvature of the spaghetti as it is straight. 

00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:39.921
 Think like this: 

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:42.529
 The spaghetti is subjected to a moment of strength, right? 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.027
 And due to this moment, it bends by curving. 

00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:47.668
 And when it breaks in a point, the side that touches the fissure 

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:49.159
 happens to be overcast. 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.170
 But there is still the internal moment, 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.058
 so it begins to move from left to right, 

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.870
 turning upwards and rectifying from one end to the other. 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.869
 Because the portion on the left is already straight 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:01.566
 and the one on the right is still a curve, 

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:04.036
 The point where one is with each other has even more curvature, 

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:07.401
 which folds the spaghetti below the minimum radius of fault. 

00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:09.035
 And that causes the fracture. 

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:11.662
 It is as if one side did not receive the message quickly enough. 

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:14.966
 If all the spaghetti was released at the same time there would be no problem, 

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:15.832
 but he does not. 

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.364
 It breaks along its length. 

00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:20.965
 Every time you have a new fracture, the process starts again. 

00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:25.061
 This physical phenomenon is called a cascade fracture. 

00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:27.206
 Until recently, the mathematics behind this phenomenon 

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:28.690
 they did not understand much 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.809
 But I have found a French study on it that has greatly affected me, 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.804
 as well as a very legal simulation that a few oil engineers have done in Norway. 

00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:39.462
 As far as I know, the video we have just seen explores in more depth 

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:42.571
 This physical phenomenon was any of the things that had been done. 

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.623
 We've just finished a quarter of a million boxes per second, 

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:46.454
 something awesome 

00:05:46.454 --> 00:05:47.696
 Well, here you have it. 

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:50.901
 The secret to spaghetti is not just a trick for the holidays. 

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.703
 Next time you boil spaghetti, 

00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:56.064
 watch, because you are about to explore leading areas 

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.932
 of scientific knowledge. 

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.940
 Thank you very much to see this chapter of Smarter Every Day. 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.796
 If you want to take a book that talks about things 

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:06.970
 that Richard Feynman studied, I recommend a book of Audible 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.693
 What is it called "What a joke, Mr. Feynman?" 

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:12.805
 I am listening now and it is really good. 

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.345
 If you want to support Smarter Every Day 

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.362
 go to Audible.com/smarter and download 

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:19.970
 "What a joke, Mr. Feynman?" and you will be giving 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.365
 I support Smarter Every Day and I 

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.543
 i will appreciate it a lot 

00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:23.513
 So, thank you very much. 

00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:24.536
 I'm in Destin, 

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:25.858
 You are getting smarter every day, 

00:06:25.858 --> 00:06:27.329
 have a good time 

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:28.163
 (boy) Uoo! 

00:06:28.163 --> 00:06:29.192
 (Destin) Have you ever heard of Richard Feynman? 

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:30.727
 (children) No. No idea. 

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:31.623
 - No idea? 

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:34.862
 - I have no idea who he is, but he sounds funny. 

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.533
 - [laughs] Well, it was. 

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:41.034
 He is a little different from his father, but he is a smart and amazingly intelligent paio. 

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:43.480
 Three 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.367
 Minimum four. 

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:50.277
 I hope this video has earned your subscription. 

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.564
 If not, just enjoy this confusing fish. 

00:06:52.564 --> 00:06:53.499
 Thanks.
