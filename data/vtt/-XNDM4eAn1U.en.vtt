00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hey, it's my Destin. So it's like this. If you watch this video, it has 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.070
 Potential can change every day of your remaining life. however, 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 It may also come to mind when you are alone and semi-naked each day 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.100
 I'm either sending this video to you. So I'll give you three seconds 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.730
 Think about watching. 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.140
 This is something that affects billions of people around the world, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
 But no one talks about it - at least not in a rational, respectful way. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.210
 In 1895 there was a "promotion of Christianity community" in London 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.220
 AM Worthingtonn newspaper. It has something to do with "pop", so I read that newspaper 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.440
 Having seen the work of a man named Weber, I have to think: 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.220
 Is there any way to eliminate the known "Worthington Central Spray Column"? Or like I like to call ... 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.360
 Toilet stool 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.620
 Well, if you imagine in your own head now, if you want to throw a stone in the water, 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.670
 What happens is that a hole opens, it is air, and those air are 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 No place to go, because there is a pressure break point, so it flapping back together. 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.500
 If you take it apart and analyze it, the surface tension is the force per unit length. 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.810
 Great goggles. Give science a praise. 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 A sample. how do you feel? I do not know 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.890
 You will not, but my body has never made something like that. Well, I did 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 More samples, but see how strong your endurance Hello. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 Endurance is what meaning? If you think so, then is the endurance of accuracy Hello. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.010
 I think we do not mind the accuracy, the pursuit of reality. 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.560
 Hey, Dest, I have ah ... what happened? Do we have a large size here? 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.260
 Are those beads? 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.200
 Technically it is. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.210
 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... start to pull it ... 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.380
 Pinch off 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.570
 What can we do to eliminate this water? 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.650
 The answer is to change the surface tension. You just 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.700
 Take a toilet paper in the bathroom 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.730
 Flat on the water. I like to use 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.760
 Four to make it touch each side. It looks like it will stay in one place. 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.900
 It completely captures all the bubbles ... 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920
 see it? 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.020
 now it's right. Is it fun? Are you teaching adult "er"? 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.020
 correct. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.290
 I hope you will not feel like us rude or not upbringing, 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.340
 We really are not like that, we will not ... good. 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.350
 It affects billions of people and nobody talks about it. Why nobody discuss it? 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.380
 I do not know, but you have to go home and try it and you will ... 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.430
