00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.342
 Hello my name is "Destin" 

00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:02.560
 Welcome to "Smarter Every Day". 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.100
 I'm not sure how it will end, 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.495
 But I would like to learn more about blame 

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.824
 I am now on my way to the shop 

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.084
 I see if they will allow me to photograph a process 

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.753
 Tattoos slow shooting using a camera "stealth" 

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:17.446
 Let's find out 

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:20.435
 [Tattoo Machine Tattoo] 

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:21.969
 Well, we're in the store 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.321
 This "Leah"? .. I suspect? 

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:23.828
 Welcome. 

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:25.926
 Yes, this is "Leah" and she is an artist. 

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.181
 Is not it supposed to say .. 

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.244
 So we call you? 

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.318
 -Flower and shampoo, and mole, and thick, 

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:31.799
 In England they say "blush" 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.846
 -Excellent. So let us know how 

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.015
 Chmhen someone by .. pistol? Right ?? 

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.030
 - Let's move the machine, do not call it a gun, 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.882
 I made a mistake twice. 

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:39.795
 - What do we have here? 

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.428
 -This rotary machine. 

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:43.941
 We use a range of machines 

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.212
 But the most common are machines with a hexagon 

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.901
 Followed by 

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.129
 Rotating machine 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.634
 - Really .. Can you show us how it works? 

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.770
 -Of course. This in itself is the engine. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.374
 -Yup 

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:56.500
 - The head of the needle, mm .. The best needle 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.356
 Up here, passing through a tube, 

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:00.803
 Here it is 

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:01.869
 Is this what you are doing? 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:03.846
 - Hold this, this is actually the handle. 

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:05.319
 I'll put the gloves 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.281
 I do not really need them now 

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.097
 For I will not reproach anyone 

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.543
 Everything is sterile, but it has become a habit 

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:14.773
 I find it strange to open a bag and I do not put gloves on 

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:15.431
 -Oh really? 

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:16.246
 - So I will put them anyway. 

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:17.441
 - Is it important? 

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.098
 -Yeah. 

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.014
 (Dustin): I thought the tattoo machine was confined to the tip of a needle 

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.561
 One and her needles are injected under the skin. 

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.015
 In fact there is a set of needles grouped together 

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.965
 For drawing, there is a brush-like tool 

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:29.571
 For shading. The ink is trapped between 

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:32.111
 The head of the needles using the poetic property 

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.587
 When these needles penetrate the skin, the ink is drawn 

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.121
 To the dermis 

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:40.315
 -I understand. You have a needle 

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.938
 In the tube connected with the machine, now 

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:45.229
 You are ready to make this machine work. 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.051
 So what are you doing? Energy I think? 

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:48.211
 -energy. 

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:50.345
 - Rotary machines are easy to understand. 

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:53.749
 This engine here is rotating 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.739
 Which turns into a straight movement at the needle's level. 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.097
 This is very easy does not it? 

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.576
 The machines on the other hand are rather complex. 

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.473
 When you press "Leah" on this pedal, apply 

00:02:04.473 --> 00:02:06.838
 Direct current on the two streams 

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:09.883
 Which converts the transmitters into electromagnets 

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.919
 And push the dowry down, 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.843
 Drive the needle. When the dart moves 

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:16.538
 Toward the bottom, it isolates the current from the seam nail 

00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:19.177
 Causing the electromagnetic field stop, 

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:22.317
 The spring then returns the dowry 

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:24.515
 Thus recharging the circuit. 

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.496
 Repeat this process repeatedly. 

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.346
 This is how machine tools work. 

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:31.878
 Be careful though. 

00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:33.610
 Even if you know how to operate it 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.676
 This does not mean you know how 

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:37.004
 Use. 

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:38.879
 Have you really bothered yourself? 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.603
 I did? Show me. 

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:42.453
 - Yes, it's funny. 

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.099
 -This.. 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.556
 - This is what happens, 

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:46.411
 - So it's a bad idea? 

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:47.540
 -Yes very bad. 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.200
 -What is your name? 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.831
 -Shun '. 

00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:50.677
 -Shun 'advise you not to tattoo yourself. 

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:52.560
 Use a professional like Lea. 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.569
 -Yeah. 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.614
 (Dustin): Now that we have learned how machines work 

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.210
 It's time to see what you're doing 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.717
 Skin needles. 

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.446
 I brought with me special lights and macro lens 

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.268
 To shoot 1,500 images per second in principle 

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.288
 So we get to 3200 frames per second. 

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.193
 That's why the tattoo hurts. 

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:14.499
 [Music] 

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:17.483
 Well I decided to taste a feeling 

00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:19.868
 Tingling this needle as it crosses the skin 

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:22.003
 Then take it off, and you may say that you can 

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.629
 Do this Don and Shammy. 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:24.819
 - Yes I will not use .. 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.832
 I will use only a needle. 

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.177
 - I'm a bit tense. 

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:29.276
 I would like to know how I will feel 

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:30.469
 But I do not want tattoos 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.787
 This future fashion is not it? 

00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:32.752
 -Yes in deed. 

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:33.517
 - Well, take a deep breath. 

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:35.087
 - Deep breath and then slowly. 

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:37.689
 [Tattoo Machine Tattoo] 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.164
 - Wow, that was not so bad. 

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:39.765
 -OK. 

00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:40.642
 - I can afford this. 

00:04:40.642 --> 00:04:41.207
 - That was all. 

00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:42.118
 - What did you do? 

00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:42.931
 - Are you here? 

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.105
 Ooh. Now I realized why people addicted to this thing. 

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.393
 Because .. because it is like fear. 

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:50.898
 -Yup. 

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:52.306
 - So this was a drawing needle 

00:04:52.306 --> 00:04:52.777
 This is the shading needle. 

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:53.113
 -Well done. 

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:54.980
 - How much of a needle in a drawing needle? 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.637
 -five. 

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:56.482
 - How much of one in the shading needle? 

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:57.271
 -seven. 

00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:59.053
 You are the. "Every day is smarter." 

00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:01.439
 - On the soles of the forearm I think it will hurt more than the back. 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.319
 - Do you think I can endure. 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.540
 -Of course.
