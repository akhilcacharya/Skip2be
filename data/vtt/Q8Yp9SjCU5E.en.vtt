00:00:00.228 --> 00:00:02.226
 Hey am me, Destin and well that you came to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:02.226 --> 00:00:04.836
 I know that every time you think about the archer, in the mind you fall Nottingham (Notinghami) 

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:07.278
 and a person in particular, Robin Hood (Robin Hudi). 

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.413
 But today I will tell you about a man of my abode 

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:13.457
 Which may be even better than Robin Hood (Robin Hood). 

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:14.774
 You are becoming smarter every day. 

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:15.395
 (someone in the distance) - Hey! 

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.195
 Hey, he can be! 

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:17.265
 - (Brady Haran) Better than Robin Hood (Robin Hudi)? 

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.791
 (Destin) [in British dialect] He may be !! [laughing] Let's see it then. 

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.799
 You will agree with me Mrs. Wanda? 

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:23.995
 - I'll agree. 

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:26.959
 (Destin) For years, when I was in high school, I heard about this famous swan in my town 

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.837
 who could beat everything that was thrown in front of him. 

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:31.685
 And now I'm at his home, drinking the sweet tea. 

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:34.598
 - I shot that brunette in Newfoundland (Nufaundlend). 

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:35.983
 - This is Byron Ferguson (Bajron Ferguson) 

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.824
 He and his wife exited throughout the world making shootouts for performances at live events. 

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:44.379
 I asked myself if the things I heard were real and if I could make Slow-Mo video for his profession. 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.769
 Byron, will you tell me what to do today? 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.903
 - So, today we will do some shooting for the show, 

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:52.854
 starting with the wooden disc thrown into the air 

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:55.589
 and then let's see what is the smallest target we can hit. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 - Alright. 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.893
 - At first we will hit this wooden disc. 

00:00:57.893 --> 00:00:59.886
 - Start with the wood disk by reducing the target with the throttle. 

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:02.191
 We have a Phantom Miro (Fantom Miro), that's why I'm here. 

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:03.257
 I control the high speed camera. 

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.431
 So, I'm going to fix it. 

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:08.846
 [Music] 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.390
 [Blow] (destiny) Amazing, 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.077
 but let's consider it difficult. 

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.723
 In geometry, there is a formula called the filling of the circle. 

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.317
 It is a way to determine how many circles of any size 

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:34.863
 we can put it inside a larger circle. 

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:39.066
 In the displayed wooden disc space, we can put in total 310 arrows. 

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:44.206
 The next target decreases the number of arrows we can input from 310 to just 55. 

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.531
 (Destin) How to persuade your father to throw things for him? 

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.573
 - I did not have a choice. He told me to do so, so I did. 

00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:50.512
 - [laughs] 

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.637
 (Destin) Well, he shot it too. 

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:06.255
 Lower the number of arrows that we can insert 55 to 21. 

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.741
 According to geometry, this is twice as difficult. 

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.180
 How can he achieve this? 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.068
 I understand how a modern archer can achieve with arch compound (compound) 

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:26.233
 because it has a complicated targeting system. 

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.016
 The Sagittarius looks at the needles at the front of the bow 

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.535
 using the target that is located on the thread that is on the back. 

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:34.669
 These needles are sorted with various ballistic variables 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.218
 such as the tension of the bow and the weight of the arrow, etc. 

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:39.970
 Byron Ferguson does not shoot with a modern bow. 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.521
 He shoots a long arch that he has designed himself, 

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:44.690
 and there is no sort of targeting system in it. 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.691
 His brain is like a ballistic ballistic computer. 

00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:50.530
 It's not just about precision, it's about timing. 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.962
 When it predicts where it will be targeted, 

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:56.695
 he should then be accurate with a bow weighing 70lbs (31kg) 

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:58.049
 to target the target. 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.385
 So he can hit a golf ball. 

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:04.194
 Try something 4 times harder, a pill. 

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:08.194
 [Klank] 

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:12.194
 [Swoosh] 

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.269
 That was amazing, we reached the last option, 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.624
 a single aspirin pow. 

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.344
 Finally, a misunderstanding. Well, roughly. 

00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:30.894
 According to the camera he was exactly the target. 

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:32.898
 It is recognized that the aspirin pills 

00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:34.229
 from the axis of the arrow 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.098
 which means he was in perfect precision. 

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:40.490
 but his timing was unclear for 8 milliseconds. 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.241
 Understandably, again it's super amazing. 

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.376
 but Bzron is not happy 

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:46.829
 and asked me to let her try it for the second time. 

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:21.706
 Tasheethe were true. 

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:27.050
 It's a person from my home country in Alabama who can shoot anything that is thrown away. 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.796
 to see what he says about how he does it. 

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:33.080
 - People always ask me how do you hit a aspirin pill ... 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.868
 Because I'm firing at the center. 

00:04:36.078 --> 00:04:40.108
 The aspirin center pillow is the same size as the beach ball center. 

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:42.305
 Always shoot to the center. 

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:46.645
 - The aspirin center pillow is the same size as the beach ball center. 

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:47.475
 - That's right. 

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:48.524
 - It's just a point, right? 

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:50.880
 - Very fine point. 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.679
 - Impressive. 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.465
 So this was one of the most humorous episodes of Smart Every Day. 

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:58.347
 And another manly activity .. [gunshot] .. is shaving. 

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.246
 This brings us to our sponsor for today. 

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:01.249
 The weapon is safe. 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.187
 In Smarter Every Day. 

00:05:02.187 --> 00:05:03.798
 The sponsor is Harrys.com. 

00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:07.522
 I used Harrys before he was a sponsor here, so I'm not just saying this, 

00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:09.241
 it is a product I used and used. 

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:13.633
 Go to Harrzs.com and use the "SMARTER" code and get a shaving box. 

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:16.052
 They send a razor, 

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:17.185
 send you refills, 

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:20.767
 and when the old razor no longer works 

00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:23.086
 you can change it with a new one easily. 

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:24.001
 Works very well. 

00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.237
 This is called Winston, this is called Truman. 

00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:27.370
 Truman colors with many colors. 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.108
 If you have the wishes to support Smarter Every Day, 

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:31.989
 go to Harrys.com, and use the "SMARTER" code. 

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:33.729
 In the end you fall very cheaply. 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.924
 It is cheaper than those available in shops. 

00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:37.100
 These are even better. 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.452
 5 tees. I'm sorry. 

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:39.264
 There you have. 

00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:40.236
 I believe you will enjoy it. 

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:42.133
 Go to Harrys.com, and use the "SMARTER" code. 

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.502

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.410
 Have a nice day. 

00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:52.261
 - Byron Ferguson? 

00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:52.892
 - Yes! 

00:05:52.892 --> 00:05:54.550
 - He's manny! Forget Robin Hood! 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.517
 [Laughing] 

00:05:55.517 --> 00:05:57.846
 Can you tell us a video about Byron Ferguson? 

00:05:57.846 --> 00:06:00.597
 - I can. Come and do it. [Laughing] 

00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:02.571
 And another manly activity is .. 

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.406
 [collision of arms] 

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:04.672
 to disobey what he is hunting. 

00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:06.537
 - Does not hold the arrow in the thread 

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:07.775
 keeps it so. 

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:08.769
 - Yeah. 

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:11.453
 - And then, down the linens. 

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:13.973
 - [Laughing] That's strange. 

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.883
 So there are two types of bristles. 

00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:18.891
 What I used to call it is [gunshot]. Winston. 

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.674
 But there's another one called Truman. 

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:22.679
 [gunshot] 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.064
 [Laughing] 

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:29.259
 Are you taught here in the sleeve? 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.360
 - Ca, yes. 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.142
 - Flint sleeve? 

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.618
 - Flint sleeve, shooting the garfish (fish type). 

00:06:33.618 --> 00:06:35.881
 - There's a lot to learn about Flint's sleeve, right? 

00:06:35.881 --> 00:06:37.630
 [Laughing]
