[Music]

[Rainfall and thunder]

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:13.315
Hey it's me, Destin.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.173
So I'm gonna explain why thunder
sounds the way it does.

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:19.812
And uh, we're in the middle of a
thunderstorm here, obviously,

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:21.521
so I'm going to try to make this quick.

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:25.953
So basically, if you're
standing on the ground here,

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:30.817
and let's say there's lightning
that happens way up in the sky,

00:00:30.842 --> 00:00:32.717
really far away from you.

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:36.005
So what happens is, as soon as
it breaks the sound barrier,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.055
that sound wave starts
traveling towards your body.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.003
But also, the speed of the
electricity of the lightning bolt

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:46.363
is a lot faster than sound, so that...

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:48.982
Oh wow, that's going to be a big one.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.315
At least I could see it.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.381
So also, that lightning bolt...
[Thunder]

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:55.852
outruns the sound.

00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:58.870
So the sound is simultaneously initiated

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:03.158
from all points along the
lightning bolt, at the same time.

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:06.965
So what happens is you get some cracks
that happen before other cracks

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.056
and you get this low rumble.
So you might get...

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.446
[Thunder]

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:18.464
a really low rumble, like that.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:22.338
So what happens is, if the lightning bolt
is really really really far away from you,

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:26.239
then all the sound might make
it to you at the same time.

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:30.245
But sometimes you get this
long drawn out thunder rumble,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.584
and that's because the sound is
coming to you at different points

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.185
from along the bolt.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.158
It has to do with the distance
of the lightning bolt,

00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:39.295
your position and the sound.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.066
So there you go.

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:43.837
I know that's not in-depth at all, but
I'm in the middle of a thunderstorm.

00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:46.564
But I hope you're smarter every day and
you at least get to think about it.

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:48.125
Have a good one.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.410
[Thunder]

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:54.347
[Music]

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.570
...Good at this, so...

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.991
I'll show you. Watch his
head stay totally stationary

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:18.587
as I move his body. I can move his
body in pretty much any direction.

00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:22.007
