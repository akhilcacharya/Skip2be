00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.070
 Hey, I am in Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day We are in the middle of one 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 series about helicopters and I will talk about ... how is this said? (son) parachute. 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.140
 A parachute Well, on the planes, the pilot 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 It can have a parachute, so if something goes wrong you can jump 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.660
 and use it to bring it to salvation. Do you want to try the parachute very quickly? 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.730
 (son) See, I'll do it. OK, we will launch the parachute on this balcony. Look 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.770
 The father will launch it. Are you ready? 

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:28.800
 Home parachute ... 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.500
 to the ocean 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.000
 Oh nano! [laugh] 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.380
 We just gave the man a parachute to our neighbors. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.500
 Well, think about that. We are in a helicopter 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.670
 And we are very up and we suddenly have a problem because the engine stops us. 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.860
 and we started to fall. So we have all that weight 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040
 endured by the rotor system. Now, if we are intelligent about it 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.220
 We can change the inclination of the rotors to make them rotate very quickly. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.280
 And then we will have a kind of windmill. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.350
 And if we are really smart, just at the last minute, just before touching the ground 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.400
 We can change the blade path to achieve a rising force. So we are 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.580
 by rotating the rotors in the reverse and right at the last moment we use them for 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.780
 Brake, just before you hit the ground. This is a maneuver called autorotation, 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.960
 and this has kept the helicopter pilots alive for many and many years. 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.150
 In fact, there have been autorotations from 12,000 meters. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 So a helicopter basically has a built-in parachute. But with a helicopter you have this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.440
 Rotary disk just in front of you, So my question is, what happens if you lose power 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 up there. Like this battery that I just put. What happens if he dies? What's up, Carl? 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.970
 (Carl) If you lose power in a helicopter you can rotate. OK. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.980
 So Carl will demonstrate self-determination and we will get an idea of ​​what happens. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.250
 Make yourself more clever every day. 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.340
 Okay, what exactly do we aim to do? 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.450
 (Carl) We will demonstrate the authorizations. I'll take you a few dozen meters up, 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.740
 I will turn off the engine, and I will do all the way to the ground flying off. 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.550
 (Destin) It sounds like the idea of ​​genius. (Carl) [laugh] Let's do it. 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.980
 (Destin) You know ... That's expensive, right? (Carl) Yes 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.220
 [rotor noise] 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.310
 Okay, then, where are you? As from above? 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.490
 (Carl) Aah this are probably about 100 meters. I count three i 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.670
 I close the engine right now, and now we are returning without it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.850
 the motor. (Destin) In a very expensive helicopter. (Carl) Oh yes. (Destin) So we do not have power, right now. 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.030
 (Carl) Not at all. 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.200
 (Destin) So why has this happened? 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.370
 What have you done? (Carl) We are cutting through the blades, 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.470
 And as the helicopter falls, the air that is forced by gravity to pass through 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.600
 makes them roll. (Destin) So it's like a windmill? (Carl) It's like a windmill. (Destin) So the helicopters are 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.770
 much safer than I thought. I will be honest with you ... I'm not very impressed because 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.970
 It has been a lot for all the time. [laughs] 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.170
 (Carl) Let's do it by valley. (Destin) E ... and ... wait. It was a joke, man. 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.350
 (Carl) Aah. Let's do it! (Destin) You can do it. (Carl) Let's do it! 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.430
 I am not responsible for what he is about to happen. 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.520
 [rotor noise] 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.600
 You do not need to do it 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.780
 if you do not want to do it. (Carl) [laughs] 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.950
 (Destin) Are you already in the valley? (Carl) Oh yes. 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.130
 (Carl) Som-hi. We will get to each valley. 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.320
 (Destin) So you have disconnected (Carl) It's off (Destin) a helicopter head-by-valley. (Carl) Right. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.510
 (Destin) This makes a lot of sense. The mother of the guy. 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.300
 [laughs] 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.890
 (Carl) We already have that. (Destin) Nano, this has been very strange. OK, the helicopters are 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.070
 long much safer than I thought, and if you want to see more about how they work 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.250
 See this series of videos we are doing, how to control helicopters. This is Carl. 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.450
 I have put your information in the description. Sign up, please. See you. Where is my hat to think? 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.640
 I need my thinking hat. [laughs]
