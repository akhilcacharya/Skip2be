Hey it's me, Destin.

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:12.149
If you have ever flown
then you have observed

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:16.507
this condensation that
builds up on the window,

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:19.208
where the, uh... the water
transitions to ice.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:23.485
But I'm gonna show you a trick to show you
some really neat ways to photograph that.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.225
So this is all you do: you take
your lens and you pop it off...

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.647
Hard to do with just one hand.

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:36.693
Just pop your lens off,
and rotate it, like this.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:44.310
So you can make a quick macro lens
that also acts as a microscope,

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:50.016
and you can see the transition
between water bubbles and ice.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:52.534
And you can take some really neat photos.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.767
Like this.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.876
That's it. It's quick and easy to do,

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.606
and you don't need any special equipment.

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.629
You can buy an adaptor, and I'll put
that information in the "more info".

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:06.918
Here you go, you are now smarter every day.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.680
Thank you Papa.
- No problem.
