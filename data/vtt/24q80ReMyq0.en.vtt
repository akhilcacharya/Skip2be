00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
 Dozen: Good Keith. Drop Prince Robert 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.340
 Keith: Drop Prince Robert, right 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.320
 Keith: The papers were sent in 1660 to the Royal Society, so these papers are very old. 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.360
 Destin: Hello this I'm Destin, Welcome to "Smarter Every Day" 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.200
 I am in the basement of the Royal Society of London, England 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.720
 This is Keith, librarian 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.860
 He has a special paper written by who? 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.040
 Keith: Mr. Rurbat Murray 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.660
 Dustin: Well, it's about Prince Robert's drop, right? 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.460
 Keith: Yeah right. Dozen: Can you show me that? 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.600
 Keith: Yes, if we have here a "Statement about Glass Drops" by Mr. Robert Murray 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.800
 Dozen: Do you show me the drawing, the famous painting? 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.980
 Keith: Well, if we turn the page 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.080
 Keith (reads): Solis is one powerful kingdom. But when the top is broken, divided into men. 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.520
 Destiny: If the hardness of Robert Prince's drop was observed in ancient times. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840
 Even in the beginnings of the royal society. That was early, right? 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 Keith: True, in the 17th century they tested the drop of Prince Robert, the old researchers were impressed by it. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.140
 Destin: Kano is impressed at that time, I'm still dazzled now. 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.200
 But today we will use some of the best technology available to us. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
 We will use a high-speed camera and record a bullet piercing Prince Robert's glass drop, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.300
 In a few thousand shots per second. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.060
 Let's go to get smarter every day. 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.800
 Dozen: Well, be impressed! Science will happen now, 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.420
 The first video I made about Prince Robert's drop was here in 'Lookout Mountain Orbix Hot Glass' 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840
 His theme was why Prince Robert's drop was so solid 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.020
 Today we will test its borders. 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.160
 If you do not see that video you really need to watch it 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.120
 Because you must understand what we are dealing with (Prince Robert's drop) so you can understand this video. 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 This is the equipment, I have a 22 caliber rifle. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.820
 Directed (Toward Prince Robert Drop) 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.840
 I have a super-speed camera here, 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.260
 This is v2511, we will lock it on more than 100,000 frames per second. 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.640
 If, I have a guided gun so I must share the target 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.180
 The accuracy will be a bit low, because that's what we should do 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.080
 In order to get high speed, but this will be great 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.200
 here we are. Prepare to dazzle. Let us do it. 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.880
 Drop Prince Robert my moving 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 If I have to synchronize the shot. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 (gunshot) 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.840
 (gunshot) 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.420
 (gunshot) 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.220
 OK. I hope I hit it. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.020
 (Music) 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.180
 (Laughter ) 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.560
 The bullet did not break the drop 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.020
 It seems to have generated a shock wave heading towards the droplet tail 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.060
 Then the tail shook, and broke, then began to break forward 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.240
 I will do this a few more times, because it is beautiful. 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.440
 This rifle is adjusted in the same direction as the ultra-fast camera. 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.380
 I'm a little worried about this. 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.040
 (Music ) 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.040
 (gunshot) 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.020
 Just to make sure .... Everything seems to be fine. 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.260
 Let's see the result now. 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.860
 It's a great 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.780
 this is beautiful 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.480
 This is beautiful, and this material science 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.060
 And if the researchers were in the 1600s. They had this technology. 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.760
 They wrote more important messages to some of them. 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.940
 That does not mean they did not do a good job. They were great. 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.720
 (gunshot) 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.020
 (Music ) 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.760
 (gunshot) 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.480
 This is beautiful. 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.960
 (gunshot) 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.580
 (gunshot) 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.080
 (gunshot) 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.660
 (gunshot) 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.380
 (gunshot) 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.620
 Where did this go? 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.880
 If there is a drop in the garden of the house and do not know where it is 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.840
 It was also great 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.000
 I see her. I see her 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.860
 There 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.780
 Here it is 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.880
 No way 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.760
 I will lower it. Actually bulletproof glass 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.600
 Keith: When the top is broken, the men are divided. 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.460
 The fact that we were fascinated by this little piece of glass for hundreds of years I think is really wonderful 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.460
 And we are still fascinated. This video is great 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.420
 Because we fired a bullet at this piece of glass and did not crash. 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.320
 This is amazing. 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.400
 And yes, she was as amazed as we were. Hello Cat. 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.620
 Hello, before I show you the impact of the bullet in the drop 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.080
 Can we do something strange? 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.220
 Can I convince you to unsubscribe from my channel by pressing unsubscribe? 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.140
 And then, if I deserve 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.480
 Please login or register to post a new comment. 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.280
 Subscription is now different and will be great if you activate alerts. 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.540
 To alert you every time I upload a new video 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.040
 If you are watching by phone you can do the same thing 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.280
 Just cancel and then subscribe and press the bell. I tell you this if you really think I deserve it. 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.700
 Thank you very much for doing so 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.440
 Well take a look at this drop. In fact, there is the impact of the bullet in it 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.860
 Which I found dazzling. Many people asked me if they were glass chips that they saw in the video 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.480
 No. In fact they are fragments. The bullet was shattering 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.560
 This was not a broken glass. We can still see the impact of the bullet 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.600
 In this drop. It really is really wonderful 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.340
 In the second channel image some of the droplets like these 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.100
 And got a little different results 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.920
 If you would like to see the other video I did not put here. You will find it in the second channel 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:08:14.360
 I would like to thank the supporter of this channel who is audible. If you would like to listen to free audio books go to audible.com/smarter. A lot of people want to know what I hear I've collected all that in the site. 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.820
 If you'd like to consider unsubscribing, re-subscribe to the channel and click on the bell 

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.760
 Or become a supporter I will really appreciate it.

 Gordon of 'A Shell in the Pit' making sound and music, 

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.460
 Brady enabled me to enter the Royal Society to meet Keith 

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.180
 The name of the Brady channel is 'Objectivity'. 

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.840
 I masturbate, and you grow smarter every day, happy day. :)
