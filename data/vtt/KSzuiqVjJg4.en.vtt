00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:01.312
 Well, I'm Dustin 

00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:02.600
 - Dee, Destin 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.006
 - Dustin, Destin 

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:05.236
 - Destin. 

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:05.992
 - I was injured 

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:07.169
 - Well, I've been hit 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.402
 - (Laughter) Well, you have this agreement 

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:09.536
 We are with Don Bett 

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:11.850
 - Have you thought of changing your name to something easier to pronounce 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.277
 - Just remember the cabin, there is quite a Dostani compartment 

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:16.556
 - Well, hello I'm Dustin, welcome again in "Smarter Every Day". 

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.785
 Lots of pictures you see from the ISS 

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.043
 Pick up from the cobla 

00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:21.978
 From the inside here, right? 

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:23.879
 The cobla lies on node 3, is it true? 

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:24.680
 - Node 3. 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.927
 - Node 3. Well, this is the astronaut without bitt 

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:27.998
 You may know this man 

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:31.194
 I've been tracking cities and many things like that 

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:32.493
 - Yes, I have filmed cities at night 

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:37.560
 The colors of the Aurora, the nighttime, and temporal images of the Earth (Time Labs technology) 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.574
 Lots of pictures you see picked up from this cabin 

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:47.534
 When you are responsible for taking pictures. 

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:48.913
 - is a professional photography that does not make him dust 

00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:50.963
 You are the undisputed professional in photography from space, right 

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.314
 Can you say that? Say I'm a professional who does not have any dust? 

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:56.052
 - I can not say that because I am really ashamed 

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:59.182
 - I will meet you on the other side, well the truth is the best undisputed 

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:02.056
 All the amazing lights of the Aurora Aurora are the ones he took 

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.233
 (موسيقى) Translation by حيان داؤد hyyanato @ 

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.361
 - Now this is the cover 

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:51.577
 - We call it a shutter, it protects the window from small rocks when closed 

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:52.823
 Windows are protected 

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:58.544
 The windows are thermally isolated from the radiation environment 

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:00.053
 - Can you close these things from the outside? 

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.594
 - No, you can close it and open it from the inside. 

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:07.112
 - Well wait, inside there is a handle you run 

00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:07.988
 - Yes to handle the handle 

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:08.985
 - which in turn 

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:09.866
 - Open 

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:10.735
 - From outside 

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:11.603
 - From outside 

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.965
 - How do you do this and keep the pressure constant between them? 

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:16.231
 - Using lashes (loop sealing). 

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.264
 - No, not less! 

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.384
 - With circular closing valve 

00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:20.401
 All sealants in windows and gates are of ring type 

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.219
 - Yes, but how ... uh my mind .. 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.301
 - Let's go in and see her. 

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:28.049
 Pay attention to your head. 

00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:32.747
 - You have here a complete set of sealing rings 

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:35.780
 And the axis you rotate 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.520
 - Well, how many of these are in the space station? 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.427
 - Seven, because we have seven windows. 

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.880
 - What happens if there is a leak? 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.059
 - mmm, then you will have a leak. 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.270
 - Only leakage and loss of air. 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.803
 - What you could possibly do was shut the entire cabin 

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:58.365
 Maybe there is a plan I do not know exactly what 

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:02.590
 But perhaps there is a plan to switch the mechanism 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.211
 May require work from outside the space station (search for space EVA) 

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:12.517
 - Well, my question is how can you move the lid off the space station using something mechanical from the inside 

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.592
 Without losing or changing air pressure 

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.269
 - so called good real engineering. 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.466
 - Well, you heard Don Bett 

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.936
 He said, It needs a good engineer to design something like this 

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.200
 She was told that the man had resigned from the space program 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.505
 He owns a shop to cut off motorcycles 

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.913
 Is Charlie here? Is it upstairs? 

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:33.939
 - Who will you interview right? 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.023
 "That's right, I'll have an interview." 

00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.008
 What is called this place? 

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:37.281
 - Pet Bull Products. 

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:38.484
 - Products of BOTT BOL? 

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.063
 - Yeah. 

00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:39.984
 - Are you Charlie? 

00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:40.630
 - Yeah. 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.318
 - Hi, I'm Dustin 

00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:43.091
 This is Charlie Van Falkenberg 

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.570
 He studied industrial engineering at the University of Auburn 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.692
 He obtained many patents 

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:51.205
 20 years ago, he was the chief architect of the design of the Kobla windows 

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.780
 After the project ended, he resigned and began his own work 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.067
 Now he is making this 

00:03:56.067 --> 00:04:00.535
 It is a special pedestal to raise the wheels to allow people to work on them 

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:05.806
 He is so modest about his skills that no one who works with him knows what he did to the space station 

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:09.077
 Which was called upon by Charlie and his team to free the space station 

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:10.482
 It is a beautiful name by the way 

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:17.126
 The program was turned into the ISS program, and Charlie's drawings were handed over to the Italian Space Agency 

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:18.898
 So that the Taliban can carry it out 

00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:21.321
 Charlie kept a full copy of the drawings 

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:24.824
 That's because every good engineer knows that maybe he has to come back someday because he may have done it 

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:27.296
 We talked about the knobs, and looked at the slanting gears 

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:28.991
 We talked about assembling parts and covers 

00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:32.794
 Well, we've identified what can be the most important element of this graphics package 

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:34.702
 This is the inner axis 

00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:37.305
 You can see here two cavities 

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:41.212
 These two cavities diameter 0.002 inches 

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:44.675
 The reason behind this is that the interface between the inside of the cavity 

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:47.087
 And the outer wall that presses the circular ring 

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:51.668
 It must be controlled, because you will take the circular ring and press it to become oval 

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:52.408
 Is this true Charlie? 

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:53.054
 - That's true. 

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.033
 - There is another detail about the cavities of circular rings, right? 

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:57.363
 - True, these are dynamic cavities (transient) 

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.626
 These are the truth of what is being recycled 

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:00.626
 - Have you heard what he just said? 

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.196
 He said dynamic circular rings 

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.020
 This means that there is a pivot going through. 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.760
 Actually ring the circular ring 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.228
 And you have the air you breathe as an astronaut, right? 

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:13.345
 It is confined inside the cabin using these poor little rings 

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.014
 This is amazing! 

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:20.563
 Well, this design I've been doing for 20 years still works today smoothly and ideally 

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:21.321
 What makes you feel that? 

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.120
 - I wish it was smooth and perfect (Laughter) 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.126
 - I was sitting here a few months ago and I posted something on Twitter 

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:29.016
 She noted that he had won the admiration of an astronaut in orbit 

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:30.868
 I lost my mind! 

00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:32.618
 But if you think about it, that makes sense 

00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:36.933
 These astronauts develop their skills and intelligence every day through the scientific experiments they run away from Earth for Earth 

00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:37.934
 That's really amazing 

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:42.373
 After all, I decided to take the opportunity 

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:48.178
 - Are you sure that Italy has implemented and built the design, I did not know that. 

00:05:48.178 --> 00:05:48.955
 - Do not you know that? 

00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:50.482
 - I did not follow the news after I left, no. 

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:55.341
 - Well mmm ... The Italian astronaut talked to us about how they built and worked. 

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:01.857
 - Hello. 

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:04.902
 Welcome to the Cobla at the International Space Station 

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.496
 In the Kobla, there are seven windows 

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:10.157
 Each window has its own shutter 

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:13.462
 And "smartest every day" that I have communicated with on Twitter. 

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:17.774
 He asked me to explain the mechanism for opening and closing window covers 

00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:21.932
 Maybe because I'm Italian, the coppola was built in Italy 

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:23.582
 So here we go, it's very easy 

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:26.615
 Each handle window looks like this 

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:31.293
 And rotate it towards the closure of course, if you want to close the window 

00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:33.955
 As you can see the lid is approaching 

00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:36.132
 Or shutter 

00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:42.102
 When it reaches the end, to put the closure 

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:44.143
 You should be careful because there are no bumpers 

00:06:44.143 --> 00:06:46.001
 It does not want to close quickly and hit the cabin's structure hard 

00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:48.679
 It is a direct mechanical connection 

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.846
 The covers can only be operated manually 

00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:57.678
 And it is nice to think of this axis, which crosses through 

00:06:57.678 --> 00:06:59.959
 The structure of the cabin to reach outer space 

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:04.018
 The grip of the handle is slightly cool, the metal part just not too cold 

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:09.148
 Once again, when you approach the cabin structure, be careful not to hit it hard 

00:07:09.148 --> 00:07:10.760
 Well these are 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.169
 Very easy 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.205
 I am the European astronaut Samantha Christoforte aboard the International Space Station 

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.565
 You are the "smartest every day". 

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:19.533
 have a good day 

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:25.372
 - She said the end of the "smartest everyday" of the usual space! 

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.244
 It's a crazy thing! 

00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:29.110
 Follow these people Twitter 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.702
 Follow all the astronauts on Twitter 

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:34.276
 They take pictures of the Kobla daily and send it via Twitter to your mobile directly 

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:36.021
 What prevents you from following them? 

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.400
 What was the name of the astronaut? 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.288
 - Samantha 

00:07:38.288 --> 00:07:40.966
 - That's true. So go and follow them on Twitter 

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.323
 Great things happen when you follow them on Twitter 

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:44.886
 Would you like to add anything? 

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:48.462
 - Smarter every day! (Laughter) 

00:07:48.582 --> 00:07:49.228
 - My Father 

00:07:49.228 --> 00:07:50.001
 - What? 

00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:50.928
 - I love you 

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.867
 - I love you too. Good day 

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:55.704
 They have sealed off from outer space 

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:56.608
 There is no need to do so 

00:07:56.608 --> 00:08:01.430
 If you feel that you deserve to be impressed, please click on these episodes to register 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.548
 Thank you very much 

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.555
 Are you excited about the space theme? 

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:04.315
 - Yeah. 

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:05.358
 - What are these things called? Did you know? 

00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:06.791
 - Pressure Lock Rings (Lashes) 

00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.348
 - That's true. Translating hyan daoed hyyanato @
