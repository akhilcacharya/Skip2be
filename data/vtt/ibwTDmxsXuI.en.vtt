00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 Hey I am in Destin, welcome again to Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.300
 Remember that a few weeks ago I made a video of Bale Effect in the garden of my house with a bonfire? 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.700
 Well, this week is a bit different. See this. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000
 This is a disposition of 20 cameras. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.800
 It has a software package that synchronizes them all. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.400
 That's how you do it correctly ... 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.280
 although ... I did it well enough in my garden. 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 This is Henry's MinutePhysics, 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.560
 and is about to make a Bala Effect show at the "US Space and Rocket Center". 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.000
 (computer) 3 ... 2 ... 1! I like your style! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.600
 (Henry) I think I've skipped too early. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.840
 (Recovering Images) 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.780
 (Destin) It's awesome! (Henry) It's amazing, it's been working! 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 Hello, you can send the video by mail ... Yes. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 (Destin) Yes man ... (Henry) Yes! Yes, okay 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.900
 You have to do it, you have to do it Destin. (river) You have to do it. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.800
 (Destin) Why? (Henry) Because it's amazing. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 Obviously what will I do! Okay, I'm going to do it. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 (computer) 5 ... 4 ... 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.760
 Well that's exactly what happens. Look (computer) 2 ... 1! 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780
 (computer) ... 1! 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.600
 This has been bad, I have not done it in time. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 The scene of the Matrix gun where they fight against each other, 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.120
 in Neo and Mr. Smith, let's see if we can do it. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.880
 (computer) 3 ... 2 ... 1! 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 What have we learned here? 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.900
 In the last video we learned three things: 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.080
 First of all, the radius from the center of all the cameras must be exactly the same. 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.940
 Second, the angle of inclination of each camera must be the same because it does not look shaky. 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.500
 And third, the exposure and the balance of targets must be the same, which requires them to be similar devices. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 This time, our setting was much better, and that means we can learn more. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 The first thing that we have learned is that the inconsistency of lighting is a problem. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.600
 There's a flash ... there's a flash ... there's a flash. 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 So a bad thing that has this configuration is that you have shadows at different points. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.840
 So, if we had to do it again, we would probably add light in these shadows. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.340
 Second, the cameras must be pointing exactly to the same point. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.820
 If you look to the left, the carpet point jumps a bit and causes the eye to dance. 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.640
 But on the right, Henry corrected this for each of the video clips, 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.920
 which produces a much softer twist. 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.080
 So, a great thanks to the "US Space and Rocket Center" 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.160
 to let us be fooled into the exhibition Mathematics Vives. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.500
 If you want to subscribe to Henry's MinutePhysics channel, take a look here. 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 If you want to subscribe to my channel, I will do what Herny is doing. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.100
 Do you upload it? 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.100
 It's like a Bullet Effect with my chair. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.080
 Well, it's two in the morning, it probably seems much fun to me. 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.200
 I have another channel, maybe you knew it or maybe not. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.240
 It's called Funner Every Day (More fun every day). This week I have a question for you. 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.300
 I'm doing posters, it includes lasers and cats. 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 But I have the question of, what words should they go? I will leave the link somewhere. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.500
 I'm in Destin, and you're getting smarter every day. Thanks.
