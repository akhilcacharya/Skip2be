 Hey, I am in Destin. Welcome back to 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.120
 Smarter Every Day. Well today I'm putting tiles at home, and in order to do it, I have to do it 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.300
 all these intricate cuts to be able to make a good base. Well, it has its what 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.510
 but many people have done this over the years and I am only the next one to whom it is, 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.700
 more or less like the physics of the helicopters. Well, the physics of the helicopters, as you have 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.870
 Later along the last videos, it is quite complicated. But what you have not learned is how they learned it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.070
 these principles the first time. So, what I will do today is to start one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.250
 playlist called "deep dive". Well, the deep dive is quite simple. All you have to do is 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 Click the list and start a journey that lasts more or less like a regular TV show. 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.560
 The difference with the deep dive is that you will learn things at an incredible speed. 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 So all you have to do is start the list, sit down, 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.890
 and absorb all this knowledge. Well, we'll go back to physics 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.060
 of the helicopters we have learned, but we will also learn how these principles go 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.090
 to learn. It is often interesting. Well, while I go back to make the base 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.130
 You go ahead and do the deep dive. Get smarter every day. 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 (mechanical saw) 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.380
 Oh, one thing I forgot to tell you. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.550
 If you are mobile users, you might not be able to click the annotations, so you'll have to click on the link to the description 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.730
 here below We see ourselves after the jump.
