00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.412
 Hey, it's me, Destin, welcome back to "Every day gets smarter" 

00:00:02.437 --> 00:00:04.349
 I'm going to do something different today 

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:07.219
 Let's start with a story. Long ago there was a national wealth 

00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:11.876
 All are based on the number of flocks you have. There is a rich man, with countless sheep. 

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:15.467
 While another peasant family has only one sheep. 

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.151
 But they like the sheep very much. 

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:20.624
 The father of a rural family wants the sheep to be the best. 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.214
 So spent a lot of time with her. 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.346
 Basically, she is part of a family and she is involved in that family 

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.404
 All life. One day a tourist came to the city to visit the rich man. 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.741
 And they become business partners. 

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.862
 That evening, they were hungry but rich 

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:37.649
 Tourists do not want to slaughter their own sheep 

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:41.335
 Sheep pointing to rural home. The rich take away the sheep from the countryside 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.039
 Cut the most delicious part. Rich people enjoy with tourists 

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.382
 The big meal filled their belly. 

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:50.464
 This shatters rural families. My father demanded that the rich compensate another 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.856
 Sheep was ignored. Oh, this is really sad. 

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.955
 But this is true. Sheep is your YouTube video, and the rich 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.063
 It is Facebook. Traveler is uploading you 

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:03.049
 Video to Facebook people, which gives them both something you can use 

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:06.044
 To make money. In the end how to make money online video? 

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.079
 You must have seen the beginning of the video advertising. 

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:10.541
 And you've heard that some people rely on YouTube to talk about life right? 

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.076
 But you do not know if this depends on a very large number of ads 

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.455
 In order to obtain these incomes. This is why many people think of it 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.282
 Find a sponsor to sponsor their video. 

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:24.304
 In fact, there is a sponsor on the final screen of this video. 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.845
 Many times these videos need to spend a lot of time and money to make. 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.894
 In some cases, people are free to upload some videos and succeed. 

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.133
 In any case, it is deserved to make video 

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:38.821
 Success or profit right? But the problem is coming 

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:43.836
 Sometimes people steal videos and reprint him as if they made it themselves. 

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.711
 Flula is a German DJ, my friend uploaded this funny video 

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:52.537
 To YouTube is called Jennifer is a Party Pooper. This thing in four years 

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:55.684
 Get 5 million views, great. Until you find out 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.394
 A Facebook-approved page to download the video and then reproduced 

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:04.079
 The same goes for 5 Million clicks on Facebook 

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:08.466
 Only 4 days! Facebook's formula is also compared 

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.654
 Favoritism Facebook uses Flula's video 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:18.438
 Play 5 million ads to make money. I was thinking about what Flula would say. 

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:23.181
 It's like I did a gift to my friend but the other person stole my gift, 

00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:25.963
 Pack up and say: Hey everyone, look at me personally 

00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:29.543
 Gift for you! Oh my god 

00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:33.644
 They ate his sheep. Finally, he applied to Facebook 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.306
 Do not do that. I'm sure they are happy to do that 

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:39.038
 Because they have made money. This is a serious topic worth discussing. 

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:41.913
 This action was Brady Haran 

00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:44.352
 Hello Internet called "Freebooting" (reproduced) 

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.192
 - Freebooting. - Freebooting. 

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.941
 Freebooting (reprint) is a use of people's work 

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.000
 Come as your own work, to be profitable. 

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.741
 Brady has multiple channels These are great channels. Often be reproduced (freebooting) 

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.110
 This is a video of his video where his puppy, Audrey, plays with the bubbles. 

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:04.884
 You will find someone reprinted it, and Facebook also use it to advertise. 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.912
 150,000 people have already seen it. And this click rate up to 1.2 million 

00:03:09.937 --> 00:03:15.036
 Shared 34,000 times. That is a share of up to 34.5 points reading rate. 

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.869
 This is no point rate calculation. 

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.143
 You try it, this is 250,000 times the video is shared if we multiply it 

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:25.354
 The ratio of the previous video will be 9.1 million views 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.436
 What happened? Being "smarter every day" is also one of the victims 

00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.915
 In September, I uploaded a tattoo process 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.783
 Slow motion video. That is my greatest success. 

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.819
 And Europe's largest private publishing company 

00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:42.517
 Called the Bauer Media Group downloaded the video, cut out all educational content, 

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:46.193
 Clip out my sponsor and edit all the links to the "smarter" link every day 

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:49.020
 Then reprint to their Facebook page (Facebook recognized page) 

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:53.804
 I filled out the form, sent the email, tried every single way to get in touch 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.112
 These two billion-dollar companies. 

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:59.057
 That is actually their most successful video. 

00:03:59.082 --> 00:04:01.282
 So I try to get them down, 

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.177
 And inside the company, actually reprinted, but also written 

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.574
 "Just in case you missed it" until "Every day becomes smarter" 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.791
 Twitter fans have shared this news hundreds of times, 

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.179
 Facebook did not respond. Interesting. 

00:04:13.204 --> 00:04:15.408
 Because the process of video off the shelf longer 

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.636
 The more they can advertise on the video. 

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:22.890
 Until the end they have it off the shelf has been read on Facebook 

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:27.049
 Over 17 million times. I am here to tell you. 

00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:32.540
 17 million times, can be very serious, can be very impressive college tuition. 

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:36.143
 After Dwayne, Facebook community implementation, sent an email to me 

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:40.170
 "We understand that this operation has been solved 

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:44.637
 Your intellectual property issues. "Facebook is like this, 

00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:49.013
 When you find these conditions, you can see any interest you've been dreaming of 

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.970
 Suddenly been snatched away on Facebook's page. 

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.708
 Then you get stuck in an email 

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:59.808
 They understand and solve your intellectual property issues. 

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.719
 I do not want you to sympathize with me. 

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:07.414
 I am very lucky and grateful that I am trusted. 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.235
 But I also understand not every one 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.782
 The channel has 2 million smart subscribers. These things happen every day 

00:05:16.807 --> 00:05:20.202
 Thousands of times in those who can not say anything. 

00:05:20.227 --> 00:05:23.194
 They look complicated, but not actually. 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.621
 Even my kids understand what's going on. 

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:28.497
 (Destin) But they are very hungry, so can you? - No, not. 

00:05:28.522 --> 00:05:32.142
 -why not? Because it is the sheep of others. 

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:36.652
 - Yeah, but they are hungry - they should go back, tourists 

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.824
 Should be put back. Why tourists should go back? 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.835
 Because he pointed at the sheep. - Then if I tell you every day 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.389
 The rich will find another tourist to bring sheep to others. 

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:55.846
 what do you think? That's enough to keep him in jail. 

00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.909
 -why? Because he steals every day. 

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:02.175
 - Oh, so simple, is not it? - But if there is no prison? 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.259
 - You know, he has a lot of arguments. If reproduced someone else's original really no penalty? 

00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:07.857
 I mean, people tell me 

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:11.608
 It is impossible for ordinary people like us to fight these hundreds of millions of people 

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.195
 organizational. But is this true? 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.705
 Are we finished? Because no money. Really? 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.815
 What I mean is that if a child aged six and eight can understand this unfairness, 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.573
 We have laws. 

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:24.803
 Do not you think courts can do the same thing? 

00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:27.900
 Things that may be right are sometimes really hard, 

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:31.254
 It is also very decadent. As the video says, those two guys 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.582
 Eat my sheep, the rich and tourists, actually refused 

00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:36.487
 Compensation. Really clever. 

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.033
 Delay him, let him suffer, I hope he slowly lost interest in fighting for his own rights. 

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:43.711
 Facebook reprint must stop, and you can help 

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:47.642
 As long as you see the reproduced content, where are good, do all three things. 

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:52.069
 Screen capture, message, contact. Screenshot of the reproduced behavior. 

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:55.622
 Or if you want a full record, you can video capture of the contents of the repost. 

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:57.950
 Reprinted by the content of the message. 

00:06:57.975 --> 00:07:01.211
 Tell everyone this is stolen, but also tell you original source. 

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:04.710
 Contact the original creator, give them the reproduced evidence. 

00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:08.462
 There are repost the connection. The originator can decide whether or not 

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:10.964
 Take legal action. This will make 

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:14.475
 Creators spend more time with their sheep. If you feel negative, I apologize 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.723
 This is not my intention. 

00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:17.614
 I just want to say no to those who can not voice. 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.812
 For example, Gordon, the producer who makes music for us everyday 

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:24.819
 His music has also been reproduced, you can see how sad he is. 

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.997
 Trading is like this. I promise Gordon, and we will 

00:07:28.022 --> 00:07:33.248

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:42.665
 I listen Ender's Game, really make me aggressive. 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.975
 Ender is a little boy and does not like quarrels. 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.122
 But people are chasing him. He uses his wisdom 

00:07:49.147 --> 00:07:52.019
 Although he is weak, to defeat the enemy. 

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:55.755
