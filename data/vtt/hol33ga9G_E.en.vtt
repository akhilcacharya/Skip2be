00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.474
 It is me, Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.160
 There are two things in this world that bothers me: Number one, the fact that the Tasmanian devil 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.040
 is on the verge of extinction due to a rapidly spreading facial cancer and you did not know it. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.326
 And number two, the fact that the guy in the leadership of the immunization effort to save the Tasmanian devil 

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:17.481
 never watched the Warner Brothers cartoon. 

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.081
 We have to solve these things. So today at Smarter Everyday we go to Tasmania 

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.560
 and I want the record that shows that within two hours an Alabama boy was on the ground, 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800
 we had a Tasmanian devil in a bag. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.469
 Let's be Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.229
 - This is Jocelyn, - Hi! 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.900
 - And this is Alex. - Hey. 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.200
 - Okay, so this facility is being held by the University of Tasmania, right? 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.368
 - That's right yes. 

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:43.940
 - And its purpose is to study a disease that is about to kill the Tasmanian Devils all over the island, right? 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.720
 - That's right. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.760
 (Destin) Welcome to ground zero in the fight against the extinction of an animal species. 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.980
 These people have put little smart pipe traps across the island to monitor the devils to better understand why they are dying. 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 (Destin) So the devil would come in here, grab the bait ... (Alex) And then you're pulled here, 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 (Destin) Pull the rope. (Alex) Pull the rope and the pin, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.020
 (Alex) And then this pin locks it so it can not open. 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.280
 (Destin) And at that moment you caught a devil. (Alex) That's right. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.041
 (Destin) Once you catch a devil in a pipe, you have to look into his mouth, so Alex agreed to show me 

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.600
 how they look into their mouths with one of the more manageable devils that keep them trapped. 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.180
 (Destin) So we are going to put a Tasmanian Devil in a jute bag, or as you call it, a bast fiber bag. (Alex) Yes, that's right. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.700
 (Destin) And we're going to check whether the .. (Alex) Well, he had this tumor 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.300
 (Alex) This DFTD tumor in the gums, on the gums, that is removed ... 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.020
 (Destin) DFTD. (Alex) That's right. Devil Facial Tumor Disease. (Devil Facial Tumor Disease) 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.340
 (Destin) Devil Facial Tumor Disease. Okay, so we are going to control 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 this tasmanian devil for the tumor. 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.614
 (Alex) Yes, so the tumor was removed two or three years ago, 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.200
 so we will only check whether the tumor has not grown back. (Destin) Okay. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860
 (Alex) So we're going to put him in the bag and see if he cooperates. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.840
 I can open his mouth and take a good look in his mouth or there is no tumor. 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.121
 (Destin) Beautiful. So I'm going to help you catch a tasmanian devil? (Alex) Yes, yes. 

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.500
 (Alex chuckles) 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.720
 (Destin) Where do you want me? (Alex) Well, if you can just hold the deskel in front of me. 

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:09.022
 (Alex) And if we can just .. 

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:10.760
 (Box creaks) 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.080
 (Destin) Woow. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.417
 (Box creaks) 

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:18.077
 (Destin) So you're just going to hold his head? 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.740
 Ohh, you're going to take his tail? 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.500
 (Destin) Okay, so we have to come to his mouth now. (Alex) Jup. Well, we will try. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.400
 (Destin) So we have a tasmanian devil in a bag. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 (Destin) Is it transferable to people? (Alex) No. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 (Destin) How do you know that? (Alex) A few people have been stabbed with syringes 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.160
 and no tumors have ever grown so .. 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920
 (Destin) Wow. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.160
 (Alex) So I cover more or less his eyes so he can not see, 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.640
 but I can come to his mouth 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.400
 (Destin) Where would the tumors sit? (Alex) I think that this tumor first 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.800
 on this side was here, but he has no sign of a tumor there now. 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.340
 (Destin) You really love them, do not you? (Alex) Yes. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.820
 (Alex) We do not have any signs that devils are becoming immune to the disease, 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.920
 so it seems that, where the disease comes, the population simply falls. By that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.260
 and when a devil gets DFTD, that devil, it does not survive. 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.740
 (Destin) Why did not I hear about this? A cancer with a 100% mortality probability. 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.384
 That is a huge thing! To get a better understanding, let's go to the University of Tasmania 

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:49.660
 and talking with Professor Greg Woods, who is working on a vaccination to beat it. 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.320
 (Prof. Woods) It is a tumor that occurs in Tasmanian devil and it starts on the face. 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720
 So it is called Devil's Face Tumor Disease. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440
 (Destin) And why is this a threat? (Prof. Woods) It is a threat because 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.460
 it is a very rare cancer. It is a contagious cancer and so far it has about eighty to ninety percent 

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:09.386
 of the remaining tasmanian devil population killed. 

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:12.280
 (Destin) Are you serious? In how long? (Prof. Woods) In less than 20 years. 

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:16.145
 (Destin) Wow! It almost killed it in 20 years. (Prof. Woods) It almost killed a complete animal species, yes. 

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:20.245
 (Destin) What is this you have on your screen here? (Prof. Woods) This is a map of the DFTD transfers. 

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:23.220
 So, it started in the most northeastern corner of Tasmania, 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.772
 and it has since moved to the south and west. 

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:29.052
 (Destin) So this is like the ripple of death. (Prof. Woods) The ripple of death, yes. 

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:31.637
 (Destin) You can see it going down on the island. (Prof. Woods) You can see it moving down on the island. 

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:34.117
 Every year it moves 10 to 20 kilometers. 

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:37.071
 (Destin) Can you show me what it does? Do you have a picture or something like that? 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.740
 (Destin) So this is a tasmanian devil's head? (Prof. Woods) This is a healthy devil. 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.200
 (Destin) Okay. (Prof. Woods) Now, the other half of this devil has a small tumor. 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.800
 Now, you can see the tumor there. So that's a very young tumor. 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.240
 (Prof. Woods) In a single devil, actually, it was a female devil ... 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.680
 (Destin) That would be patient zero, right? (Prof. Woods) What would the patient be? 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.738
 (Prof. Woods) It has gone from a single cell into a single devil to maybe 100,000 devils who have now been killed 

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.546
 because of this cancer. (Destin) Ohh, wow! 

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:12.800
 (Prof. Woods) So it's a clonal proliferation of ... (Destin) So it's already Levensweg, but with death. 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.900
 (Prof. Woods) The game of death, yes. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.820
 (Prof. Woods) Every devil who gets it will die from it. (Destin) Really? 

00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:20.468
 (Prof. Woods) It has a 100% mortality number. (Destin) What is the cause of death? 

00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:24.068
 (Prof. Woods) They just can not see so they are unable to eat. (Destin) So they starve to death. 

00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:26.688
 (Prof. Woods) So this is the healthy side. (Destin) Okay. 

00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:30.920
 (Prof. Woods) And this is the sick side. I do not know if you can see it right away, 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.640
 but you can see a hole here. The cancer cells produce enzymes that digest the bone 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.860
 and when we open the jaw ... (Destin) The canine is gone. 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.180
 (Prof. Woods) The canine is gone, so he obviously could not have eaten either. 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.480
 (Destin) That is amazing. (Prof. Woods) And these fangs are what 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.026
 they bite each other. So they will bite another devil ... (Destin) Ohh, so that tooth will get infected. 

00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:02.306
 (Prof. Woods) This tooth yes. This tooth will have cancer cells in itself, okay? (Destin) Wow. 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.040
 (Prof. Woods) So what would happen is, a few cancer cells there. He will bite the other devil and transfer a number of tumor cells. 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.599
 Greg says they transmit the disease by biting into each other's face. What is very bad news for the 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.252
 tasmanian devil because all the locals told me that that's how they say hello. 

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.920
 I wanted to verify this for myself so I went to the local zoo 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.920
 and maybe or maybe not lowered my camera in the loft. Do not collapse it. 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.460
 (Tasmanian devil is sniffing) 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 (Destin) Well, this explains how you guys are transferring DFTD ... Wow! 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.320
 Okay, so I learn. So they transfer DFTD, Devil Facial Tumor Disease, by biting each other. 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.011
 Look at this, I put my camera towards them. 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.280
 This is just what they do. They just bite. 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.320
 All the time. 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.026
 Why are you biting my camera? 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.600
 Do not you know you're getting cancer? 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
 (Used on plastic) Wooh! 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.740
 Watch out for those cameras. Get those cameras up. Yes, do not do that, you will lose the camera. 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.200
 You will lose the lens and everything. 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.800
 (Destin) Will they eat it? (Animal caretaker) Nothing over the edge. (Destin) Okay, thank you !. 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.433
 (Destin) How do you try to beat the cancer? What is the mechanism? What are you doing? 

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:27.153
 (Prof. Woods) Well the ultimate mechanism is to produce a vaccination. So we have to understand that 

00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:31.254
 understand the immune system of the devils, we must understand the tumor, 

00:07:31.254 --> 00:07:35.414
 we need to know how to make the tumor more visible to the devils their immune system. 

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:38.549
 (Destin) These men are not just talking. They make huge discoveries. 

00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:43.991
 DFTD is a specific type of cancer that affects cells in the nervous system called Schwann cells. 

00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:48.810
 For their research, human Schwann cells cancer were super rare and often misdiagnosed. 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.290
 I will let these men explain how they have done what might well save someone you love in the future. 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.130
 (Scientist) The normal cells compared to the cancer cells. (Destin) Wow, so you've actually identified the border here. That is interesting. 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:05.537
 (Scientist) Yes, because we have a marker for the tumor so it will only stain the DFTD cancer cells. 

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:09.520
 (Destin) Have you made the marker for the tumor? (Scientist) We have discovered the marker. 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440
 (Destin) You discovered the marker? (Scientist) Yes, we did. 

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.720
 (Destin) How long ago did you do that? (Scientist) That was about three years ago. (Prof. Woods) Three years ago. 

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:22.168
 (Destin) Other cancers, like human cancers, would not it stain? (Prof. Woods) It would spot human Schwann cell cancers, yes. 

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:27.342
 (Prof. Woods) We discovered this in the devil and we actually got it working on human cancers, so that will help with diagnosing. 

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:34.375
 (Destin) Wow! So you discovered this staining method for the tasmanian devil and have this 

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:37.692
 research applied in medical research for people. (Prof. Woods) Yes, yes. 

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:39.830
 (Prof. Woods) It's only a way to .. (Destin) Do you know what this is? Yes! 

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.630
 (Destin) That's a good thing! That is amazing. (Prof. Woods) It all comes together. (Destin) That's great. 

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.870
 (Destin) I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day. I stand on it can do a very sincere advertisement. 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.222
 I want to express my thanks to the sponsor of this video. This is Harrys.com. They make razors 

00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:57.217
 and I used them long before they decided to sponsor Smarter Every Day but the fact that they 

00:08:57.217 --> 00:09:02.657
 Sponsoring Smarter Every Day is quite impressive. They could sponsor well-known bloggers and things. She 

00:09:02.657 --> 00:09:09.449
 sponsors a guy who goes to Tasmania to talk about a disease that affects an animal species. That is cool! 

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:14.869
 Thank you Harry's. If you are interested in buying a razor, go to harrys.com and use the promo code "smarter". I think 

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:19.206
 That it's worth it. I am going to use a portion of this sponsorship to make a personal donation to it 

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:22.921
 Devil Facial Tumor Disease research fund at the University of Tasmania by going to the links in the 

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:28.135
 video description. So please consider doing the same thing. I want the knowledge about Devil's Face Tumor 

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:34.742
 Disease will spread faster than the disease itself so please also consider to share the video. If this gave meaning 

00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:39.883
 consider your life to subscribe to Smarter Every day or not, whatever. Thank you very much, I'm Destin, 

00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.617
 you will continue Smarter Every Day, good day. 

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:46.537
 (Prof. Woods) And every philanthropist there, this is an absolutely perfect project to be involved. 

00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:49.240
 Actually saving a species. Can you imagine that? (Destin) Yes. 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.600
 (Prof. Woods) Saving an animal species. (Destin) That's cool. 

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.760
 (Destin) It struck me that there is not a single tasmanian devil cartoon on the wall, anywhere else here. 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.760
 I expected that when I walked inside. (Prof. Woods) No, no, actually I've never even seen the cartoon. 

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.800
 (Destin) Do not you have that? (Prof. Woods) I have not seen it. I saw a picture of it. 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.960
 (Destin) Are you serious? (Prof. Woods) I have never looked at the cartoon. 

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.720
 (Destin) And you're the man she's trying to save. (Prof. Woods) I have never looked at the cartoon, no. 

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.000
 (Destin) He has never seen the Tasmanian devil cartoon. (Prof. Woods) I have not seen it. 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.146
 (Prof. Woods) Do you have it .. (Jocelyn) Are you serious? 

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.435
 (Prof. Woods) Seriously! What would I look at the cartoon for? 

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:18.389
 (Destin) I do not want to force you to watch it. 

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:22.052
 (Prof. Woods) I am a nerd, hey, I do not watch cartoons. (Laughter) 

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:27.453
 (Destin) Greg is too proud to watch the Tasmanian devil cartoon even though he is the man in the world who is trying to save them. 

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:29.155
 That is very interesting. 

00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:32.841
 (Sound of the tasmanian devil cartoon) 

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.480
 (Prof. Woods) Is that it? 

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.560
 (Destin) That's it. That is the tasmanian devil. 

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.800
 (Laughter) You never saw it? 

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.240
 (Prof. Woods) So what is his role in life?
