00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 Hi, this is me Dustin: Welcome to the smartest every day. 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.260
 Maybe you've run the power switch thousands of times in your life, right? 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.520
 Do you know that roar when life comes to life in the engine? 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.820
 Have you ever thought about what happens inside the engine? 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.640
 Think about it, you have thousands of explosions 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.779
 Every minute and all unite 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.459
 To make one unified voice 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 Well today in the smartest every day, I want to learn what 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.540
 Occurs in each disc. 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.460
 We can look at it to blow up 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.840
 Produces inside the combustion chamber in the transparent potato gun bar 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.520
 But for years I wanted to see inside the engine works 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.640
 Today in the smartest every day today will see it 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.059
 Someone posted on the smartest page every day 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 There is a channel called 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.070
 King Road 805 which did exactly what I mentioned 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.410
 Transparent motor. So I took it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.770
 High-speed camera and we went to Cinnaminson - New Jersey to meet Everett 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.909
 This sounds like the right place 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 Hey Everett? He's Dustin. What's News 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 I'm Dustin. how are you? please enter .. 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.680
 We were about to contact you because Telefonati was unemployed .. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.940
 Welcome! How are you doing? I'm Dustin. It's good to meet you 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.900
 how are you? Very good. I am honored to meet you 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.140
 Oh, you have a music! (jukebox) 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 Did you like it? It's 1953 issue 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.860
 that's cool. that's cool. 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.400
 I'll let you take her picture later 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 (Laughs) What are you doing, guys? Is this the workshop? 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.820
 This is my friend 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.220
 (Dustin) Oh, her smell of freedom 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.300
 This is Everett. He works with his friend Mike 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.340
 To make all kinds of small mechanical miracles 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 Their specialty is to disassemble a single cylinder of Briggs and Starton engines from the 1950s 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.640
 And convert them to many other things 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 For example, this one is run to hit and miss the engine. Which is really hard to do. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 This one is the absolute Frankenstein. They took four single cylinder engines, 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.520
 Chopped off, and put them together to make one four-cylinder engine that runs like a small kitten. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 Something amazing! 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.640
 (Mike): The solicitation is actually here (pointing). (D): And you welded that !? (M): Yes, there is --- 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.220
 (D): How do you weld four engines together and then they have aligned that crankshaft can go there? 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.260
 (Mike, humbled): It took a long time to do. 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.380
 If you do not really appreciate what I'm saying here, 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.400
 Just understand these guys do very difficult things with very simple tools. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.640
 They perform mainly mechanical magic. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 That is why I wanted to see ... this. 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 This is it, huh? 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.060
 love it. 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.540
 (Voice): on the normal Briggs and Stratton engine, 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.800
 The lighter is right in the middle on top of the cylinder, 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.100
 It was launched by a magnet that moves past the coil. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.200
 These guys move the lighter so you can see down in the engine 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.940
 Came with a clever way to shoot with a coil of buzz from the 1920s. 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.620
 They also run a cylinder for propane gas instead of gasoline 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.440
 It is cleaner and makes the engine longer. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
 Now we understand that this is the basis of the normal engine 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.160
 They had taken the metal head out of and replaced it with an acrylic head, 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740
 Set his time to get the high-speed camera up 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.120
 We see one thing I've wanted to see for years 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520
 - Explosion inside engine. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.800
 (D): I can not tell you how excited I am about this mount camera you built 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.660
 (Laughs) as she raises her engine. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.860
 It's like, this is the most pleasing thing I have ever seen. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.720
 (M): I just run it. 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.900
 (D, voice commentary): Well this is a beautiful and launch, 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.440
 But I want to understand exactly what is going on. 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.680
 We have a piston on the left, moving up and down inside the cylinder, 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.460
 Two valves on the right. 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.600
 Let's take a look at how the 4-stroke engine works, 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800
 And count off all four strokes with me. 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.360
 The first thing that happens is one of the valves on the right open, 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.020
 Allow the fuel mixture and air to be drawn into the cylinder. 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.040
 This is called stroke intake. 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.660
 When the piston gets near the bottom of the cylinder, 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.460
 Close the pull valve, and then start the piston to press the gas. 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.640
 This is called a pressure stroke. 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.100
 The third stroke is a beautiful one. 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.120
 This is called power stroke 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 Explosion occurs and increases the pressure inside the cylinder 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.700
 It applies the force to face the plunger pushed it down. 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.180
 When all these gases have been burned after the third stroke, the exhaust valve then opens 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.700
 A fourth stroke is called an exhaust stroke to wipe the cylinder from all those exhaust gases. 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.520
 The pull valve then opens the backup, and the process starts over and over again. 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 Timing is everything in the engine to make sure it works properly. For example we want to make sure 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.170
 The spark occurs before the piston is at the top of the dead center 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.780
 You want to press in order to build up at the same time as the piston is ready to start moving down. 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.980
 When you hear a person talk about pushing or discouraging the timing of the engine 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.580
 The timing of the spark is what we are talking about. 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.840
 If you are really looking closely you can see this part happen before the piston reaches the top of the stroke. 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.180
 I asked Everett and Mike if they would not dare run the gasoline engine for me 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.620
 Because I wanted to see a brighter torch. I was really excited when they said yes. 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.530
 I was more impressed when they said they could change the engine mode in just over seconds 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.800
 (D): So we already converted, like finished it? (M): That's it 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 (D): That was fast 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.440
 (D): The guy who is good there. 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.270
 (D, voiceover): Ok now that you know how the engines work, watch all of the four strokes and see if you can recognize each one. 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.560
 Accommodating 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.320
 pressure 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.420
 Energy 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.000
 exhaust 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.320
 Compression exhaust intake power 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.690
 Now think about the engine in your car all the blasts are synchronized together to make this 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.460
 One fixed sound roaring engine. 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.330
 I think what was found is really refreshing in making this video you've got Everett who retired 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.740
 He got Mike and Bill who came later 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.120
 Shop and help us out these guys 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.250
 Generations are quite different however 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.630
 They work together to 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.240
 They completely love engines in, such as, 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.100
 Absolutely the way to apologize it 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.940
 Beautiful 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.960
 Anyway I'll leave the links in the video 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.370
 Description for all of YouTube 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.320
 Channels I would enjoy it if you are 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.880
 You will consider the subscription. They're small 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.000
 Channels this kind of thing will really help out 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.220
 (D): Great thanks to 805 Rod King for 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.350
 Help me imagine an engine for that, thank you very much 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.320
 Bill, Everett, Mike, was a blast 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.850
 (Everett): This is dirtbike5100 and SmallEngineMechanic (D): Oh yeah, there you go 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.500
 These guys have all the YouTube channels 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.790
 I'll leave the links in the video description 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.160
 I hope you enjoy this episode of the program 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.660
 The intelligence of each day was sponsored 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.190
 Audio and book I'm about to 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.320
 Recommend means a lot to me you 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.180
 You know Everett and Mike have this you know 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.040
 Relationship though their ages are 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.030
 Completely different 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.770
 My father recommended that I read this book 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.330
 It has long been wonderful 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.880
 It's about a young man trying to figure out 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.220
 Of its way in the world and 12th 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.700
 Century Europe after taking his father 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.170
 We'll say I do not want to give 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.030
 Anything away but called it (audible narrator): Drum walking Louis L'Amour 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.520
 (D): This is John Curless 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.350
 And he does a good job reading this dang 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.600
 Book I enjoyed it. It's a very thick book I can not 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.130
 Really sit down and read these like me 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.740
 Used to be able to but with audio books 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.480
 I can hear it back and forth on my own 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.430
 Drive I've even heard it while like Bush 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.560
 Shear area I really enjoyed this 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.140
 A book full of wonderful quotes that 

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.970
 The fair wisdom I really enjoyed it 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.870
 Please get this book at audible.com / 

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.030
 Smarter than there behind the scenes 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.740
 The video on the second channel goes to 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.210
 The timing of this engine is how 

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.310
 Modified to all acrylic shape 

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.080
 That stuff is cool 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:20.680
 We just decide on how to fix it with 

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:30.099
 The back pressure that it just needs is backwards 

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:35.280
 Pressure
