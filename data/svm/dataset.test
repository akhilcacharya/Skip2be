0	Sup you beautiful bastards. Hope even a fantastic Thursday, welcome back to the Philip DeFranco Show, and let's just jump into it?	0.0
0	And the first thing I want to talk about today is actually a story about a person I used to include in my thumbnails as clickbait, Kate Upton was in the news.	0.006555784873133423
0	You may have seen on January 31st, Kate Upton alluded to fashion brand Guess' co-founder Paul Marciano assaulting her.	0.01241248836550524
0	She tweeted out, "It's disappointing that such an iconic women's brand Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director,	0.018149811824693458
0	hashtag Me Too." Also posting an image of her tweet on her Instagram with the caption,	0.024098579579944154
0	"He shouldn't be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women, hashtag Me Too."	0.02816559426975841
0	Now Upton didn't immediately elaborate on what happened but	0.03352757881105581
0	her statement had an immediate effect on the fashion brand. Within hours of her initial tweet, Guess' shares dropped by more than 17 percent.	0.03581400995508073
0	Now, obviously keep in mind this happened during that dip in the stock market, but 17 percent is a whole lot more than 4 percent.	0.04208652017320222
0	Marciano has responded to Upton's post, giving TMZ a one-page statement	0.048500667718829674
0	Saying he never touched up dinner was alone with her	0.05226417384970256
0	And that he has built a brand with a quote "long, and proud history of empowering women", also noting Upton's timing her,	0.05432702035530735
0	saying, "She leveled this malicious and false accusation only hours before a gala event at our headquarters in Los Angeles unveiling a new guest campaign."	0.059759823560357736
0	Also, saying he felt Upton statements provided no facts, no details, no dates, and no circumstances to corroborate her allegations.	0.06618509975314638
0	So then yesterday Upton provides details, dates, circumstances, and witnesses in a Time article	0.07213386750839706
0	Upton says that on the first day of her lingerie issue with Guess, Marciano forcibly grabbed her breasts.	0.07723281129861195
0	He kissed her against her will, he grabbed her thighs and arms to pull closer so he could smell her.	0.0818866092023795
0	He also allegedly told photographer Yu Tsai to leave the room so he could, be alone with Upton. Tsai has also corroborated Upton's story.	0.0862368985472057
0	Following that, she said, "Then Paul insisted that he walk me up to my hotel room. I immediately declined."	0.09242847314960949
0	"The only thing I was thinking is 'If he touches me like that in public, I can't imagine what he tried to do in private'."	0.09714297276516531
0	"Thankfully, Yu Tsai stepped in and insisted he do it."	0.10129092307069726
0	"I was so relieved and I felt like I had barely escaped."	0.10379992715794585
0	And following all of this, Kate said the harassment assault made her reconsider her career saying,	0.10590425316660597
0	"It took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth. I wanted to quit modeling. I constantly blamed myself after it happened.	0.10948565416211403
0	What am i doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that? I wondered if it was how i was presenting myself or what i was wearing.	0.1145643640483995
0	I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size, wearing baggy, clothes, started despising my own body."	0.12002751810934402
0	But then calling on the industry to change, saying,	0.1250455262838412
0	"The culture of complacency and tolerance in our industry needs to stop.	0.12729148962000728
0	People know what is going on and have previously accepted it and we can't always require the victims to be the ones	0.1300635344583384
0	to speak up and tell their story, because the victims only know their one story."	0.13447452551495284
0	And as far as where we are now, before Upton's Time interview,	0.1381166282222492
0	Guess said that they, would launch an investigation if she provided concerns that were determined to have merit.	0.1407875035409332
0	And so most likely what we're about to see is an investigation.	0.14485451823074744
0	Then let's talk about the failing New, York Times. The New York Times, who you may have heard are failing.	0.1473432884140666
0	I don't know if you've heard about this, people are saying it.	0.1529480798025171
0	Well the company came out with an announcement today and it really shows the big shift in news media.	0.1548703006758124
0	The company announced today that in 2017, they brought in 1.7 billion dollars and that's also a big deal for a few reasons:	0.15988830885030958
0	one, as a total that is an eight percent increase from 2016,	0.1665250293391607
0	two, a huge part of this is due to a surge in the number of people subscribing to their digital-only content,	0.1700457286228805
0	and three, thanks to an increase in digital advertising	0.17563028610740156
0	Subscriptions now reportedly account for 60% of their revenue; just in the last quarter 157,000 digital-only subscriptions were added.	0.1784427987535915
0	But also if there's something that kind of brings this story back down to earth let's talk	0.1861316822467727
0	About profit as reportedly operating profit dropped, from fifty six million for the quarter to twenty three million this they	0.18956132896281008
0	Say reportedly due to pension settlement charges and higher operating costs as	0.19541904415037836
0	Well as just on the print side a lot of their numbers drop but really all this story shows	0.19912083687426652
0	Is what most millennials and younger know?	0.20303710897980656
0	And that is the future is digit, also in this current climate people care	0.20528307231597265
0	About news, more than ever i used to joke about in the past but one of the biggest things to come	0.208925175023269
0	From the trump administration and the election in general is that people care about, new	0.21232447088341225
0	Seven-days-a-week used to die over the weekend and for me the only question is do we get to a point	0.21576322285621788
0	Where print media in general	0.22039779855125247
0	dies out and it goes all digit or will there be	0.2218940957468334
0	Holdouts - there's reading an actual physical copy of a newspaper become a gimmick in the future i don't know	0.2244445793371373
0	But it'll be very interesting to see then let's talk, about this situation with holocaust denier and republican candidate arthur	0.2298065638784347
0	Jones, now before you just take, that headline you start saying see all republicans are nazis, this situations a little complicated	0.23581603334547369

0	Insurance agent and holocaust denier are they just really quick that description escalates very quickly like we're talking about arthur	0.2434745659827607
0	Jones, who of course loves bubblegum and is the former leader of the american nazi	0.24944356764194084
0	Party, also that that lasting stories is the former leader of the american nazi	0.2536926874671199
0	Party i don't know, about the bubblegum, but, who doesn't like, bubblegum	0.25763829873335764
0	That said this same guy is running as a republican for this midterm election	0.26018777062846504
0	In illinois some of arthur jones's greatest hits include a section on his web	0.2643539314475335
0	With a flier titled the holocaust racket saying there is no proof such a so-called holocaust ever took place anywhere in europe against	0.26884788151025857
0	The jews millions of dollars are made each, year by the jews telling this tall tale of woe and misfortune?	0.27579822751001576
0	also	0.28044089676662215

0	Pride and white resistance it is the flag of a, white	0.289546153534863
0	Counter-revolution, also this month when talking to the chicago, sun-times he gave props to hitler for his economic policies economic policies of hitler	0.29253166605964953

0	He doesn't support interracial marriages the	0.3097001335437659
0	integration of schools	0.31210796811136743
0	There's more and more we could include here but you get you get the point so the question for many of course is how	0.3130488446440856
0	The, hell, did this guy, become the republican candidate	0.3178038120675003
0	Well it's because he's running in a district where democrats have a lock on the seat democrats have, won the seat every election since	0.3199880619966816
0	1975 the last time a republican ran, which, was back in 2014 democrat won 64 percent to 35 percent so essentially what happened	0.32515883614584595
0	Is that a republican, was not going to run, and then arthur, jones just said	0.332220468617215
0	Yeah i'll, do it jones actually tried to do this back in 2016 but the illinois election	0.33583120877342076

0	jones's petition and determined that the signatures were	0.3486696208166404
0	Legitimate and so jones could not be kept off the ballot but it is important to note the republican party is not endorsing	0.3509267127999676
0	This, guy, you!	0.3561065922059002
0	also	0.3568046618914653
0	Gathering, jones stated that he regretted voting for donald trump or in his words	0.362034114362025
0	And once again the republican party wants nothing to do with him so i just want to cover this story for a few reasons the	0.3704413014447007
0	First is a lot of misinformation saying this guy, is representative republicans general know	0.3754390757152685
0	Publicans have denounced and pointed out he has no real connection to the gop, he's been running for a	0.379760025899397
0	While he's just looking for any way in which is why - at least from a pr standpoint it might	0.38366415766257944
0	Make, sense for the parties to even even in districts where it looks like	0.38736696208166405
0	They, have zero chance whatsoever just just put up like a pizza	0.3901299016632269
0	Boy, you know just so monster mccade slaw doesn't get voted in as your candidate and you have that attachment	0.3933774432438995

0	Days, or whatever i'm excited and we got this really interesting video from Seeker about squishy batteries explaining how they work	0.4683440573024159
0	Then, we have Life Noggin covering "How long will our monuments last"	0.4748694913196552

0	and if you want to see the full versions of everything I just shared, the secret link of the day	0.49103638055926513
0	anything at all, links, as always, are in the description down below	0.4940512322447493
0	Then very quickly let's talk about YouTube and Logan Paul	0.4972077212577395
0	Who you may just be sick of seeing his face, which actually is part of the story	0.5000404678078588
0	So of course after massive controversy, fallout, Logan Paul has done his redemption tour, he's posting videos again	0.504532394480191
0	But something that happened around that, is when Logan Paul returned a lot of people got a notification	0.5101371858686415
0	saying "Hey! Logan Paul's back!"	0.5144874752134677
0	but the thing that made a lot of people angry is a lot of people who are not subscribed to Logan Paul	0.5163894621828335
0	got that message	0.5214074703573307
0	One of the tweets that blew up around this came from Rachel Monday	0.5225608028813079
0	Who tweeted, "Are you kidding me @YouTube!?"	0.5246034154829833
0	"I'm having a hard time receiving accurate notifications from my actual subscribed channels and this crap pops up!?"	0.5261209582776901
0	"I've never once clicked a video of his... at least try to hid the favoritism..."	0.5303508558941362
0	and then YouTube's official account responds	0.5335882805228441
0	"Our bad! We fixed it so that only Logan subscribers will get it going forward. Apologies for the spam!"	0.5356319048197159
0	So the question becomes "Why did it happen? Was it a bug or was it a setting?"	0.5400631297802598
0	and the reason I say setting is part of this seems to be a built in system	0.5435231273521913
0	YouTube's quick response of Oh, fixed it! it was just supposed to go to these people, that makes me think setting	0.5470235927319818
0	because Youtube's a massive website, whenever they have to do a fix it is a massive undertaking, in fact they were saying that	0.5515752094209057
0	Was supposed to target a specific group of people that subscribe to logan paul if they have that ability to push through recommendations	0.5568471530897171
0	like that	0.5623801141192182
0	Did they maybe accidentally do it to everyone that had tags for logan paul idea being that if this system exists in this way	0.563159119420501
0	And they were trying to help logan paul that the algorithm, would just go	0.5689267937355833
0	Oh, this person watched a bunch of logan paul videos not considering that maybe watch the video of like, oh my	0.5722036744769536
0	God i can't believe logan paul did this what a scumbag look, he, was really offensive here based off of a tag push	0.5769384079964388
0	Youtube's like, oh they, love logan paul they're, gonna love his new video something that may not be the biggest	0.582310509489701
0	Deal if it's just something on your homepage when	0.5857705070616325
0	You're!	0.5875915584152807
0	For it it's a little more aggressive that could potentially explain it or it may have been a bug	0.5884514993322811
0	And the tags might be where there's a lot of overlap because not only does logan paul use his	0.5921745376552953
0	Own tags in any video that was even remotely talking about this incident they, use many of the same tag but	0.5955131318036502
0	No, matter the explanation i understand why, people are frustrated especially when youtubers have	0.6000657601877706
0	To, deal with other issues then there is a subject of youtube favoritism and really we're only, gonna be able to tell based	0.6036168103273846
0	Off of their actions moving forward obviously it's hard for many to not see this recommended move as a	0.6078052284407753
0	Coordinated effort between paul and ut there have, also been murmurs in the community that logan paul's project	0.6120037635061308
0	that	0.6168194326413338
0	Of other youtubers, who, have had scandals in the past like with a lot of the stories	0.6225567561005221
0	We have to wait and see it's one thing to say, something it's a	0.6254087248593744

0	Was in bogota yesterday said i don't know	0.9266419813038728
0	That i would say, we are better prepared because the russians will adapt as	0.928463032657521
0	Well the point is if it's their intention to interfere they are, going to find ways to do that, we can, take steps	0.9314374165351463
0	We can, take but this	0.9356865363603254
0	Is something that once they decide they're going to do it it's very difficult to preempt it i think it's important	0.9367781554773178

0	We do see it and you need to stop if you don't you're, going to just continue to invite consequences for yourself	0.9443051677390636
0	Well i will say it's great that our secretary of state is saying it also appears there's a disconnect between him	0.9491623163773218
0	And trump whether it is tweet it's a seemingly mainly focus on collusion, which that's not what i'm talking	0.9540184533203836

0	glass panel on the front can slide out	0.09845489013005014
0	I'm not going to do it right now because	0.10775001019201762
0	prototype case and stuff but it can	0.11324962289534836
0	slide out and you can put in a mesh	0.12059195238289372

0	airflow it's fine don't worry about it	0.1368584124913368

0	does also have mesh on each side and	0.15593786946063842
0	along the top so that these four big	0.1647437726772392
0	fans can all breathe properly even if	0.17428350116189

0	they're not filtered but they will be	0.19776590973949204
0	filtered once you guys are able to get	0.20571568347670105
0	it into your hands I have been told for	0.21207550246646825
0	front IO its kind of front slash top IO	0.21806433201516573
0	the power button is the Coolermaster	0.22895348363161971
0	logo but with no text in it nice and	0.23788169105956214
0	subtle and it has an illuminated ring	0.24473072689469608
0	around it to the right of that you've	0.25243589220922175
0	got a hard drive activity led to the	0.2589180154103306
0	left of that you have headphone and	0.2655183660157365
0	microphone jacks and then above you have	0.2720045660238901
0	tons of USB which is great to see you	0.27983203554975744
0	have four USB three type-a ports and one	0.2908394145705084
0	USB type-c port which is awesome I'm	0.3015981083615312
0	happy that cases are starting to have	0.3112642178645685
0	these on the front because you're	0.31640099474091893
0	starting to see more c2c cables out	0.32190468425129437
0	there in the wild which is really cool	0.32960984956582007
0	moving on to the inside of the case the	0.33572506013290393
0	main notable part that you're gonna see	0.34452688654245994
0	is the power supply shroud it's been	0.3511353907619552
0	around for a while now but this one does	0.35957438134453096
0	have a cutout again been around for a	0.3658078193159118
0	while now but this one is illuminated	0.3760854498756574
0	which is cool and there's the subtle	0.38427575522850504
0	outside halo logo as well I kind of	0.39394186473154225
0	maybe suggested that they also include a	0.4086142932854988
0	blank in the case just like how they had	0.4184027069998777
0	the mesh front they would have some swap	0.42671939337111175
0	ability for you and we'll we'll see what	0.4338089608218843
0	happens there just in case you have a	0.44482041664968
0	different brand of power supply or you	0.4505687145827388
0	want to orientate it in a different way	0.4571731419951894
0	or something else there's also the	0.4621835378531534
0	ever-popular option to mount your	0.4708712136654572
0	graphics card vertically so if you don't	0.4782053895389131
0	have two cards like they have in this	0.4878714990419503
0	setup which is beautiful by the way but	0.49581719597211465
0	if you don't have two cards you want to	0.5045048717844185
0	have one and you want to display the	0.5103713971217743
0	really cool part of the card which you	0.5179542582249582
0	rarely actually get to see which is at	0.5238248603693587
0	the side with the fans on it you	0.5306738962044927
0	mounted vertically you might have also	0.5378123853398019
0	noticed that the lighting in the room	0.5455175506543275
0	has changed quite a bit while I've been	0.5522402054710751
0	hosting this video that is in sync with	0.5579925802111786
0	what's on screen it's called screen	0.5672877002731461
0	follow it has to do with their master	0.5742590403196217
0	Plus lighting control basically anything	0.5819642056341473
0	that can connect through Wi-Fi or the	0.5922377593868482
0	internet in your house or a 4-pin which	0.5994537078560072
0	like fans in the case and whatnot can	0.609360348974683
0	all sync together and follow your screen	0.6180439479799421
0	or just be set to one color whatever you	0.627950589098618
0	kind of want to do we even had something	0.6372457091605854
0	earlier	0.6436055281503527
0	where they brought paint up on the	0.6456846997431611
0	screen and then just made the whole	0.6505768681968283
0	paint a different color and all the	0.6575482082433038
0	lights in the room wouldn't follow that	0.6678217619960047
0	color it was pretty cool it's nice	0.6738146683517469
0	because with traditional setups they're	0.6826205715683477
0	all separate the Nano Leafs might be one	0.6900770516531453
0	one mode your computer might be on	0.6998654653675241
0	another mode other lighting in the room	0.7062252843572914
0	might be in another mode it gets kind of	0.712829711769742
0	messy and you have all these different	0.7193118349708508
0	controllers and need to sync everything	0.7239593950018346
0	up and the not great with this setup	0.7298259203391904
0	it's all done through your computer you	0.7415712014350361
0	can nicely set it up on your desktop	0.7493945941538587
0	it's all handled it's all in one	0.7549023604712789
0	solution better that way	0.762852134208488
0	and last but not least let's jump behind	0.7678666068734967
0	the motherboard panel we did already	0.775445391169636
0	mention that there's tempered glass back	0.7826654164458396
0	here but a good pair for tempered glass	0.7881691059562151
0	behind another word panel is good cable	0.7983162786905296
0	management because if you have messy	0.8071262587141751
0	cables back there it's kind of a	0.8133637734926006
0	negative to have a tempered glass panel	0.8204574177504179
0	so they handle all of that for you which	0.8274246809898488
0	is really cool they have big panels	0.8350116189000775
0	covering up all the messy cables so you	0.8421052631578947
0	don't have to worry about it which is a	0.8485873863590037

0	What is your takeaway from this story?	0.966953136128389
0	It is from last week to this week the story has seemingly evolved from this is a story about domestic abuse	0.9690541759650539
0	This is the story about a potential cover-up and people in the White House lying to the public and that's where I'm going to end	0.9751436304069132

0	'Sup, You beautiful bastards, hope you're havin' a fantastic Friday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and if you're new here on Fridays	0.0
0	we do things a little bit different.	0.005612310401115126
0	I try to cover more viewer requested stories, stories that I wanted to cover this week	0.006575206793463309
0	but then because of the sake of time we didn't get to film it. So with that said, let's just jump into it.	0.009757350109128258
0	And the first thing we're going to talk about today is something that I feel proves that we are in one of the weirder	0.013407185958219468
0	timelines and that is because we are getting news about the White House from a reality TV show called	0.017570566549896374
0	Celebrity Big Brother. And this situation revolves around our Omarosa Manigault-Newman.	0.022614309557434476
0	Most who know about her call her Omarosa, she was on The Apprentice several times which of course was Donald Trump's reality show.	0.026154100104543037
0	Then, during the election, she was involved with Donald Trump again.	0.03116116134475359
0	During the RNC she said she had been named director of African-American outreach for their campaign	0.033747225941345854
0	In December of 2016, she was named as one of nine people on Donald Trump's transition team.	0.037488766208755936
0	Then in early 2017, she was brought on to be part of Trump's White House staff.	0.0414687379637951
0	And her specific title ended up being assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of public liaison.	0.04423821139702511
0	But that was then and this is now and we're living in a post Omarosa White House.	0.04875006877831374
0	In December of last year it was announced that she was "resigning". There are a lot of reports that said otherwise but sure.	0.052509949929387595
0	And now we are in February and Omarosa has now come back to reality TV, but this time on Celebrity Big Brother.	0.05719604570548209
0	It's the first time they're doing it in the States and Omarosa has already made national headlines.	0.06272582213011023
0	So if you're not familiar with the show consider yourself lucky. I am for some reason addicted to Big Brother.	0.06679749830346826
0	I don't know why. I don't care about these people once the show is over.	0.07106175375529593
0	I mean they're watching the live feeds most season for some reason. And whoever's in the house is being filmed at all times.	0.07359279570089687
0	There's cameras everywhere. And so this conversation between Omarosa and Ross Matthews gets filmed and Big Brother then just puts it out.	0.07791207380371586
0	He's talking about her time at the White House and she says this,	0.08381783834345138
0	" 'I felt like it was like a call to duty, I felt like I was serving my country, not serving him.	0.08579865377913908
0	Whenever was it-- I'm accepting a political appointment, it was always about the country.	0.09073235148469454
0	Like I was haunted by tweets every single day, like what does he go to tweet next.'	0.09722502430167085
0	'Does anybody say to him,	0.10171854079929571
0	what are you doing?'	0.10321240577371017
0	'And I tried to be that person and then all the people around him attacked me. It was like 'keep her away from him,	0.10489151367312877
0	don't give her access, don't let her talk to him'.	0.11099902793316582
0	It's not my circus, not my monkeys.	0.11364011518074942
0	You know I'd like to say about my problem, but I can't say that because	0.11549254443079067
0	like it's bad.'	0.12058213964748822
0	'Should we be worried?'	0.1265245859545513
0	'Don't say that...'	0.1315591585202575
0	'Cuz we are worried, but I need you to say no it's gonna be okay.' 'No. It's gonna not be okay'	0.13388845074555691
0	'It's not.'	0.13854703519615574
0	'It's so bad.' "	0.14586504777800194
0	And so there were two main reactions to this;	0.14665370577554426
0	one being 'Holy shit, this is terrifying!'	0.14799259028299983
0	and the other being 'This is just Omarosa putting on a show. She's angry at the White House for kicking her out.	0.15052363222860077
0	She wants people to buy her book. This, this is just a show.'	0.1544669222163124
0	Then in response to this and a question about the White House's reaction	0.15741980448618015
0	to what Omarosa said, deputy press secretary Raj Shah said this,	0.16026264145406527
0	"What is the White House's reaction to comments made by former White House aide Omarosa on Celebrity Big Brother where she said quote	0.16371072758285493
0	'She is haunted by the president's tweets'. She described the situation inside the White House as bad and said it is not going to be okay	0.1695247877042716
0	Not very seriously. Omarosa was fired three times on The Apprentice, and this is the fourth time we let her go	0.17744804944702236
0	She had limited contact with the president while here. She has no contact now."	0.1842158355189553
0	So, one they're dismissing what she's saying	0.18782898960071898
0	and two, now they're being very straightforward and saying that she was fired.	0.18971810061808778
0	And as far as where the situation is right now because she doesn't have	0.19215743814536984
0	documentation, the people that want to believe it are gonna believe it, the people they don't want to believe it, they're not going to.	0.19468848009097078
0	And my personal reaction to this is I don't know what to believe because the source of this	0.19843002035838087
0	information the source of this story is Omarosa. She's a reality TV star veteran that knows how to use the platform,	0.20139207307008053
0	she knew that there were cameras on, her first jump was to go back into reality television	0.20619738458998954
0	where cameras were on at all points where she could whisper things that she wanted to get attention.	0.21004805311519908
0	So this kind of news coming out in a whisper conversation, that's going to have a big impact.	0.21436824826220127
0	Promo and strategy aside, that doesn't mean necessarily that she's lying about what's coming out of her mouth.	0.21827485648258532
0	Now does that guarantee that everything coming in our mouth is a lie, no	0.22254828237624488
0	but it does make me skeptical. But I will say it is kind of funny that she's putting herself in this position now	0.22489591548520807
0	considering what she said back in 2016 which if you do not remember. I shall read.	0.22953615905214314
0	"It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get into the White House, we know where we stand."	0.2327824954606313
0	She then alluded to there being a list of enemies adding,	0.23734937549291124
0	"Every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump."	0.23949525888157291
0	"It's everyone who has ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him."	0.2427232544063973
0	"It's the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe."	0.24611631788419566
0	But with that said I do want to pass the question off to you	0.2488674504337619
0	What is your takeaway from this whole situation? Lying, telling the truth?	0.25131595840287585
0	I'd love to know your thoughts.	0.2550850099957816
0	But that also wasn't the only story about White House staffers we had in today's news because there was Rob Porter.	0.2564789171542285
0	Rob Porter is an, as of this week, former senior White House staffer. Specifically he was the White House staff secretary	0.2608623883498707
0	which meant that he was essentially the gatekeeper for the papers on their way to the president.	0.26614456284503785
0	And porter became an international story this week because his first and second ex-wives came out with stories that he abused them.	0.2690607633475781
0	The first article we saw was from his second ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby.	0.27445298314472794
0	And interestingly enough before describing the abuse that she received she says,	0.2772224565779579
0	"I want to be very clear when I say this."	0.28111072391467823
0	"I don't want to be married to him. I would not recommend anyone to date him or marry him."	0.28217449516717713
0	"But I definitely want him in the White House in the position he is in."	0.28575096748161327
0	"I think his integrity and ability to do his job is impeccable."	0.28831869119454173
0	"And the majority of the issues he suffers from are very personal and intimate."	0.29081305137281516
0	But then she goes on to describe his extreme anger, how he was verbally and emotionally abusive.	0.2933074115510885
0	Then describing Porter getting more violent. Things aren't working, they get separated.	0.29781926893237715
0	She says he violated the terms of their separation, she files for a protective order against him.	0.30154246831612347
0	There was an instance where he punched through a glass door.	0.3056691671404728
0	In December of 2010, she says Porter assaulted her saying it happened. Just after our first anniversary	0.30836527703904776
0	I cannot remember what the fight was about but I excused myself from the fight in a way that was typical at that time I	0.3121334115877703
0	Certainly was not meek and mild and said I'm not going to fight you anymore and stormed off and went to take a shower he	0.31634264438860665
0	Was not done fighting with me. It was a glass shower door	0.32057938851493867
0	He opened it and dragged me by my shoulders out of the shower to yell immediately upon seeing my reaction to that he released me	0.3226152266016177
0	and apologized	0.32734717458687157
0	But it doesn't take away that he was angry enough that that	0.32839260495570677
0	Happened also Porter's first wife in this article is asked for comment	0.330492636135209
0	She says it was verbally emotionally and physically abusive and that is why I left now following this we see senator Orrin Hatch	0.3337573134273609
0	General Kelly's Sarah Huckabee Sanders all speak up for port all supporting him Kelly saying order is a man of true integrity and honor and	0.33935128294481226
0	I can't say enough good things about him. He's a friend a confidant a trusted professional	0.34586229664545237
0	I am proud to serve alongside Sanders Hank Porter is someone of the highest integrity and exemplary character	0.3492003374722594
0	Orrin Hatch who Porter had worked for as chief of staff	0.35378555838820314
0	Saying it's incredibly discouraging to see such a vile attack on such a decent man shame on any	0.35617904370632575
0	Publication that would print this and shame on the politically motivated morally bankrupt character assassins that would attempt to sully a man's good name	0.3598747317645764
0	I've known him for years both as a close friend and as a personal adviser	0.36520275846890304
0	He is kind and considerate towards all the country needs more honest principled people like Rob Porter	0.3680914476459476
0	Which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails	0.37235570309777527
0	And then the other story comes out remember	0.3754644828787851
0	I said that he had a first wife Hobie Holderness gave that small statement for the first article and then	0.37796801349889037
0	separately shared her story	0.3828466885534545
0	She says he was never physical with me while we were dating and now I see there were red flags left and right she talks	0.3840021642242723
0	about him being verbally abusive, emotionally	0.3886983474863819
0	abusive and saying after their marriage in	0.39085340131687546
0	2003 things escalated.	0.39297177338004147
0	The first incident was during their honeymoon when Porter allegedly kicked her because quotes weren't having sex when he wanted to have sex	0.39376960181941567
0	Adding that was the first time he hurt me and then the doors open	0.3996845368009831
0	I didn't do anything and it continued and then Holderness describes an escalation in the violence	0.40217889697925646
0	Pushing, digging an elbow into her, then it escalated to choking her	0.406534856849403
0	She says it was not hard enough for me to pass out	0.4098270454670506
0	but it was scary humiliating and dehumanizing.	0.41167030427525997
0	Holderness then describes an incident in Italy where Porter punched her in the face saying we were arguing and he punched me in the	0.4135227335253012
0	Face he left visible marks when he punched me and I have pictures of that	0.4188782715551235
0	I didn't go to the police because I was scared I was in Italy alone	0.4215468701282028
0	And I didn't know what to do now following all this Porter resigned from his position at the White House and said in a statement	0.42391284412082975
0	These outrageous allegations are simply false	0.4284797241531097
0	I took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago	0.4304605395887974
0	And the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described	0.432936558883407
0	I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign	0.43560515745648626
0	We also received new quotes from the previously mentioned three who defended him Sanders saying	0.4408323093006621
0	It's not a matter of believe or don't believe I heard for anyone who's experienced anything like that	0.4446288722190635
0	I haven't in whatever degree	0.44782018597656037
0	But at the same time I can only talk about my personal experience and interaction Kelley's saying I was shocked by the new allegations	0.4491132182748565
0	Released today against Rob Porter. There's no place for domestic violence in our society	0.4537718027254553
0	I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff relieve every individual deserves	0.4572840819470682
0	The right to defend the reputation senator hatch saying I am heartbroken by today's allegation in every interaction. I've had with Rob	0.4621810978852961
0	He has been courteous professional and respectful my staff loved him and he was a trusted advisor	0.46727069310199365
0	I do not know the details of Rob's personal life domestic violence in any form is important and unacceptable	0.47070869174476826
0	I am praying for Rob and those involved and in the press briefing yesterday deputy press secretary Raj	0.4750288868917704
0	Shah said we all could have done better over the last few hours or last few days and dealing with this situation now what I	0.47882544981017183
0	Will say is the most	0.4833648185169562
0	Interesting response that we've seen here is probably the one from General Kelly the reason I say that is because according to reports	0.48425435137464923
0	It's very likely that he already knew about these allegations	0.48994002531041947
0	According to the intercept Holderness shared her story and photos with the FBI	0.4925902829998349
0	Yes	0.495743997945821
0	Because the FBI was conducting a background check on port which then leads to the report from	0.49615758487243916
0	Politico the FBI	0.5001558975111421
0	Investigation results of importers inability to receive a security clearance in November is preventing him from becoming general Kelly's top deputy	0.5011738165544816
0	Which then brings us to the New York Times?	0.5072721603726867
0	Who say they have two White House officials two sources who said Porter told White House staff these?	0.5086477266474698
0	Allegations were made up and so if all of that reporting was true	0.5131412431450947
0	It's very interesting to see Kelly's statements kind of chain	0.5153329787429158
0	so it's just very interesting to see the kind of change of tone based off of	0.5181941565944648
0	Information it seems that they already knew becoming public and so then that of course brings up the question	0.5217522880252371
0	Why do they wait to move on this?	0.5254296351998239
0	Well the beliefs around that is it might have something to do with him dating or at least hooking up with hope hiks hiks of	0.5271628487060507
0	Course is the White House communications director who's one of trumps closest aides	0.5320873759697742
0	So as he kept on because of his relationship with ho pics	0.5352236670762798
0	But also it could be the other thing because they are in a relationship	0.537562129743411
0	They may have asked her as he ever as he ever done anything close to what is being described in these stories	0.5401848761073309
0	Maybe she said no and so they believed it and as right now. That's where we are	0.5446692221631239
0	It'll be interesting to see if more information comes out if Porter explains his defense that's that I do want to pass the question off	0.5475212295728408
0	To you what is what is your takeaway from this whole story?	0.5530234946719733
0	What do you think about the initial reaction the reactions after the second story?	0.5553344460136089
0	Well know your thoughts. Also of course if you're willing to share if you're a trump supporter	0.5590759862810191
0	You're a trump hater someone in between I also	0.5623590044568347
0	I also like to know that because then I get to see kind of specific reactions	0.5644682060781688
0	Then we'll talk about one of the more requested stories this week about Doritos	0.5676044971846743
0	If you did not see the CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi was a guest on for economics radio last week and in this interview with	0.5709883902206409
0	The host Stephen Dubner we get this back and forth I understand that men and women eat chips	0.5765722722520771
0	Very differently can you tell us the differences? I you know when you eat out of a flakes bag?	0.5811125580030446
0	You know one of our single serve bags?	0.5849641435724373
0	Especially as you	0.5875593786108615
0	Watch a lot of the young guys eat the chips they love their Doritos	0.5890449901876272
0	And you know they lick their fingers with great Glee and when they reach the bottom of the bag they pour the little	0.5927498486877097
0	Broken pieces into their mouths because they don't want to lose that taste of the flavor and the broken chips and the bottom	0.5996368505034573
0	you know women I think would love to do the same, but they don't they don't like to crunch too loudly in public and	0.6069823744107992
0	You know they don't lick their fingers generously, and they don't like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavor into their mouth	0.6136676265062451
0	So is there like a male and female version of chips that you're playing with or now?	0.6203253672761954
0	It's not a male and female as much as other snacks for women that can be	0.6242869981475707
0	Designed and packaged differently and yes, we are looking at it and	0.6308897162665297

0	the full taste profile	0.6399950479614108
0	You know not have so much of the flavor stick on the fingers	0.6421959540010638
0	And how can you put it in your purse because women love to carry a snack in their purse?	0.6449379161087981
0	And oh did the internet have a field day with this one people saying it's stupid. It's a ridiculous idea	0.6498074207215304

0	he didn't hear the	0.24820317414577606
0	did hear the	0.2507194378800607
0	So this alert went out because	0.2529076610968388
0	missile was	0.255741673881414
0	Which looking back at the	0.25814473147632383
0	because, reportedly, after	0.26089255322296595
0	this is a drill, there's also	0.26484061733366093
0	where you have to say, yes,	0.2681030124410974
0	no, whoops, sorry	0.2711943119060698

0	Then in what are some people	0.2913938891840539
0	let's talk about Kim Kardashian.	0.2941584345649218
0	Kim for whatever	0.2965190398575661
0	probably that she got tired that	0.2982364284492174

0	wasn't actually because of that.	0.3254920929370947

0	anything at all, links is always	0.50027851283153
0	And then let's talk about	0.5038419333550311
0	President Trump and	0.5046999844341559
0	Today you may have seen one	0.5069756851222691
0	saying "Trump refuses to impose	0.5095935770953106
0	"passed by US Congress	0.5135429276394076
0	And this has sparked questions	0.5162470106503821
0	administration's perceived	0.5189510936613567
0	a strong stance on Russia.	0.5214403422941996
0	Let's explain why this is	0.5229004442054537
0	the White House	0.5256045272164283
0	And to do that, let's first	0.5275792024884768
0	Congress almost	0.5304119288396499
0	Countering America's Adversaries	0.5331160118506245
0	We're talking a	0.5360349292397307
0	That's an insane	0.5391686810069686
0	They can go outside say,	0.5408423308629524
0	they'd have like a 10 hour	0.5439323438945227
0	The vote would end up	0.546937452321562
0	So it goes through	0.5492556053119408
0	the President doesn't like it	0.5509729939035921
0	With how much	0.5539343635949638
0	even if Trump had vetoed it,	0.5556942044888807
0	So what did the law do?	0.5584407398021208
0	Iran and North Korea for	0.5610161794728967
0	and, critical to the current	0.5644162229543458
0	also imposed rules for	0.5673698740453056
0	And this was meant to	0.5699453137160816
0	Their annexation of Crimea,	0.5725207533868575
0	separatists in eastern Ukraine.	0.5753097410023632
0	The Russian meddling	0.577155772934213
0	And this bill was supposed to	0.5796025692647905
0	defensive and	0.582220461237832
0	Also the bill removed	0.5839378498294833
0	to change sanctions as freely.	0.5857838817613331
0	This by imposing	0.5878010093356472
0	And this meant the President	0.5902053533639591
0	sanctions which was something	0.5929518886771992
0	Congress feared	0.5944119905884532
0	And despite signing	0.5963853794270998
0	"In its haste to	0.5986186278129474
0	"the Congress included a number	0.6006782076895271
0	"of clearly	0.6021807619030467
0	Later adding, "This bill	0.6047562015738226
0	"particularly because	0.6077175712651944
0	"executive branch's	0.6099070809153746
0	"Congress could not even	0.6122252339057533
0	"after seven years of talking.	0.6146720302363307
0	"By limiting the	0.6162594890543814
0	"this bill makes it harder for	0.618406546402296
0	"deals for the American	0.6213679160936678
0	"Russia and North Korea	0.6240295468023768
0	Now today is not actually the	0.6264326043972867
0	deadline on this law.	0.6291804261439288
0	The first one	0.6305967893195153
0	The Trump administration was	0.6324852735536307
0	Issuing "regulations or other	0.6354466432450026
0	"that are a part of,	0.6396532804694968
0	"the defense and	0.6437312743537923
0	"government of	0.6458345929660394
0	And it took roughly three weeks	0.6476368861622218
0	the administration to	0.6505133512490625
0	So then comes the big deadline,	0.6530887909198385
0	The administration is	0.6579386448453257
0	a few things by this point.	0.6600857021932403
0	They were supposed	0.6615020653688269
0	These are individuals with	0.6640775050396028
0	who've made large sums of money	0.6671675180711732
0	because of their	0.66892735896509
0	Here the administration barely	0.6706871998590069
0	put out the list right	0.672147301770261
0	They listed 114	0.6741644293445751
0	96 billionaires and	0.6766974167130855
0	Also note here, they issue	0.6796587864044572
0	but we don't know	0.6822265074748213
0	Next up were the	0.6844224492920113
0	viewed as the big sanctions.	0.6861398378836627
0	CAATSA required that the US	0.687857226475314
0	and entities that are doing	0.6908185961666857
0	"on the October 1st blacklist."	0.6941671823120553
0	And these sanctions were meant	0.6957983798657735
0	Russian arms and	0.6985024628767481
0	the Russian arms industry.	0.7007344248291938
0	However, the Trump	0.7019784059289143
0	and this is where	0.704941062053688
0	Many are upset by this move.	0.706787093985538
0	Representative Eliot Engel	0.7086755782196533
0	Committee saying, "I'm fed up	0.7113796612306279
0	"to protect our country	0.7142548398840666
0	"They've now shown	0.7165305405721798
0	"so it's time for	0.7182903814660967
0	"The Trump administration had a	0.7201788657002122
0	"would follow the law and crack	0.722668114333055
0	"attacking American	0.7256307704578288
0	"They chose instead to let	0.7282049236952027
0	Claire McCaskill tweeting,	0.7309527454418449
0	"to impose sanctions on Russia.	0.7347734526457432
0	"The President	0.7364895548039926
0	"Folks that is a	0.7385928734162397
0	"There should be outrage in	0.7413831474651473
0	And a note there,	0.7443445171565191
0	to Article 2, Section 3 and	0.7462330013906345
0	which is a thing I totally know	0.750226090670399
0	out thanks to the	0.7536595814202997
0	the President	0.7554194223142165
0	"be faithfully executed".	0.7575651932287292
0	But on that note,	0.7590252951399833
0	Trump administration say they	0.7607413972982325
0	the sanctions	0.7635316713471402
0	They're still being widely	0.7650342255606598
0	know what their rationale is.	0.7677383085716344
0	We had State Department official	0.7688973850668238
0	saying, "Sanctions on specific	0.7720735891363272
0	"need to be imposed	0.7756794619620939
0	"in fact, serving	0.7781687105949369
0	"Since the enactment of	0.7799722902245212
0	"we estimate that foreign	0.7822042521769669
0	"planned or announced purchases	0.7845224051673457
0	"Russian defense acquisitions."	0.7880845392574449
0	And so essentially the	0.7896732845088976
0	sanctions in place because	0.7918615077256758
0	has caused deals	0.7945848872376802
0	However a point of contention	0.7966264570466319
0	evidence to back up the claim.	0.8002747821746642
0	And then another argument from	0.8019921707663155
0	the White House	0.803322342903969
0	CAATSA only says that	0.8057266869322809
0	"significant transaction" with	0.8085851419514938
0	However, they say the	0.8123801204873524
0	"significant transactions" are.	0.8146596804756716
0	The law also allows	0.817101331072641
0	sanctions if they see an entity	0.8193757453273522
0	"their deals with Russia".	0.8239258602701768
0	They just need to notify	0.8251273890676316
0	However, "significantly" is	0.8280463064567379
0	So based on that technicality,	0.8316959180181721
0	still doing	0.8345710966716109
0	You could say, "Well, is	0.8362884852632622
0	And then go like, "Well, it's	0.8394646893327656
0	And then you could go, "That	0.8428119890447332
0	"Bajillion's kind	0.8461605751901027
0	"for significant in my book."	0.848521180482747
0	Also, because I know sometimes	0.8499375436583336
0	these videos because	0.8529207827175391
0	yes, I know bajillion's	0.8554319007182157
0	That's kind of the point, okay.	0.8574503147259318
0	Also another important note here	0.8589091302037839
0	published of potential sanction	0.8617855952906246
0	those on the blacklist.	0.8651766337382597
0	The problem for the	0.8664206148379802
0	major US and NATO	0.8682241944675645
0	Turkey, for example,	0.8709282774785391
0	They also have a major deal with	0.8736323604895136
0	Russia for anti-aircraft	0.8754346536856961
0	Saudi Arabia as well	0.8777952589783403
0	and is a huge US	0.880585533027248
0	India is also a huge partner	0.8828612337153612
0	and a massive buyer	0.8856502213308668
0	And so the argument	0.8878834697167145
0	those countries, all of	0.8899108887582444
0	Trump administration	0.8923139463531543
0	It'd put the United States	0.8946218078763172
0	And while the administration	0.8969824131689614
0	impose sanctions, they're	0.8993005661593402
0	so is a deterrent enough.	0.9026054135690422
0	But that said, all of this	0.9041504200848274
0	CIA Director Mike Pompeo stated	0.9066409551510723
