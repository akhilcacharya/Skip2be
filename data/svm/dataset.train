0	 Two weeks ago I posted a video about why flying is so expensive and it turned out to be popular.	0.00031664357807243223
0	 However, they also wanted to know how it is possible that budget airlines are so cheap.	0.012230358203047695
0	 That is a complicated but interesting answer. To keep it simple, and to ...	0.0243221848406887
0	 not to exclude our European friends, we will focus on the European model of budget airlines.	0.03378191173560261
0	 Although there are low-cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia and many other places ...	0.043795764892143284
0	 budget airlines were the first successful in Europe and they are still today.	0.053888778943202056
0	 The extent to which airlines such as Ryanair and	0.06214130219671482
0	 EasyJet to reduce costs in Europe is also more significant than elsewhere in the world. Budget airlines in	0.07078962992281813
0	 the US can be 10 to 20 percent cheaper than their traditional competitors, while in Europe	0.08096180486839501
0	 the price of a budget airline only costs half or even a third of the price of one	0.09129032258064516
0	 normal airline. You can regularly find flights of 2 to 3 hours with budget airlines for less than	0.10061349693251534
0	 ten euro. So, how do they work? Not completely surprising	0.11080348307935879
0	 Budget airlines take every expensive part of the flight and make it cheap.	0.12040372056204235
0	 The most essential thing an airline needs is its planes and it is possible to save on this.	0.12998218879873344
0	 In the months and years after 9/11 the growth of aviation stagnated	0.13835345339402336
0	 most airlines had to fight to survive. Meanwhile, it went well with Ryanair and placed it	0.14866415990500692
0	 a huge order of 151 737's from Boeing for an incredibly low price.	0.1596279437957649
0	 Fortunately such a situation does not occur often, but budget airlines can always place large orders,	0.1745101919651692
0	 what gives them a bulk discount. It may seem strange that a budget airline	0.18480110825252324
0	 buy brand new planes, but the latest planes are the most efficient, saving fuel.	0.19323174351870176

0	 JetBlue (4.7), Ryanair (5.0) and Spirit Airlines (5.7) all have a younger fleet than any other major	0.21557490599643775
0	 airline (KLM: 9.4, Air France: 11.5, Lufthansa: 12.4). Budget airlines usually have	0.22539085691668315
0	 just one type of plane. Ryanair only has 737s and uses EasyJet alone	0.23073421729665544
0	 the A320 family. One type of aircraft means pilots, flight attendants, mechanics	0.2431426875123689
0	 and ground staff but need to be trained for one type of aircraft, which is a huge saving	0.2555887591529784
0	 time and costs. Inside the aircraft, budget airlines often avoid unnecessary luxuries	0.26507025529388484
0	 to keep costs low. For example, Ryanair seats can not be changed, because that is the	0.2751434791213141
0	 purchase price would increase and more maintenance would take. The design of the chair	0.28606768256481296
0	 saves the flight attendants time, because there are no bags on the seats that need to be cleaned between	0.29511181476350684
0	 flights through. Stewardesses of budget airlines often stand by	0.3049079754601227
0	 at the beginning of their career and get little training. They obviously get the	0.31074609143083315
0	 necessary safety training, but little training in hospitality. In addition, they often fulfill	0.31850385909360773
0	 multiple functions. When they have landed, some stewardesses will	0.32835939046111223
0	 going to the gate to check tickets while others clean the plane. This saves	0.3370670888581041
0	 the airline has three or four functions that it would otherwise have had to pay for. On board are flight attendants	0.34712052246190384
0	 obviously responsible for eating and drinking, which is almost never free. Service on board	0.35570947951711857
0	 can be a perfect way to earn extra money. Many budget airlines sell duty-free products	0.3659212349099545

0	 In many cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of the few airlines that	0.44120324559667523
0	 fly from that airport, which offers them a strong negotiating position. Often they will	0.45351276469424107
0	 choose a small regional airport and rename it to another airport in a big city.	0.4623392044330101
0	 They can ask for lower start and landing commissions and if the airport does not cooperate ...	0.4734613101128043
0	 just threaten to leave the airport until the airport gives way. If there is no cheap,	0.4828814565604591
0	 cost-effective airport in the vicinity of a city, budget airlines can also fly to regular airports	0.49342964575499704
0	 during quieter hours, where landing fees and the chance of delays can be lower.	0.5027310508608748
0	 Now let's look at the smallest details. The airlines of budget airlines	0.5119532950722343
0	 are generally non-stop in use. This Ryanair plane, for example, went in one of Brussels	0.5193944191569365
0	 to Copenhagen, from Copenhagen to Brussels, from Brussels to Prague, from Prague to Brussels, from Brussels	0.5336216109242035
0	 to Nîmes, from Nîmes to Brussels, from Brussels to Treviso and finally from Treviso to Brussels.	0.5449831783099149
0	 Budget airlines plan only between 30 and 45 minutes between the landing of a flight and the take-off	0.5569344943597863
0	 the next flight, which often leads to delays and, moreover, has little time to clean the plane.	0.5668296061745498
0	 However, this means that the aircraft always brings in money and passengers do not pay	0.5773797743914506
0	 for the time the aircraft is stationary. Have you ever wondered why Southwest does not have reserved seats	0.5859885216702949
0	 offers? Because the 'who-as-first-comes' system ensures that you almost always	0.5958242628141698
0	 arrive at the gate well in time and set up in a neat line. This costs boarding	0.6061151791015238
0	 less time and the plane is faster in the air. Another principle of budget airlines	0.6171383336631704
0	 is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs, where most or all of them	0.6282604393429646
0	 planes leave from. British Airways has London, Air France has Paris and KLM	0.6382149218286166
0	 Amsterdam. To get to most places with these airlines, you need a connection to one of these	0.6493172372847813
0	 "hubs". Budget airlines, however, try to have many destinations from many locations.	0.658242628141698
0	 However, this means that many destinations are only visited a few times a week.	0.6691846427864635
0	 The cheapest budget airlines do not even allow connections between flights.	0.6796932515337424
0	 This would increase costs because they would then have to pay ground staff to transfer baggage,	0.6883831387294677
0	 make a more sophisticated ticket system and passengers to book when they are delayed	0.69748664159905
0	 miss their connection. Speaking of tickets, there is often no way for budget airlines	0.7060953888778944
0	 get tickets from a real person. Ryanair charges 45 pounds	0.71464476548585
0	 if you forget to print your boarding pass and EasyJet and a number of other companies	0.7255293884820898
0	 the check-in almost completely with machines. This also reduces staff costs.	0.7331486245794577
0	 At airports, budget airlines do not want to use a trunk because they are expensive.	0.7458717593508807
0	 Instead, they use stairs and let passengers walk across the platform or leave them one	0.7567187809222244
0	 take a bus to get to the plane. Budget airlines earn a lot of money if they do well.	0.7652087868592915
0	 EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%) and Wizz Air (10.2%) all have higher profit margins	0.7745299821887988
0	 than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%) and Air France (2.15%). Much of the	0.7836334850583812
0	 traditional airlines have employees who are members of a trade union with salary agreements	0.7918662180882644
0	 that can not be changed, while budget airlines can hire everyone and train in a few months.	0.8013655254304374
0	 It is also difficult for traditional airlines to grow. There must be a lot of demand for each new route	0.8102315456164655
0	 because a large share of their turnover comes from business travelers.	0.8199485454185632
0	 Because budget airlines are more focused on tourists, every destination that Ryanair adds for example	0.830001979022363
0	 a popular destination, simply because it has become possible to get there	0.8393231743518702
0	 cheap to go. Some traditional airlines in Europe start their own budget airlines	0.8490184049079754
0	 to also make a profit in this way. Air France has established Transavia and Lufthansa started Eurowings.	0.8592717197704334
0	 Both lose a lot of money. What they seem to forget is	0.8691252721155749
0	 that the US has gone through this phase a few decades ago. Delta started Song,	0.8791806847417376
0	 that failed. US Airways started MetroJet, which failed. United started Shuttle, which failed	0.888244607164061
0	 after which they were declared bankrupt and decided to try again with Ted, which also failed.	0.9021373441519889
0	 None of these has worked! Traditional airlines can not negotiate their employment contracts,	0.9104096576291312
0	 honest business and dedication to their hubs. The reason that Ryanair	0.916067682564813
0	 and EasyJet succeeded while others failed, especially because they are	0.9186008311893924
0	 be big and flexible. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands	0.9272313477142292
0	 employees and a negotiating position that enables them to exceed their competitors.	0.9384128240649119
0	 In the end, competition is good for us as customers. Even failing budget airlines	0.9501088462299624
0	 reduce the costs of traditional airlines and enable us to fly the world more cheaply.	0.9606174549772413

0	of amazing display technology on display	0.046234767577522935
0	first up is their 144 hertz 4k HDR	0.061222339715700465
0	gaming monitor that we actually saw	0.07597189001049637
0	demoed like a year ago the PG 2 7uq but	0.0870925826930806
0	the key difference is that they are	0.1074571072932234
0	actually going to be shipping this thing	0.11366518520830814
0	really soon so that's a large 27-inch	0.11963524128001124
0	g-sync display 144 hertz 4k pretty much	0.1313412335774683
0	can't go wrong unless of course you're	0.14725748110457743
0	into ultra wide gaming in which case	0.1545190983264333
0	might be more into the PG 35 VQ so	0.16083643216962762
0	that's a 34 40 by 1440 35 inch g-sync	0.1761712820792964
0	200 Hertz display so that is double the	0.19603244901064856

0	calling it yeah yeah BFG D or big format	0.26350188661575863
0	gaming display I don't think they have a	0.28176323459979163
0	model name for it yet but in a nutshell	0.2892550696701642
0	it's a 65 inch monitor effectively	0.2966298448175621
0	because it doesn't have a TV tuner but	0.31325235387995115
0	it does have a lot of features that are	0.32191478818006936
0	appealing to gamers so it uses a VA	0.32752976248541626
0	panel with a three thousand to 1	0.3347874777098397
0	contrast ratio it runs out a hundred and	0.3406404738585682
0	twenty Hertz 4k resolution with HDR and	0.34965798992504266
0	it has a built-in Nvidia shield so you	0.3628857612211691
0	can play Android games you can stream	0.375177053133499
0	Netflix Amazon Prime	0.3829030080498207
0	etc but most importantly they're	0.38910718396747296
0	boasting ultra-low latency so if you're	0.39905727742031144
0	a couch gamer that looks like it's going	0.40876934902976836
0	to be the solution sometime later this	0.41778686509624274
0	year the most visually interesting one	0.4284354160894962
0	though is probably this guy now on the	0.44143296953710603
0	surface this looks pretty boring it's	0.45220248245076655
0	just like a couple of rubber pieces at	0.46624967320771504
0	the top and bottom and then it's a strip	0.4766641043550193
0	of PMMA which is a plastic material	0.4868522196512395
0	similar to acrylic but what's special	0.49535857405405825
0	about it	0.5080361637122043
0	is the Fresnel style lenses that are cut	0.513151682346193
0	into it so traditionally the way to	0.5279012326409889
0	achieve bending of light would be to	0.5384327237112678
0	have like a big bubble lens but instead	0.5481525993155897
0	this just has a bunch of slits cut into	0.5557614943089367
0	it all along kind of similar to the	0.5660588655332665
0	rings that you see inside of an HTC vive	0.5748383597563593
0	and what it does is if you put it on top	0.5851396329781215
0	of the bezels of Zeus's PG 2 v 8 q	0.5971968050445022
0	gaming monitor it makes them essentially	0.6117122354933491
0	disappear by stretching the edge of this	0.6235352877137806
0	screen and the edge of this one creating	0.6334853811666192
0	a bezel effect now it's not perfect you	0.6450743135411017
0	do lose a little bit of light so they	0.6583020848372282
0	are a little bit dimmer but I will say	0.667081579060321
0	that if you're into sim racing the	0.6756308554348971
0	experience is significantly more	0.6833529083537863
0	immersive they're optimized for a	0.6914339450364642
0	hundred and thirty degree angles and	0.6995071777242771
0	they're working on getting it working	0.7058284135649039
0	with the PG 35 V Q and pricing is	0.7116814097136324
0	expected to be able they don't know but	0.7228021023962167
0	they're saying under $100 which like I	0.7293613600802251
0	would hope so but like that seems pretty	0.7428232512223008
0	reasonable if you're into surround	0.7556998427495035
0	gaming so there you go I took apart	0.7606163595144354

1	with my hands completely off the wheel	0.8530546786900214

1	most extreme with a VR headset on that	0.8719364442658196
1	was actually simulating what it would be	0.8875054140214376
1	like if I was in a completely different	0.8985090467810473

0	latency like super low like a monitor	0.16381248918872168
0	it's got DisplayPort and HDMI input just	0.17202906071613908
0	like a monitor it's got a hundred and	0.1801562590093986
0	twenty Hertz max refresh rate just like	0.18586749697284208
0	a monitor and like a high-end gaming	0.19356512714063312
0	monitor it supports variable refresh	0.20377097387995158
0	rate with Nvidia g-sync technology so	0.21086317246151184
0	they're announcing three different	0.22011762670818197
0	models but all of them are using a VA	0.22435564781179726
0	panel from a you Optronics with quantum	0.22963155163466528
0	dot film four DCI p3 color support and	0.23732918180245632
0	nice deep black levels they're also	0.2460358646139653
0	using a full array back light solution	0.2534163639508735
0	with local dimming in order to achieve	0.26197601337715504
0	1000 nits peak brightness with the	0.2685521536066425
0	ability to support HDR now they haven't	0.2751254108285764
0	announced plans for Dolby vision at this	0.282304099636741
0	time but it should be noted that most	0.28679870841261607
0	games maybe there's an exception or two	0.29294239750908146
0	you guys can leave a comment if you can	0.2993397912702531
0	think of anything but most games are	0.30288877356858673
0	supporting HDR through HDR 10 anyway	0.30859712852447674
0	let's talk results now they haven't	0.3158623075592458
0	announced how many local dimming zones	0.32295450614080606
0	these TVs have but if I had to guess I'd	0.32918180245632245
0	say it's probably similar to the 4k high	0.33670645217090467
0	refresh rate monitors that they talked	0.34388514097906936
0	about at CES last year so more than tens	0.3502854177477945
0	but probably not you know over a	0.36316957850429565
0	thousand something along those lines and	0.3713832670241596
0	in terms of results well local dimming	0.37735397566741624
0	is still not oled so that's a thing you	0.384881508389552
0	can see blooms around bright objects in	0.3984604739664418
0	very dark scenes from time to time and	0.4071094966268812
0	it was especially noticeable in menus or	0.4134232831690019
0	if you have a bright moving light moving	0.4193046185781007
0	around your character like let's say	0.4282996021449576
0	like a navvy type assistant but if	0.43314305483480364
0	that's the case you've probably got more	0.4407541947759903
0	annoying things in your life and in	0.44551115723923196
0	general and fast paced situations we	0.4494032174364297
0	didn't really notice it while gaming now	0.4555440235253416
0	let's take a look at the back of a sirs	0.4624632416536931
0	prototype here these are absolutely	0.4686040477426051
0	prototypes so I guess the other thing to	0.4798189471256415
0	consider is that you've got to give them	0.4873724269157585
0	some time to improve it so they're	0.4906590555267255
0	announcing three partners Acer Asus and	0.49541601798996715
0	HP who are gonna launch displays	0.502854177477945
0	hopefully sometime in the summer and	0.5083030617540218
0	it's up to those guys how they want to	0.5132330046704723
0	finish the screen matte or glossy how	0.5179034769071095
0	they want to do the stand the sound the	0.5237848123162082
0	bezel and the OSD options but in terms	0.5294066770454938
0	of the actual performance of the panel	0.5384016606123508
0	they're all using the same panel so it	0.543072132848988
0	should be pretty similar okay then so I	0.5491264487112957
0	mean it's a TV realistically the	0.5594187856772185
0	expectation would be that you can use it	0.5650377673989506
0	for more than just gaming so Nvidia	0.5698841030963501
0	solution to that is to integrate a	0.5758490457244998
0	shield TV so they're full standalone	0.5825087931730382
0	device experience into the display and	0.5925445424667013
0	this is another thing that was in our	0.6011935651271406
0	video why don't you just have a high end	0.6058640373637779
0	thing built into the thing why are they	0.6125209018047627
0	why are they laggy it's ridiculous so	0.6167618059159315
0	Amazon and Netflix both have 4k HDR	0.6217782390589863
0	support and now you've got full	0.6316381248918872
0	integration with Google smart home and	0.6367410482615464
0	Google Voice which is pretty big and	0.6414980107247881
0	this is another announcement today that	0.6470333852274693
0	just like someone mentioned in passing I	0.6527417401833593
0	was like what really g-sync is now	0.6581012512252782
0	supported with game stream and in	0.6651963328143919
0	android games on shield TV though it	0.6723750216225567
0	should be noted you can't just plug your	0.6833592804013147
0	existing shield TV into your TV or your	0.6876837917315344
0	monitor because it only has HDMI out and	0.6935651271406331
0	gsync on the desktop anyway at this time	0.7008879663264718
0	is only supported over DisplayPort	0.7081819754367756
0	another cool thing for the TV guys not	0.7147264025831748
0	the gaming guys out there is video	0.722106901920083
0	playback thanks to variable refresh rate	0.7257394914374675
0	is done at the native frame rate so if	0.7312748659401488
0	you're watching cinematic content it'll	0.7391454765611486
0	be running at 24 fps or if you're	0.7439889292509947
0	running something like the Grand Tour on	0.7496972842068846
0	Amazon then you will actually see it at	0.7541918929827596
0	the 25 fps that it was shot at No	0.7609410136654559
0	stupid interpolation no pulldown no	0.7696765265524995
0	nothing like that	0.7761632935478291
0	so let us know what you guys think in	0.7787580003459609

0	actual gaming TVs is it time well it's	0.8101539526033559
0	gonna depend on your budget like I said	0.8219166234215534
0	it's coming this summer and Nvidia is	0.8268465663380038
0	not commenting on pricing at all so I'm	0.8320359799342675
0	just gonna have to wildly speculate	0.8411174537277287
0	based on what I know about a typical	0.8457014357377617
0	g-sync up charge over a decent monitor	0.8497664763881682
0	and say I wouldn't expect these to be	0.8564262238367064
0	less than probably around 5 grand so let	0.8601453035806954
0	me know what you guys think you're gonna	0.8683618751081128
0	see and what you would pay at the	0.8725134059851237

0	you can just take my word for it it's	0.20532372105919866

0	well let's just say they recognized our	0.07326706602593641
0	crew when we were walking by on the show	0.0832367849384504

0	improvements since then rolling out OTA	0.18237772365216245
0	updates about every two weeks now	0.1903758804555329
0	there's actually been one small hardware	0.19866697386610493
0	tweak as well the screen has been	0.20459482588374694

0	we'll take it now let's talk about the	0.2459647159502337
0	software updates because there have been	0.2538674214995721
0	a ton tweaks to camera processing for	0.2577150944638273
0	better pictures what they're calling	0.26788888157461654
0	fresh and lively features to make Gebo a	0.2738101507471529

0	during the holidays geebo can now play	0.2871437035086564
0	music through iHeartRadio so at this	0.29445066157593314
0	time there's not a ton you can do in	0.3018563623197946
0	terms of voice controls and he still	0.3067934961490356
0	doesn't support services like Spotify	0.31301428477387927
0	but they are expecting to add more	0.3171614771904417
0	services and the ability to do things	0.32436640115858073
0	like TiVo play the next song in the near	0.33039299585280757
0	future the team has added a new	0.3403627147653216
0	commander mode that actually allows you	0.34599104733065633
0	to see through G Bo's eyes which lights	0.3527055493384241
0	up a purple LED revealing that G bow has	0.3616944243301955
0	full RGB lighting in his LED strip and	0.37196037127246395
0	in fact there is probably other hardware	0.3823283523138701
0	lying dormant under the hood and the	0.39220261997235206
0	GEVO team has in fact confirmed that for	0.39901586465670463
0	us another feature of commander mode is	0.4062273714699493
0	the ability to type a message and have G	0.4128431308011323
0	Bo say it - Texas is the best so you can	0.4220261997235205

0	hey there's my son yo kid clean your	0.4404910802448818
0	room and giba will say it well in a in a	0.4476992956355737
0	nicer way geebo now uses information	0.45549996708577445
0	from Google in addition to the previous	0.4623132117701271
0	sources and can also do live sports	0.47080508195642157
0	tours even adding a little bit of color	0.4781120400236982
0	commentary to the mix like the Celtics	0.48571522612072937
0	are crushing the Knicks integration with	0.49598446448555067
0	Philips hue nest and Allrecipes is	0.5036863932591666
0	coming as is a find my phone function	0.5143506023303271
0	something that I'm sure that we can all	0.5246198406951484
0	relate to a big priority for the	0.529260746494635
0	development team is personalized report	0.5360739911789876
0	so debo will see you and say something	0.5425910078335857
0	like hey Linus you got to get going oh	0.5516753340793891
0	by the way it's raining so you might	0.561055888354947
0	want to grab an umbrella on your way out	0.5671779343032058
0	the door or if I were to give debo an	0.5717200974261075
0	instruction like when you see my wife	0.5800144822592325
0	can you ask her to pick up some	0.5866302415904153
0	groceries next time she's at the grocery	0.5935422289513528
0	store debo can pass along that	0.6010466723717991
0	instruction using his facial recognition	0.6077611743795669
0	now to be clear I still have a lot of	0.6146731617405042
0	doubts about Jibo and for that matter	0.6292870778750576
0	smart assistants in general for as long	0.6377789480613522
0	as they are stationary but it's clear	0.647751958396419
0	that the geebo team is a taking feedback	0.657626226054901
0	seriously and be continuing their	0.6639457573563294
0	software development work so I do look	0.6725363702192088
0	forward to seeing how it continues to	0.6801395563162399

1	French roads with real drivers around at	0.7630834046474887
1	a level for autonomous operating level	0.7714765321571984

1	thing going okay I'm leaned way back	0.7913238101507472

1	change lanes and even being able to	0.8315120795207689
1	operate autonomously with the driver	0.8396089790007241
1	wearing a VR headset I was a driver I	0.8484958198933579
1	was wearing a VR headset and they had	0.8581660193535646
1	the sensors of the car actually dialed	0.8644921335000988
1	into the VR headset	0.8723915476268843
1	and the programming for it so that you	0.8769995392008426
1	could be driving in this like	0.8845039826212889
1	fantastical environment like I had like	0.8900335725100388

0	Corsair suite where they are going more	0.03361463725976881
0	tempered glass and more RGB than ever	0.043184880504928726
0	before what a freaking surprise so	0.052123962839514926
0	behind me I've actually got a case that	0.06095312389192256
0	includes no RGB lighting whatsoever	0.07829231969363874
0	this is the Obsidian 500 d and i'm just	0.08690872987731367
0	gonna put it in front of that one for	0.09754627331394937
0	reasons that I will reveal quite shortly	0.10424792567902985
0	this is Corsairs first case with	0.1110559534784767
0	integrated native USB type-c in the	0.11999148996525069
0	front including that 20 pin connector on	0.1300971562300546
0	the inside that is supported on newer	0.13903269271682858
0	motherboards it's got a tempered glass	0.1466917239912063
0	side panel it's got support for two hard	0.15275157790227645
0	drives and three SSDs on the back of the	0.16169066023686263
0	motherboard tray and water cooling	0.16817956173321041
0	support is actually pretty wide open as	0.17456208779519183
0	well it can take up to a triple 120	0.18392312601943125
0	millimeter in the front and a dual 140	0.19562442379973052
0	millimeter in the top and part of that	0.20711297071129708
0	is thanks to its extremely efficient	0.21402382809729806
0	that's fine	0.22739167434933694
0	extremely efficient use of its internal	0.2325366995248564
0	space so it's got a lot of room up here	0.2392383518899369
0	for a big radiator and fins and then	0.24498262534572016
0	it's almost no clearance between the	0.2556201687823559
0	motherboard and the power supply	0.2624281965818027
0	basement down here now this guy's going	0.26785334373448694
0	to be 149 or something along those lines	0.2782745904545777
0	and should be available pretty soon but	0.28625274803205447
0	honestly this isn't the one that I'm not	0.2965747110134033
0	excited about oh yeah there's a	0.30210623360045386
0	removable fan filter I'm not sure how it	0.30668037727820724
0	comes out but no removable fan filter so	0.3234841500602794
0	I'm just gonna put that aside be right	0.3356144954258563
0	back this is the sexy one so this would	0.34242252322530314
0	cost quite a bit more if it were to make	0.371569392241685
0	it to market	0.38114318133465713
0	it's got curved tempered glass on the	0.3839089426281824
0	front just like the concept slate that	0.39444011063045176
0	we showed off last year slash did a	0.40507765406708746
0	video of quite recently it's showing off	0.41252393447273245
0	the vertical GPU mounting that is also	0.4212431742429615
0	available in its little brother and it	0.4308205091837458
0	is also planned to include Corsairs	0.44028792284235163
0	light loop RGB fans so the plan if it	0.45049641869370965
0	were to become a real product would also	0.46347422168640523
0	be to	0.46932841642436707
0	include a Corsair commander Pro so you	0.471101340330473
0	can RG be affected up and estimated may	0.47876037160485074
0	be hypothetical pricing somewhere in the	0.4905680448195163
0	250 dollar range and for how good this	0.4975533650095738
0	thing looks it could be the case to beat	0.5093964967023615
0	if you're into mid towers with tempered	0.5201404155733635
0	glass an RGB but let's say you're not	0.5287568257570385
0	into RGB and you want to spend a lot of	0.5358839798595845
0	money course there has a new power	0.5412027515779023
0	supply for you it has been four years	0.5472661513367846
0	since the ax 1500 I and it finally has a	0.5563080632579249
0	big brother although it should be noted	0.5713069995035813
0	it's actually two centimeters shorter	0.577157648393731
0	this is the ax 1600 I uses gallium	0.5840720516275442
0	nitride MOSFETs in order to achieve its	0.6004538685199631
0	astonishing 94% efficiency at 100% load	0.6100985745691795
0	that is four percent higher than the 80	0.6313027444862066
0	plus titanium spec so the reason Corsair	0.637685270548188
0	hasn't done a successor to the 1500 I is	0.6489610665910219
0	that anything higher than that would	0.6573647259059641
0	trip a 120 volt North American breaker	0.66449188000851
0	anyway well they got this thing so	0.6747039217076803
0	efficient that is only pulling seventeen	0.6815119495071271
0	hundred and thirty watts from the wall	0.6900219842564357
0	at a hundred percent load meaning that	0.696085384015318
0	it won't trip your breaker whew	0.7041699170271611
0	it also comes with coursera link support	0.7115098219984398
0	and my favorite this was actually	0.7193816041415503
0	something that I suggested to course at	0.7297000212750868
0	one point why do you guys just have	0.736295298205801
0	these stickers that you can't remove I	0.7451244592582086

0	put it on whatever way you want it comes	0.7755478334869867
0	with blue and red and white and then the	0.7815048578115027
0	stock is just the the traditional	0.7886320119140486
0	corsair matches everything gray this	0.7970356712289909

0	to understand keikar let's break it down	0.13872617770810988
0	into parts for audio you've got 4 10	0.14788383796716442
0	watt speakers and a 50 watt subwoofer	0.16100156752743172

1	think that functionality is in that	0.7055894728157742
1	right now it might be in there later but	0.7104199323488161
1	with freshbooks you can do tons of stuff	0.7185875752825674
1	you can create invoices in 30 seconds or	0.7272461018067816
1	less which is awesome you can view if	0.7352941176470589
1	someone who's actually seen your invoice	0.7481643428760003
1	or not so they're not paying the invoice	0.7537331903308307
1	you can ask them why and make sure that	0.7619008332645821
1	they've actually seen the invoice maybe	0.7708109891923108
1	if they didn't see it you can resend it	0.7760085801501526
1	or something like that	0.7819486841019718
1	and you can even set up online payments	0.7861521326623216
1	so if they aren't able to pay you in	0.7944476528339246
1	person or if this is an online job or if	0.8011261447075324

0	Trump and then he would not answer any follow-up questions now the reason this is big news is it appears that everyone has just been	0.1619042701502556

0	But why what why what?	0.17875768059069552
0	Other reason would Donald Trump's legal counsel pay a pornstar one hundred thirty thousand dollars out of his own money	0.18025507306242577
0	And so what appears going East right now to do is is no longer to deny that money was paid that was essentially hush money	0.1865028140651624
0	He's now moved to the argument of the money that was paid was definitely not	0.1920173490989828

0	By the FEC and the Department of Justice as we requested last month	0.21805132441782413
0	And I have to say personally I agree with that statement Cohen can talk about not being reimbursed	0.22163473950534415
0	But he stayed employed did Donald Trump. He continued to be paid so the money could be seen as still connect	0.22479475396292664
0	It's not like how Donald Trump always says Mexico is gonna pay for the wall the the argument that he has moved to isn't that	0.23021634739505345

0	 Only 32 of these cities are in the southern hemisphere.	0.6199700925136828

0	included that brings us to their update	0.541684759009987
0	of their Borah line of fans we're gonna	0.5499348675640469
0	start with the Borah plus 120 a three	0.5591619626574034
0	kit of these with their addressable RGB	0.569040382110291

0	drive temperatures and a ton of other	0.606600086843248
0	stuff is $99 for the three fan kit and	0.6147380228687219
0	the controller now if you step down from	0.6261398176291794
0	there get the same three awesome fans	0.6340642640034737
0	but it's you it's managed by an external	0.6418765378491822
0	physical controller that's $69.99 for	0.6513243595310465
0	the three fans and the controller and	0.6623968736430742
0	then if you step down from there again	0.6681502388189319
0	we're not going to low end fans we're	0.6753111883051093
0	just going to a step down from the Borah	0.6818280503690838
0	plus you get what I'm going to call and	0.6897524967433782
0	they've been kind of saying around here	0.698758865248227
0	the Borah light but that is not the	0.704186568244319
0	official name for it and that's this guy	0.7098313793602548
0	I actually personally to possibly their	0.7174301635547836
0	dismay think that it might look better	0.7276378636561007
0	because the RGB is on the inside the	0.7336047184831379
0	LEDs I should say on the inside are	0.7432696482848459
0	actually hidden by the middle sticker	0.7523881893182806
0	and it looks like the fan is just	0.7573816760746852
0	glowing from nothing which i think is	0.763565639021566
0	really cool that is managed by your	0.7699739470256187
0	motherboard through just a simple PWM	0.7778983933999132
0	connector and is $39 for three of them	0.7856021131856998
0	the O 11 dynamic and the new Borah fans	0.7968953538862353
0	are both cheaper than I expected much	0.8080728035895209

0	 in the menu, such as Kiwi Burger in New Zealand or Chicken Kanji in Indonesia, the main menu	0.19951236237570955

0	 the same things are done in the same way with the same products in very different ways	0.23966627300087623
0	 economies around the world. Obviously, BigMaks do not have the same price everywhere. One BM	0.25734313688140503
0	 it costs an average of $ 4.79 in the US, but if they take the equivalent in Kenya, 480	0.28081069755038285
0	 shilling, no one will buy it because it's double the salary. Whatever	0.3027543906434531
0	 to pay $ 200 for BM in the US. That's why McDonald's puts the price on it	0.3203169644557888
0	 of burgers based on many factors such as labor, rent, product costs	0.3406986932835537
0	 and local wages. Now a little true economy. Purchasing power is the number	0.3598232313611947
0	 products that can be bought with a unit of currency. Let me explain. In the US the average price	0.3782239323402796
0	 BM on all markets is $ 4.79. In Sweden, the BM price is 44 kronor.	0.39978284887043314
0	 The 44 kroner is the equivalent of $ 5.13. This means that in the US you can get $ 1	0.42443140691073944
0	 20.8% of BM, while in Sweden you can get only 19.5% of BM. According to BM	0.4552554383024115
0	 the purchasing power of USD is higher. You can get more for the money	0.47662768105451636
0	 yours. This also means that the Swedish krona is overestimated by about 6.1%	0.49742847346565583
0	 at least according to the BigMac Index. The Economist magazine has done	0.5141148234218447
0	 this index in 1986 as a fun way to compare buyer power between currencies. Let me now	0.5367061602346757
0	 to see the numbers. In Venezuela, the cost of BigMac is $ 0.66 - that's it	0.5621928454417311
0	 the cheapest BigMac in equivalent dollars in the world. That's because of	0.5849365690121529
0	 rapid currency falls and high inflation in the country. It's waiting	0.6030324964760563
0	 the price of the Venezuelan BM to jump in response. This means that with	0.6210141338717665
0	 the money for one US BM can buy 7 Venezuelan. After Venezuela	0.6386909977522953
0	 countries with the cheapest BigMac are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa and Malaysia.	0.6625014286258524
0	 On the other hand, the most expensive BigMakers come from Switzerland	0.682193607375519
0	 Sweden, Norway, USA and Denmark. That's true, the US is home to the fourth most expensive	0.7010514686273763
0	 BM in the world. It is also interesting to see for how long one	0.7274905710693741
0	 one will get enough money for a BM in different cities around the world. In Nauru, Kenya	0.746005562116652
0	 the average worker must work 173 minutes to pay for a BM.	0.7688635757552669
0	 Compare with Hong Kong, where you need to robotic only 8.7 min for	0.7900110480399253
0	 burger. You can get a Burger in Miami where you have to	0.809207969827422
0	 you only work 10.7 min for BigMac. Tossy index is not	0.8265838698617091
0	 perfect. While the cost of products is almost the same everywhere, because	0.8472322755152577
0	 all products are one standard, the index does not see big differences	0.8617090174863804
0	 in price of land and labor. A burger will cost less in India because McDonald's	0.8791953979199207
0	 you do not have to pay much for place and workers. However, this index	0.8982018362604289

0	be good to go again just through this	0.29559322033898305
0	nice little simple port on the back the	0.3019661016949153

0	lighting modes it is powered by cam	0.320271186440678
0	software like I previously mentioned so	0.32840225988700567
0	you have all your standard RGB lighting	0.336
0	modes as you can see here we're just	0.34440677966101696
0	cycling through a bunch of colors so	0.35240677966101697
0	it's also breathing and everything else	0.3579661016949153
0	you would expect from an RGB product but	0.3652881355932203
0	then they also have a really cool	0.3769491525423729
0	counterstrike mode which we aren't	0.383864406779661
0	currently displaying but you'll be	0.3926779661016949
0	seeing through b-roll it shows stuff	0.3982372881355932
0	like when you die it's red if you're at	0.4050169491525424
0	full health it's green and it gradients	0.41559322033898305
0	all the way through to paying on what	0.4242666666666667

0	flash banged it'll go white if you stand	0.43728813559322033
0	in smoke it'll go gray if the bomb is	0.44854237288135596
0	currently ticking it will go yellow and	0.45776271186440676
0	tick with the bomb and then when it's 10	0.46888135593220337
0	seconds left in the bomb it'll go red	0.47945310734463276
0	and tick with the bomb still which is	0.4862327683615819
0	actually a really cool feature so at	0.49233898305084745
0	this point in time I don't know what it	0.5002033898305085
0	will cost I don't know if it will show	0.5075254237288136
0	up as an upgrade kit or if it will be	0.5152542372881356
0	natively in the chairs or possibly both	0.5227073446327684
0	we'll have to find out at a later date	0.5342372881355932
0	another thing that they launched here	0.544
0	was coffee fibre material for headrests	0.5511864406779661
0	and lumbar support cushions as long with	0.5620338983050848
0	an entire chair if you decide to get the	0.5716564971751412
0	one that I'm sitting in right now what	0.5801988700564972
0	the heck is coffee fiber material well	0.5873853107344633
0	it's actually a synthetic material	0.5966101694915255
0	with coffee fiber layered on top of it	0.6048813559322034
0	and what this does is it absorbs odors	0.6145084745762712
0	it dries faster so if you get a little	0.6242711864406779
0	sweaty when you're sitting in your chair	0.6351186440677966
0	it will absorb that and dry that much	0.6408135593220339
0	more quickly which is cool it's common	0.6503050847457628
0	in sportswear and clothes because of	0.6596610169491526

0	 Flying is expensive. Why is this? Most will say by the cost of fuel	0.00014111528643232017
0	 but that's not quite right. The Airbus A320Neo can carry 24,000 liters of fuel. That is	0.009006009291410995
0	 as much as 376 Toyota Camry's that have been refueled. For every mile and a half that the A320 flies,	0.01923290364521397
0	 it consumes 6 liters of kerosene. That amounts to a void kilometer per 4 liters. An A320	0.030331858757868365
0	 can hardly fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Termal on those four liters	0.041700359923258656
0	 fuel. To fly the 340 kilometers from New York to DC, the A320 needs 1200 liters of fuel.	0.04851828949246064
0	 With that amount, our Toyota Camry can drive 49 times from New York to LA. But we also have to think	0.06134551047265693
0	 that our Camry has only 5 seats. An A320 has 154. So, assuming the plane	0.07165168307726458
0	 fully loaded, it has a fuel efficiency of 170 kilometers per four liters per person.	0.08470088315971397
0	 That is amazing! According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, airlines pay an average of only $ 1.24.	0.09751224848974932
0	 per four liters of fuel. So, you even use only $ 2.50 of fuel, flying from New York to DC,	0.10778512422901901
0	 so why do these tickets cost more than $ 80 ?! Well, there is a lot more	0.11896335759247809
0	 the ticket price then only determines fuel. Before we start I just want to say this	0.1280327894845328
0	 are already gross estimates. Many of these prices will vary greatly over time and there will be	0.13478729645309107
0	 certainly way in which airlines reduce these costs, but this gives you a general idea	0.14130396866923528
0	 what really makes flying so expensive. The first thing we can add to the airline ticket	0.14682173492524062
0	 are the costs of the crew. A pilot earns an average of $ 79,000 per year, which amounts to about $ 44 per flight hour.	0.15440232126718356
0	 We have two pilots for a one-hour flight from New York to DC	0.16638760722383422
0	 that's $ 88 for the pilots. A fully loaded A320 needs four flight attendants,	0.17441056620526724
0	 each à about $ 38 per hour, for a total of $ 152, representing the total cost of the crew	0.18319459639442515
0	 $ 240 brings. So, with our 154 seats that comes down to about $ 1.50 per person in costs for the crew.	0.19375604496662385
0	 Okay, now we're at $ 4. Then we have to pay for the airports.	0.20658009481678796
0	 The JF Kennedy Airport in New York is asking for $ 6.33 per 500 kg plane that is taking off, and our A320	0.21649304729740443
0	 weighs 86,000 kilos. That means we pay $ 1089 in JFK, or over $ 7 per person	0.2279883936640822
0	 Dulles Airport does not show what its landing costs are, but we assume that it's about	0.24129128414910653
0	 the same as the landing costs at JFK for our 86,000 kilos aircraft. These costs	0.24688674309090045
0	 generally contain the costs of using gates, doormen and other facilities, and	0.25793971681808814
0	 come down to $ 13.50 per person. Our total is now $ 17.50. Now comes the nice part - taxes.	0.26535857552838954
0	 There is a long list of different taxes and they all vary per country,	0.2791228654330971
0	 so for convenience we only deal with those for the US. The easiest load is the	0.285923353787122
0	 tax for domestic passenger transport at 7.5% of the ticket price. That money goes to the FAA.	0.2934072206630833
0	 If you land or take off at an airport in the countryside, defined as "an airport with less than 100,000	0.3036658263172081
0	 landings / starts during the second consecutive calendar year and is either 1) not located within 120 km	0.3111179818928475
0	 from another airport with 100,000+ takeoffs / landings per year, 2) receives essential aviation subsidies	0.3167943046504622
0	 or 3) is not connected to another airport connected by "a highway", then they also add	0.32324913983097875
0	 7.5% more. That is obviously not applicable for both airports. The FAA also brings	0.3293361239277617
0	 $ 4 for every flight within the US unless you fly to Hawaii or Alaska. Then they bring	0.3391840682427183
0	 $ 8.70 in charge. The TSA then adds $ 5.60 in taxes, called the "9/11 security tax" that is used	0.348236058919596
0	 to pay for the increased security since 9/11. This is only for domestic flights.	0.36031806434222835
0	 If we were to fly from New York to Paris we would also pay $ 17.70 as	0.36783364251851147
0	 tax for international transport, $ 5.50 for customs costs, $ 5.00 for the	0.37560291109736954
0	 "Animal and plant health inspection", $ 7.00 for Immigration and Naturalization supplement	0.3859090837019772
0	 and $ 14 for the French Civil Aviation Tax. So, with all taxes and surcharges that apply	0.39390191694810445
0	 for this short flight we are now at $ 33 in total. Let's not forget that planes	0.4035722779812586
0	 expensive. Our A320 costs $ 170 million. The lifespan of aircraft is not really determined	0.41264329543832945
0	 by the number of flight hours, it is determined by something we call "flight cycles",	0.42312388019470737
0	 what the neat word is for one flight. It does not really matter how long it flies	0.43002108801471406
0	 in its lifetime, which is how often it has been under pressure. This is	0.4373939653395488
0	 because every time an aircraft has been under pressure micro cracks develop around the rivets	0.44536777180548287
0	 connect the metal plates to form the hull. Regardless of whether the aircraft flies for 30 minutes	0.45232998779114936
0	 or 9 o'clock, the wear and tear of the aircraft remains the same. This is why long-distance aircraft	0.46011511202016836
0	 usually older. They only go through one flight cycle per day	0.4679319475495093
0	 while small regional jets do 8 to 10. So, back to our A380. Our plane	0.475033693256592
0	 is actually a relatively sustainable aircraft. It can fly up to 60,000 cycles. If we are the	0.48458038021849087
0	 dividing the total price of the aircraft by the maximum number of flight cycles, we arrive at $ 1783	0.4934738143937592
0	 per flight required to pay the aircraft.	0.5042096751177282
0	 Per person that comes down to $ 11.50. We are now at $ 44.50. To keep the plane safe,	0.5114398515911145
0	 airlines also have to do regular maintenance. For a one-hour flight, a society must	0.5245350330590306
0	 carry out maintenance at the cost of about $ 646 in working hours, $ 276 in parts, $ 603 in inspections and	0.5322107533019391
0	 and another $ 596 on repairs to the engine. That is $ 2121 in total or $ 14 per passenger. We sit	0.5457023260238786
0	 now at $ 58.50. We must also think of the part that is not flown.	0.5613994196832041
0	 Every airline has a company that is a company and incurs costs in itself. They pay	0.5721194247570122
0	 administrative staff, directors, software engineers, marketing staff, consultants,	0.5792845930647387
0	 customer service staff, PR staff, cleaners, but also rent, benefits, travel costs,	0.5868334681063597
0	 running costs and much more. It is difficult to put an exact amount on it and how much that costs	0.595268673991977
0	 per person, but we make a conservative estimate of $ 10. We are now at $ 68.50.	0.6020231809605353
0	 OK, insurance. A company pays approximately $ 106,500 a year to insurance for an A320 and assuming that	0.6129778496567252
0	 our plane is in the air 8 hours a day, this hour costs $ 36,	0.6237612773311769
0	 or about 25 cents per person. So, our total amounts to $ 68.75.	0.6316256798110006
0	 We round this off to $ 70 because we are a few small things that I have not treated	0.641977833801075
0	 such as hotel costs for the crew, aircraft storage, assistance, entitlement insurance, etc.	0.6498422362808987
0	 That means that 10 $ of the plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that my estimates	0.6594840571437631
0	 on the conservative side and that I assume that the device is completely full. Eventually it goes	0.6672216144222994
0	 not a lot of money to society. Back to my first sentence "Flying is expensive".	0.6753872742551809
0	 Well, actually it is not that expensive and it is also cheaper. To be able to fly in the magical iron bird over land	0.6835354928728853
0	 from New York to LA in 6 hours costs about $ 340 return. In our very economical	0.6918121422568932
0	 Toyota Camry to drive over land in 40 hours costs $ 340 alone	0.7020881891261951
0	 to fuel and then an estimated $ 300 in maintenance and depreciation costs. In the	0.7113780145554869
0	 last 30 years the ticket price for flying has dropped by 50% if you include the inflation, and the	0.7199083543420698
0	 is still falling. In 1974 it was illegal to offer a flight between New York	0.7292964848023593
0	 and LA ,. for less than $ 1442, including inflation, and now you can take these flights	0.7376682680873329
0	 sometimes l find for less than $ 200 return. One of the reasons for this reduction	0.7480045664272463
0	 in prices is the emergence of highly efficient aircraft. Some innovations such as plastic structures,	0.7552204728154878
0	 better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and, perhaps most importantly, winglets, have the costs	0.7646054321457452
0	 for flying significantly reduced. Here is the only real reason of "Real Engineering"	0.7736114414371561
0	 explain the winglets.	0.7818738207360193
0	 As you said, the aviation industry is constantly looking for ways to reduce the cost of their fuel consumption.	0.7823796159761531
0	 In the early 1970s fuel prices rose explosively, and engineers were obliged to find new ways	0.7896906562653602
0	 to make their aircraft more efficient. One of them was the winglets, those are those small ones	0.7978246047979197
0	 curved pieces at the end of the wing. Let's see how they work quickly. Winglets were	0.8037371767429323
0	 introduced to lower induced air resistance, which occurs when high pressure is under the wing	0.8102237232237708
0	 overflows to the low pressure above it. This flow creates swirls	0.8173746214463524
0	 the tips of the wings that create resistance and reduce the upward pressure, which in turn is the fuel efficiency	0.8256671264805213
0	 of the plane. Winglets are there to reduce these eddies through the airflow over the	0.8325484786503671
0	 edge of the wing. For a full explanation you have to look at the history of the winglets, go	0.8394615421205347

0	 the real reason why certain tickets are so expensive, but also a reason why they become cheaper - competition	0.8709825746404731
0	 or the lack of it. The aviation industry is one with very little competition. Ticket prices	0.878307885014825
0	 from New York to LA are cheap because there is a lot of demand and there is relative	0.8867589465506033
0	 lots of competition. Five different airlines fly directly from New York to LA, two	0.8936085874201272
0	 of these are budget companies. People often do not care what society they fly with, they do	0.9022499167578366
0	 find the price more important, so companies will try to match the prices of the budget airlines.	0.9099874740363728
0	 Compare this with a route like Denver - Gunnison Country. Especially because only United	0.9176140417637825
0	 offering this flight will often cost you more than $ 500 for a flight of 210 km.	0.9253833103426407
0	 So, that's why tickets are so expensive. Next time you book a wicker, you will	0.9338660831787408

0	 about. Colleges need places to teach and the school infrastructure is unusually expensive.	0.3185018243742168
0	 Lessons usually take place only for 8 to 10 hours a day, 5 days a week and about 40	0.33201927077946597
0	 weeks per year. That means that classrooms are only used 23% of the time. The university must	0.3427466392790054
0	 however, just pay for that space during that other 77% of the time, which costs a lot.	0.3576110198456317
0	 Moreover, colleges like to build beautiful buildings because they attract students. The average	0.37067147073184226
0	 cost to build a building varies by location, but is $ 115 to $ 215 per average	0.3803645862146099
0	 square meter. However, U-Mass Amherst's Commonwealth Honors College cost $ 354 per year	0.3944592901175922

0	 and the Berkely's Lower Sproul Building cost $ 659 per square meter.	0.42274490750651217
0	 There are, of course, other factors that contribute to the high price of higher education, but staff	0.4340735858995235
0	 and buildings are the big two. Then now why higher education has become three times as expensive. It is	0.4431653914888192
0	 always been expensive to pay highly educated people to teach in inefficiently used buildings,	0.45495106540086927
0	 So what has changed in the last 30 years? Well, higher education is more popular than ever. In	0.4651733335898922
0	 in the past 20 years the number of registrations has increased by 50%. Support from the government	0.4763336452127314
0	 for colleges has also risen to record high since 1980, but with the simultaneous	0.4886965766225145
0	 increase in the number of students, the converted support per student is at a low point. Ohio paid in 1990	0.500001202619787
0	 flagship of universities - Ohio State University - 25% of their public money budget,	0.5142859204491064
0	 while in 2012 only 7% of their budget was paid by the government. With less government money	0.5284070819874014
0	 students have to pay more out of their own pocket to make up for the difference. Added to this	0.5427182574520335
0	 colleges have adapted to be attractive to the new generation. According to William Strauss and	0.5551749932051983

0	 results and they feel special. Millennials are also sometimes called 'trophy children'	0.5910395204914386
0	 and are generally more ambitious and feel more unique than the previous generation, which means	0.6015985222208058
0	 that they believe more in 'the right match' when choosing a study. Colleges responded	0.6108322369449609
0	 to this new attitude by adding more and more facilities to stand out more for	0.6211747671126783
0	 the growing number of students. All these new facilities had to be managed, which contributes	0.6304613971074589
0	 to the explosion in administration at universities. According to the US Department of Education	0.642030599457859
0	 the number of administrative jobs increased by 60% between 1993 and 2009. That is 10 times	0.6531644534453854

0	 Just as I finished my video 'Why Fly So Expensive' with the announcement that	0.6765217349474094

0	know so what happens here is there's a	0.40168879834438764

0	there's an OLED panel with its substrate	0.42422761904322936

0	more of the fallout around the parkland shooting and then some of the just insanity and	0.009145116940093305
0	Ridiculousness that we've seen around this story. The first part of this is something that actually happened as yesterday's show was going on yesterday 100	0.015612609550880011
0	students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School traveled seven hours to the Florida House of	0.02165683154653402
0	Representatives to watch a vote. This because the house was voting on a motion for debate on a bill that could ban the sale of assault	0.02531384846706007
0	weapons and ultimately in just three minutes the House voted down the motion 71 to 36	0.03006045251851165
0	just so you understand the full situation here the bill would have banned large capacity magazines also labelling weapons such as the	0.03466493650940773
0	Ar-15 as assault weapons and then banned that was actually assigned to three committees in the house	0.040174663494711695
0	but those committees weren't actually scheduled to meet again before the	0.04470602774430747
0	Legislative session ends on March 9 and that essentially meant the bill was dead unless the House voted to open debate up again	0.04724874100163747
0	Which they did not,  then following the decision we saw the students there and attendance obviously upset lots of photos of students crying in the gallery	0.052615318070874655

0	If there is another mass shooting it's going to be their fault	0.07359347483548058

0	We can't even get a single debate vote or hearing on anything related to assault weapon now from this part of the story	0.10099792999042234
0	I just want to preface it with I am going to try and stay calm and	0.10575483259698665
0	Compose I can easily do that with the first part of the story	0.11070946746171512
0	It's a vote a lot of people have a lot of different opinions regarding gun laws	0.11366412292355382

0	But, this hasn't been fully confirmed yet.	0.14396887159533073
0	Also, according to reports the school had actually had a fire drill earlier in the day so many people did go into the hallways thinking it was the same thing.	0.14711876968686308
0	Others stayed in their classrooms because they thought it was weird to have another drill in the same day.	0.1578840096349824
0	Several students posted videos of the gunfire inside the school others called, and texted loved ones.	0.1652770057439318

0	As one student even responded:	0.21423012784880488
0	"By the way as we were running for our lives we were calling 911 to the point that they told us not to anymore."	0.2167129886974245
0	Also, you don't know how you're gonna react in a moment like that.	0.22512506948304614
0	I had a student reach out to me via Twitter in a closet.	0.22920140818973503
0	When I responded, "I said don't worry about anyone covering this story. Just make sure you're safe."	0.2342041875115805
0	Meanwhile, other reporters are trying into that person's DM.	0.24231980730035205

0	"I'm traumatized. I don't even remember tweeting you and I'm not sure why I did."	0.2515842134519177

0	You're disgusting!!	0.26896423939225494
0	But, back to the main story. The shootings happening at 2:53 P.M. Broward County Sheriff's Office tweets:	0.27033537150268666
0	"BSO is working a developing incident regarding a report of active shooters. Here's what we know so far:	0.27745043542708914
0	Deputies are responding to reports of a shooting at Stoneman Douglas High. There are reports of victims. PIO will be on scene 3:15 pm."	0.2847137298499166
0	As law enforcement arrives, they begin helping students flee the school. They start searching for the shooter.	0.29571984435797666
0	The shooter then reportedly fled the scene himself.	0.3036872336483231
0	He initially avoid the police detection by blending in with the other students who are running away.	0.3066147859922179
0	But, he luckily didn't get far, because police were able to identify the shooter using the school security cameras.	0.31332221604595145
0	And, this is just an hour after arriving on the scene, the police found the suspect a few miles away in a residential neighborhood.	0.3214748934593293
0	And, they end up arresting him without incident. The shooter so far has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.	0.32981285899573837
0	And, as of recording this video, a judge's denied him bail.	0.3393737261441542
0	And, since this happened yesterday, we have now learned background information.	0.3438947563461182
0	As mentioned earlier, we learned the shooter used in AR-15, which now we know ATF has confirmed the shooter legally purchased this year, and passed the required background check.	0.34905317769131
0	We also learned that the gunman had posted some disturbing images on social media, disturbing comments on Instagram, and YouTube.	0.36264591439688715
0	Also, specifically regarding the comments, reportedly the FBI had been made aware of threatening comments.	0.37279970353900316
0	This thanks to 36-year-old YouTuber, Ben Bennight.	0.38243468593663144
0	He reportedly alerted the FBI with a screenshot. He also called their Mississippi office.	0.38614044839725775
0	A comment which featured the shooter's name back in September reading:	0.39447841393366684
0	"I'm going to be a professional school shooter."	0.39955530850472487
0	According to Ben, they did an in-person interview with him the very next day, saying:	0.40292755234389477
0	"They came to my office the next morning and asked me if I knew anything about the person."	0.40800444691495275
0	"I didn't. They took a copy of the screenshot and that was the last I heard from them."	0.4133778024828608
0	And then, at a news conference this morning, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Rob Lasky, spoke about this:	0.4193070224198629
0	"In 2017, the FBI received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel."	0.42690383546414673
0	"The common comment simply said, 'I'm going to be a professional school shooter.'"	0.43564943487122476
0	"No other information was included with that comment, which would indicate a time, location for the true identity of the person who made the comment."	0.44861960348341673
0	"The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment."	0.4667407819158792
0	Although, there has been criticism to the FBI's response there, because the YouTube comment literally had the shooter's name on it.	0.48397257735779137
0	It's also been reported by media, and a very important note here, not confirmed by law enforcement yet that the shooter left several other troubling comments, including:	0.4949045766166389
0	"I wanna to shoot people with my AR-15."	0.507615341856587
0	"I want to die fighting killing shit ton of people."	0.5113952195664258
0	"I'm going to kill law enforcement one day they go after the good people."	0.5157680192699649
0	As far as why the shooter was a former student, reportedly he was expelled from the high school for disciplinary reasons last year.	0.5199184732258663
0	That said there aren't confirmed details about the reason for his expulsion right now.	0.5299240318695572
0	We've also seen other students describing him as troubled with few friends.	0.5349268111914026
0	One student even saying:	0.5406336853807671
0	"Honestly a lot of people were saying that it was going to be him, a lot of kids threw jokes around like that, saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out you know, everyone predicted it. That's crazy."	0.5427830276079303
0	We also learned today that the shooter was a member of a White Nationalist Organization.	0.5560496572169724
0	They're called, "The Republic of Florida."	0.5623494534000371
0	They say they consider themselves, "a white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics."	0.5647211413748379
0	Adding, "The ultimate creation of a white ethnos state so we can be free from anti-white policies and have policies that reflect our values as white westerners."	0.5741337780248286
0	And, we know that, because a Captain for the Republic of Florida said:	0.5858810450250139
0	""ROF hosted a "paramilitary" training session in the Tallahassee area that he attended.""	0.591106170094497
0	"He probably used that training to do what he did yesterday."	0.5976283120251992
0	"Nobody I know told him to do that. He just freaked out."	0.6011117287381879
0	Adding, "I know he knew full well he was joining a white separatist paramilitary proto-fascist organization. I know he knew that much."	0.6053177691309987
0	And, following this situation, we're kind of seeing the, "same gun reform dance," that we always see after something like this.	0.6168241615712433
0	Many people saying we need gun reform, and obviously here, it's varying levels.	0.6283120251991847
0	You've people who are calling for a full outright ban of all guns to people just talking about mental health, access things, like that.	0.6346118213822494
0	Right. And then, a lot of people in the middle of that range.	0.6468408375023161
0	Then, you have people on the other end of things saying more guns.	0.6498054474708171
0	That's what we actually need because when you create gun-free zones like a school, you're actually just creating a target.	0.6539003149898092
0	And then, finally, you have the third group which I personally I will just throw this out there just for transparency sake, I find the most infuriating.	0.6638873448211969
0	Tomi Lahren's of the world who say that it's too soon to talk about it.	0.6760793033166574
0	I saw one of her all-encompassing Tweets she put out yesterday, reading:	0.6811191402631092
0	"Can the left let the families grieve for even 24 hours before they push their anti-gun and anti-gun owner agenda? My goodness. This isn't about a gun it's about another lunatic."	0.6866777839540485
0	Here's the thing a conversation of how do we make sure less people get murdered?!	0.6997591254400592
0	Less children are killed?!	0.7072818232351307
0	That we shouldn't be like, "let's wait."	0.7106170094496943
0	Talk about how to prevent further death shouldn't be a partisan issue.	0.7144710024087456
0	One, for damn sure, the person that shot off this school was a dreamer, was an illegal immigrant, a refugee, 100% within 24 hours, Tomi Lahren would be sounding off.	0.720585510468779
0	Which is why, two, I think that we need to have a conversation as fast as possible, no matter what.	0.7370761534185659
0	If someone shoots of a school, let's immediately talk about guns, and potential solutions.	0.7441171020937558
0	If an illegal immigrant, or refugee was the shooter, let's also talk about border security, and immigration policy.	0.7504168982768205
0	Let's say that illegal immigrant, or refugee didn't use a gun, maybe they ran people over with a van, then let's still talk about border security, and immigration policy.	0.76023716879748
0	We should be talking about any, and all key aspects contributing factors that led to the death of innocence.	0.7717250324254216
0	Why are we picking, and choosing when murder matters?!	0.780248286084862
0	And, I say this is someone that used to say the same thing that people I now find infuriating say, "You know let's wait before we talk about this."	0.7846952010376135
0	No. Because it just keeps happening- and-happening-and-happening, and when we need to talk about solutions as fast as possible.	0.796792662590328
0	Prevention is all about getting in front of something. The timing is incredibly important.	0.8061886233092459
0	And, as far as this section, I'm not saying what's right, and what's wrong, but we need to talk about solutions. That's my main point.	0.8130442838614045
0	But, where I want to close this story, is on people like Aaron Fies.	0.8241615712432833
0	Aaron was a football coach, and a security guard at the school. He reportedly stepped in front of students, and was shot shielding them from gunfire.	0.8289790624420975
0	He ended up being rushed to a hospital. He ended up dying there.	0.8404669260700389
0	A spokeswoman for the school saying, "He died the same way -- he lived he put himself second."	0.8449138410227904
0	Also adding, "He was a very kind soul, a very nice man. He died a hero."	0.8528441726885306
0	That's who I want to feature, and show, and name in this video, not that murdering trash bag.	0.8591810264962015
0	People like Aaron Feis. People like Scott Beagle. Other people's names are now coming through.	0.8667778395404855
0	Scott was the 35-year-old geography teacher.	0.8734482119696128
0	According to reports, while the shooter was active in the hallway, he unlocked the door to his room to get other students to safety.	0.8769686863072077
0	Unfortunately, before Scott was able to get back to the room, he was shot, and killed.	0.8886418380581804
0	Also, I think it's incredibly important, we think of, thank, and send lots of love to law enforcement, and first responders on the scene.	0.8942004817491199
0	And also, looking at the names, and pictures of the young kids that were killed.	0.9038354641467482
0	Because it's incredibly important to remember that this happened to real people.	0.9108764128219381
0	Stories like this they quickly become about numbers, statistics.	0.9164350565128775
0	He starts seeing spreadsheets, and you lose the human element.	0.921734296831573
0	Children died. Adults died.	0.928478784509913
0	And, every second, we don't talk about how to prevent the next one of theses happening?!	0.9316286826014453
0	Or, we're doing all of these people a disservice.	0.9401889938854919
0	But, that's where I'm gonna end the story in today's show. I do want to - I want to pass a question off to you.	0.9449694274596998
0	What is - What is your feeling around this?!	0.9539373726144155
0	I know. I know. I normally do though you know, "subscribe, like thing." We don't need that today.	0.9583101723179545
0	If you've got people in your life today, if they're right there with you, give them a hug.	0.9668315730961645
0	Let them know you love them.	0.9737261441541597
0	If they're not with you, send them a text, give them a phone call, a FaceTime, or whatever.	0.9753937372614415
0	Just-Just love someone while you have them.	0.9830276079303316
0	The world is a stupid horrifying place where were you, or someone you love may not be here tomorrow.	0.9868445432647768
0	So, just-just love people while you have them.	0.9955530850472485
0	And, with that said, my name is Philip DeFranco. I love your faces, and I will see you tomorrow.	1.0

0	And the first thing I wanna talk about today, one of the more requested stories of the day.	0.0075222775141766
0	Let's talk about this situation around LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Laura Ingraham.	0.010762643212591134
0	On February 15th LeBron James, Kevin Durant do an interview.	0.014851676117733288
0	It was a segment for a show called "Uninterrupted".	0.0172626625004822

0	the country, other social issues.	0.021139528603942446
0	and in that video interview, we see this:	0.02283686301739768
0	The number one job in America	0.024572773212976892
0	the point of person, is someone who doesn't understand the people.	0.02754310843652355
0	and really don't give a fuck about the people	0.031381398757859814
0	when we talkin' about leadership and what's goin' on in our country	0.03369594568529877
0	it's all about leadership	0.03737993287813911
0	and I learned that playing basketball, you know? I learned a lot of life skills from playing basketball	0.03896153994522239
0	you need that power of people, you need to, you know, encourage people, and that's what	0.04260695135593874
0	builds a great team and I feel like our team as a, as a country, is not ran by a great coach	0.04634880222196505
0	it's not even a surprise when he says somethin'	0.05203873008525248
0	it's not even surprise, it's like laughable, it's like-	0.05446900435906338
0	it's laughable	0.05699571808818424
0	and it's scary	0.057960112641283805
0	and in response to that, later that night, Fox news host Laura Ingraham criticized the players	0.05900165875863133
0	saying LeBron's comments were barely intelligible, they were ungrammatical, adding	0.06291613624966247
0	here's this barely intelligible, not to mention ungrammatical, take on president Trump	0.06652393627280793
0	in a new ESPN podcast	0.07231030359140532
0	I'm numb to this commentary, like	0.07441268371716236
0	must they run their mouths like that?	0.07630289704123751
0	unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take this ignorant comments seriously	0.0776530494155769
0	look, there might be a cautionary lesson	0.08235929483470278
0	in LeBron for kids	0.0845195386336458
0	this is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA	0.08598541835435713
0	and it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year	0.09101955792153686
0	to bounce a ball	0.09618871272615052
0	oh and LeBron and Kevin, you're great players, but no one voted for you	0.09688307680438221
0	millions elected Trump to be their coach	0.10033560930447864
0	so keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said	0.10261158044979361
0	shut up and dribble	0.10602553716776608
0	and following this we saw a lot of big reactions online	0.10724067430467153
0	some saying, yeah, Laura's right, stick to basketball	0.10926590286618061
0	don't talk about politics	0.11161902557574355
0	others saying no, these guys are just embracing their freedom of speech	0.11293060216795896
0	they're giving their opinion on something	0.11557304324345176
0	some going as far to say Ingraham's comments were racist	0.11719322609265903
0	we then saw Ingraham respond to those allegations of racism	0.11933418200054006
0	and ultimately her defense is I've told people to shut up and blank for years	0.12184160783859893
0	saying	0.12492670601396444
0	following this we saw LeBron responding over the weekend	0.14747521505998534
0	we will definitely not, uh, shut up and dribble	0.15032982293716005
0	I would definitely not do that, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to the, to the- to so many kids	0.15274080931990897
0	that feel like they don't have a, um, they don't have a way out	0.1566369633144312
0	and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they're in	0.15879720711337422
0	also, I wish she would've did a little bit more fact checking because I actually did	0.16207614859391273
0	finish high school and didn't leave early	0.16558654476719514
0	I graduated high school	0.16724530339852642
0	the best thing she did is gonna help me, is create more awareness	0.16840257686224588
0	and I get, I get to sit up here and talk about social injustice, equality, and why a woman on	0.1717008062338464
0	a certain network decided to tell me to shut up and, and dribble	0.17847085599660534
0	and as far as my personal response to this	0.18165335802183388
0	uh, uh, I, I'm not even gonna touch the, you know, the intention, was it racism, blah, blah, blah part	0.18327354087104117
0	but I do think Laura Ingraham's point is ridiculous as well as- considering that she is on Fox news	0.1876133163599892
0	and the guests they bring on Fox news, it's very hypocritical	0.1922616981059291
0	I'll hit specifics on that point in a second	0.19544420013115765
0	1: I think it's ridiculous to disqualify someone's opinion on something because of their job	0.1966400493770011
0	or the amount of money they make	0.20092196119276318
0	before Donald Trump was president, he said he had billions, we know that he had at least hundreds of millions of dollars	0.2020020830922347
0	yes he was a businessman, but he was also a reality TV star	0.20630328279905874
0	just because he wasn't elected at that time	0.20898429965667553
0	doesn't mean that Donald Trump's opinions and reactions on things should've been disqualified	0.21043089148632488
0	using your same argument, we could also say why should we care what Laura says	0.21409559078810322
0	she wasn't elected	0.2170466381205879

0	no, you can play basketball	0.2451105196157852
0	so for Laura to have that opinion, I just feel like it's ridiculous	0.24636423253481465

0	what are your thoughts on this?	0.25076090730239553
0	then let's talk about Black Panther for two reasons	0.2517831655286811

0	make me care about almost all the characters, even secondary characters	0.2717085213902712
0	and Michael B Jordan is a fantastic villain with a fantastic back story	0.27485244763337574
0	for me personally when it comes to these kind of movies, how good the movie is often depends on	0.2785364348262161
0	the bad guy	0.28222042201905645
0	like some comic book movies can power through not having a really good bad guy	0.2829147860972881
0	like Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel like it's had a bad guy problem	0.28646375805269453
0	but you just watch the first movie, it's just so fun, like the, the main five are so great	0.2891640628013733
0	and with Black Panther, Michael B Jordan just kills it at being Kill Monger	0.29259730741040774
0	that said, I can understand people's criticisms about certain things	0.29616556725687615
0	like the green screen	0.2983836747290051
0	some, some pacing issues depending on your personal preference	0.2993866450642287
0	predictability, but then you could argue it's about the ride	0.30237626817883734
0	so there's that side of it, but then there was also the fake news side of it	0.30434363306716045
0	over the last few days, some social media users have claimed that they were attacked while going to screenings	0.3072753925085831

0	for example	0.31863596034409597
0	and there are more and more posts	0.33923542799830264
0	but you get the example	0.3401612467692782
0	that said, if you, if you are familiar with the Rob Porter story that we talked about	0.3409520503028199
0	uh, you know that was Rob Porter's wife in one of those pictures	0.34463603749566024

0	they've suspended some of the accounts	0.35725031825020254
0	but if you go online right now, there's still people spreading this fake news	0.35838830382286

0	in this country	0.36535123249623885

0	and if you're aunts and uncles are sharing this because they didn't look into it	0.3767503761138757

0	uh, Handmaid's Tale	0.4156926281680361
0	uh, Future Man	0.4173706746904293
0	but something I haven't done in a very long time is to recommend a video game	0.41823862978821896
0	and that is finally coming to an end	0.4214018439223855

0	it also has a fantastic soundtrack, one that I love so much, I actually listen to that while I research stories	0.4360220653473749
0	and of course, are there better games in the world?	0.4410947806966786
0	yes, but this is one of the last ones that just kind of fell in front of me	0.44259923619951397
0	and I just wanted to share it	0.4457624503336805
0	then we had other awesome including the director of Black Panther, Brian Coogler	0.4471126027080199
0	kind of just walking us through a fight scene	0.4503336805153724
0	more Slo Mo Guys awesome	0.4524360606411295
0	we had Life Noggin asking which animal is the smartest	0.4538633645797169
0	and if you wanna see the full versions of everything I just shared, the secret link of the day	0.4561779115071558
0	anything at all, links as always are in the description down below	0.4589939436022065
0	and then let's talk about the fall out from the Parkland Florida school shooting	0.4619064151525672
0	this mass shooting of course involving a former student bringing an AR-15 to the school	0.464568144119122
0	killing 17, injuring many others	0.46840643444045826
0	and many people were looking for who to blame other than just the shooter	0.4705666782394013
0	of course there's a conversation to be had around gun laws, specifically what you can have	0.473382710334452
0	background checks, things like that	0.47691239439879646
0	right, people asking questions like why is it that in Florida you have to be 21 years old	0.47860972881225167
0	you have to go through a 3 day background check to get a hand gun	0.48242873124252594
0	but if you opt instead to buy an AR-15, seemingly a much more deadly weapon	0.48483971762527484
0	you only have to be 18 years old and you just go in, if you, if you pass a quickie background check	0.4880222196505034
0	you're gonna be out in minutes	0.4922462677930795
0	but at the same time, you had people placing blame elsewhere	0.49328781391042703
0	you had Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast blaming who he called the biggest pusher of violence	0.4953516182540601
0	what do we do with the biggest pusher of violence, the biggest pusher of violence is hands down	0.49969139374300814
0	Hollywood movies, hands down the video game market	0.5068279134359449
0	when you look at Call of Duty, when you look at movies like John Wick	0.5101454306986074
0	the societal impacts of people being desensitized to killing in ways that are different than	0.5140994483663156
0	how somebody that was on the battlefield was desensitized is troubling	0.5196543609921691
0	also it's important to note, Brian Mast is not alone	0.5232419087296994
0	we had Matt Bevin, he's a Republican Governor from Kentucky, he's endorsed by the NRA	0.5258843498051923
0	and he said this	0.5295297612159087
0	and then you look at the culture of death that is being celebrated	0.5303012768583883
0	there are video games that yes are listed for mature audiences, but kids play them and everybody knows it	0.5346989160205223
0	and there's nothing to prevent the child from playing them	0.5406395864676157
0	it celebrates the slaughtering of peop- there are games that literally replicate	0.5431663001967365
0	and give people the ability to score points for doing the very same things that these students are doing	0.5484318944566601
0	inside of schools	0.5538903676272037
0	where you get extra points for finishing someone off	0.5550476410909231
0	who's lying there begging for their life	0.55763221849323
0	these are quote unquote video games and they're forced down our throats under the guise of protected speech	0.5596381591636771
0	it's garbage	0.566388921035374
0	it's the same as pornography	0.5671797245689156
0	we also had people like CNN political commentator hitting some of these same notes	0.568607028507503
0	but then also blaming rap music	0.5716738031863596
0	we have a culture thing here that we're not discussing, I mean when I, when I grew up, it was	0.5731589707981329
0	Andy Griffith, you never had school shootings, and we still had prayer in school	0.5768236700999113
0	and we drove to school with guns in the, in the car	0.5803726420553177
0	I say we, I would see students that did that	0.5832079620414304
0	today we are at a different time when the me- not the media but movie industry, the rap industry	0.5853103421671875
0	radio in general talks about these things that	0.5910774215947229
0	are common now and we have almost desensitized them	0.5939706052540216
0	and it's incredibly annoying to me that I have to say the same thing that I have to say every time some politician	0.5970373799328781
0	decides to blame movies and video games and rap music	0.6013000038575782
0	every time after a tragedy like this	0.6040388843883809
0	the research doesn't back that up	0.6061605524052001
0	like with any topic, if you search long enough, you can find a site or some research that says what you think	0.6075107047795394
0	right, there are studies on both sides that say, you know, video games do cause people to be violent	0.6114647224472476
0	no they don't	0.6157080584808857
0	but if you look at a lot of the newer research, those using better methods, you find that there, there's very minimal	0.6164024225591174
0	if any connection whatsoever to violent video games and violence in real life	0.6211279558693052
0	it also seemingly doesn't answer the question why these other countries that have violent video games	0.6249469582995795
0	and, and rap music and violent movies	0.6285730818192339
0	why they don't have simliar issues	0.6308683408556108
0	and pretty much anyone that has ever played a game where you kill someone	0.6322956447941982
0	will tell you it did not make them go 'yeah, I'll do this in real life now'	0.6353624194730548
0	right?	0.6381977394591676
0	and to like a lesser degree, when I played Pokemon, it didn't make me go	0.6386799367357173
0	you know, it'd be great to just make animals fight each other for my entertainment	0.6411102110095283
0	and to me it's just a ridiculous argument, I get why people believe it	0.6443698645990047
0	be- especially if they haven't played games, because it offers a simple solution	0.6469351541102496
0	an explination	0.6501755198086642
0	but just, no	0.6509277475600818
0	what these people are saying is backed by their feelings and their beliefs	0.6516992632025614
0	but not by facts	0.6544960074065501
0	and it's really disgusting to me that these three would run what I would just see as a distraction campaign	0.6553446746132778
0	we have a real problem in this country and we need to have a conversation to come up with solutions	0.6599159047949698
0	and on the note of finding solutions, we of course have to ask the question of where do we get the solutions	0.6628862400185164
0	we can look to the White House, but the situation seems iffy at best	0.6672838791806504
0	we have seen the president talk about this being a mental health problem	0.6697334413455233
0	we've seen him praise local law enforcement	0.6721637156193342
0	we also saw him tweet over the weekend	0.6743432473093391
0	and this is connected to a story I want to talk about much more later this week	0.6858966940554719
0	and that is the indictment of 13 Russians, 3 Russian nationals	0.6887898777147706
0	Trump's response to the 37 page indictment was 'hey this proves there was no collusion,we're vindicated'	0.6914130308992015
0	this because the indictment read	0.6956177911507155
0	but also on that note, you had people noting that this is not the end of Muller's investigation	0.6997068240558577
0	and this indictment seems to be just one facet of the Russian situation	0.7038730085252478
0	this being the specific situation of organized Russians trying to cause chaos online using social media	0.7070555105504764
0	but like I said, I wanna do a deeper dive on that later this week	0.7118581954249122
0	and I just wanted to give you some background context for that tweet	0.7140570150059793
0	and with that background understood, it appears the president is saying becuse the FBI	0.7165065771708521
0	was focused on Russia, that is why procedure wasn't followed when the FBI was warned	0.7197662307603286
0	about the shooter in this incident in January	0.723604521081665
0	so we had that version of the president on Twitter over the weekend, and then this morning	0.7257647648806079
0	Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said this	0.7293330247270764
0	so that does seem like a positive, pro gun, anti gun people I talked to, most are still onboard	0.7438760945878178
0	with better background checks	0.7483508853141998
0	that said, when you glance at the main version of this bill that people talk about, there doesn't seem to be anything	0.7494117193226093
0	in this bill that would've stopped this Parkland Florida shooting	0.7536743432473093
0	and for some background, this was called the Fix the NICS Act, it was later merged	0.7561239054121822
0	with the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017	0.7592678316552868
0	it actually passed the House last year	0.7619102727307796
0	it's currently in the Senate	0.763453304015739
0	it's also supported by the NRA	0.7644562743509624
0	and reportedly	0.7658642903984878
0	this including convicted criminals, people who were dishonorably discharged	0.7703583690159318
0	and understandably the bill was built this way because it came after Southerland Springs	0.7735408710411603
0	that you might remember is the Texas shooting that resulted in 26 people being killed	0.7771862824518767
0	here's the thing, this actually wouldn't've stopped the Parkland shooter	0.7811210122285229
0	he did pass an NICS background check	0.7835705743933958
0	he wasn't a convicted criminal	0.785576515063843
0	he wasn't dishonorably discharged	0.7869845311113682
0	and as far as who's speaking out the most and the loudest about what to do next, it's actually the	0.7886818655248236
0	survivors of the school shooting	0.7926744589746557
0	on Saturday we saw students from Marjory Stowman Douglass High School holding a rally	0.794217490259615
0	they gathered together to protest current gun laws, speak out in the wake of last week's shooting	0.7973807043937816
0	the 5 that you have likely seen at this point	0.8010261158044979
0	you have David Hogg, Alex Winn, Cameron Kasky, Jaclyn Corin, and Emma Gonzalez	0.8027620260000772
0	and Emma Gonzlez has become one of the main faces of this movement thanks to a speech	0.8070632257069013
0	that she gave over the weekend that has just blown up	0.8104964703159356
0	where she took aim at politicians and then specifically Trump	0.8128688809165606
0	if the president wants to come up to me	0.8153955946456815
0	and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy	0.8172279442965706
0	and how it should never have happened	0.8197353701346295
0	and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it	0.8217413108050766
0	I'm gonna happily ask him how much money he received from the National Riffle Association	0.8257531921459708
0	(cheering)	0.8303437102187247
0	it doesn't matter because I already know	0.8313273926628862
0	$30 million dollars	0.8344906067970528
0	politicians who sit in their guilded house and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling	0.8365929869228098
0	us nothing could've ever been done to prevent this	0.8419164448559194
0	we call BS	0.8440766886548625
0	(cheering)	0.8457354472861938
0	we say that- they say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence	0.8488793735292983
0	we call BS	0.8536241947305482
0	they say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun	0.8558615900937392
0	we call BS	0.8594298499402075

0	 Here's an interesting question: Paris, France and New York, USA	0.009404126436973945
0	 Which city do you think the population is more dense?	0.016800254346480147
0	 The answer may seem obvious: New York, skyscraper kingdom, Big Apple ... right?	0.019644918927059454
0	 error.	0.03236224293435518
0	 In fact, New York's population density is less than half that of Paris.	0.03452084135138301
0	 Paris lives 56,000 people per square mile (22,000 per square kilometer)	0.041649236123893506
0	 New York City, with only 27,000 people per square mile (10500 square kilometers per square kilometer)	0.0496310302705778
0	 To find a comparable European city with New York (the most densely populated city in the United States)	0.05523669282642526
0	 You have to see the sixth in Europe: Lyon, France	0.06323522029417178
0	 (27 000 per square meter / mile; 10500 per square kilometer.)	0.0721373470992788
0	 Of course, New York has a super dense metropolitan core, but it is surrounded by an endless stretch of suburbs,	0.07381067920550191
0	 Just like almost any other American city.	0.08197486655176453
0	 On the other hand, virtually all of Paris's population is concentrated in the center of a compact city	0.08784993557671392
0	 There is another interesting pattern between the two continents:	0.09713692876625224
0	 In the United States, the affluent lives in cities, while affluent Europeans live in the city center.	0.10408293033918442
0	 Compare the income maps for Paris and Philadelphia.	0.11303191044326567
0	 Of course, this is a bit rough, but you can really see such a pattern,	0.1180351734408728
0	 The most commonly cited reason for these two different trends is the difference in urban age.	0.12422817556600459
0	 Most European cities have existed for hundreds or even thousands of years,	0.13102023058516424
0	 While some American cities have reached the size of what can be called the city's population,	0.13940697110155453
0	 However, the past one or two hundred years.	0.14807315807968408
0	 This also means that in those times when the super-rich must commute by foot,	0.15096634929134387
0	 European cities already exist.	0.15831395056976957
0	 In the Middle Ages, Paris had between 20 and 300,000 people,	0.16050601562892186
0	 But you can still walk from one end of the city to the other within 30 minutes,	0.1694750757182778
0	 The population is incredibly dense.	0.1751627315473302
0	 At that time, people must live within walking distance,	0.1797309281973193
0	 Therefore, the rich pay more to live closer to the city center,	0.18478439115811315
0	 A similar reason may explain why the historic European hotel	0.19233111895717944
0	 The best, largest rooms you will often see are usually on the lower floors, as opposed to what you see today.	0.20034637974598818
0	 Before the elevator was invented, the wealthy did not want to climb so many stairs on foot.	0.20809390739780123
0	 Before the elevator was invented, the rich do not want to walk, climb so many stairs.	0.2148876357490671
0	 Walking distance is not only important in big cities,	0.21712822743929988
0	 Small villages in Europe are almost always the same size,	0.222101370458995
0	 This is because their population is determined by the extent to which their surroundings can be reached by foot	0.23130469704322218
0	 European farmers tend to live in small towns and walk to their fields for work,	0.23771355901005672
0	 This is different from the situation in which American peasants generally hold a manor.	0.24546108666186978
0	 So here's the village	0.25027860979568617
0	 It will only be as large as people can walk to the field only by foot.	0.2564699385887117
0	 On the other hand, in the more modern era, the decentralized technology has become more advanced,	0.26154013487056776
0	 American cities have also started their rapid growth period.	0.2688877361489935
0	 As North American cities become larger and larger than people can walk,	0.2771874633958602
0	 There is already enough technology to build a public transport system.	0.283845651846522
0	 There is already enough technology to build a public transport system.	0.2907916534194542
0	 The first major public transport innovation was the steam train in the mid-19th century.	0.2927996519469219
0	 This is a very expensive mode of transportation, so only the super rich can use it.	0.30183397198842055
0	 Interestingly, because the steam train takes a long time to accelerate,	0.3115577048576831
0	 As a commune for the rich people to use the town, which is called the suburbs of the railway,	0.319439099077994
0	 It is not usually the nearest village, but a few miles from the city.	0.32666622044477167
0	 The impact of the suburbs of the railway still exists today,	0.33628955338766087
0	 In the old Philadelphia Railway, there is a rich community extension.	0.3411254831746457
0	 From Ardmore to Malvern, there are huge manor and country clubs.	0.348185271330801
0	 There has been no change in the demographics since the suburbs of the railway.	0.3543598668027643
0	 Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States.	0.36147320158631885
0	 Decades later, trams appeared and quickly became an important tool for commuting in the United States.	0.3707434614547949
0	 Like steam trains, trams also create new communities	0.3726008600927026
0	 This time there is not much money for the upper middle class.	0.3798798547547732
0	 In the affluent suburbs of Washington, DC, Tenley town, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, McLean, Rockville	0.38491658439450477
0	 Are formed with the tram appeared.	0.3938672378306923
0	 But again, walking distance affects geography,	0.39979250681882833
0	 Tramcar commuters have to live within walking distance of tram stops,	0.4075065678285169
0	 So people naturally focus on walking to the tram station takes 20 to thirty minutes away,	0.41480229581164973
0	 Exceed this range ...... Nothing at all	0.42366928264252607
0	 This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute.	0.42766854637639934
0	 This means that there is a lot of open space between tram lines where no one can commute.	0.4345794079751008
0	 Then the car debut.	0.4362527400813239
0	 At first, cars were used only by the upper classes, especially when the United States was also distracted by the two wars and the Great Depression	0.4396010776258764
0	 However, the young Americans later returned from the battlefields of World War II,	0.44669600575626245
0	 At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford.	0.45501246632419134
0	 At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford.	0.4621408610967019
0	 By 1950, more than 50% of families owned cars.	0.4657552584461438
0	 In the meantime, the government provided loans to veterans,	0.47177925402854703
0	 This has significantly increased the population that the United States can afford to buy.	0.47905824869061764
0	 Instead of buying a small downtown real estate, this generation chose to use their new car commute	0.48573484379444787
0	 In order to live in the suburbs, cheaper and better bigger house.	0.49376683790431886
0	 The idea was that working parents would go to urban areas every day,	0.5004601663292113
0	 The rest of the family will stay to enjoy the suburbs.	0.506651495122237
0	 This is the perfect deal.	0.5109703652883988
0	 Although this whole history is absolutely true, it does not fully explain why	0.5138635565000585
0	 European cities do not experience suburbanization.	0.5227656833051656
0	 In Germany, many can even say most cities	0.5273673465972791
0	 In World War II was bombed into ruins,	0.5362025401181373
0	 They have the opportunity to rebuild their community in any way,	0.5378758722243604
0	 But they chose to maintain a high density design.	0.546242532755476
0	 At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States.	0.5485182644199394
0	 At present, the average population density of German metropolises is four times higher than that of the United States.	0.557604457756731
0	 In the meantime, other European cities survived the war,	0.5593949231103897
0	 Mass influx, but still maintain a huge population density.	0.5671926507253895
0	 Crime may be the least cited reason for suburbanization in the United States.	0.5762621107411188
0	 We sometimes forget, but this is a somewhat uglier period in American history	0.5836415053295627
0	 The crime rate was crazy in the 70s, 80s and 90s.	0.591608239487291
0	 There are innumerable different theories to explain this, but perhaps the most interesting one is	0.5991030939910644
0	 Higher leaded car exhaust contributes to lower IQ and higher aggression.	0.6057796890948947
0	 In 1990, New York reached as many as 2,245 astronomical murders,	0.6161878147956025
0	 London did not have as much in the entire 1990s.	0.6271314067703017
0	 In the United States, the rate of violent crime continues to be ten times higher than in Britain.	0.6337076019477585
0	 In 1992, a poll asked people moving out of New York why they were moving to the suburbs.	0.6438479945114707
0	 The most common reason cited is "crime", reaching 47%.	0.6537039206171249
0	 "Cost and quality of life" is as low as 10%.	0.6613677816636268
0	 Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.	0.6702531751476716
0	 Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.	0.678318635899667
0	 Europeans do not need to worry too much about such crimes in cities,	0.6809457673064373
0	 So they are more willing to live in the city center.	0.6871705627415873
0	 The land on the American suburbs is also more readily available,	0.6909188266595271
0	 Because farmers are always quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.	0.6982480212847844
0	 In contrast, France's agricultural subsidies per acre	0.7058114824049129
0	 12 times higher than the United States.	0.7156506751895049
0	 This is one of the big reasons why a large number of European cities are still surrounded by small farms.	0.7174913405063503
0	 In many European cities, you can really take the city bus to the farm.	0.7276149997490002
0	 In the end, all kinds of energy are cheaper in the United States.	0.73556332725356
0	 And in some European countries, a gallon of gasoline sold for $ 7,	0.741855055972959
0	 The United States on average only $ 2.20.	0.7523301149579157
0	 It is significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe, so Europeans have a higher incentive to live closer to the office,	0.7548735797593749
0	 Well, driving a short time, you can take the public transport.	0.7649637723599003
0	 In addition, in Europe, electricity and heating costs are higher	0.7735479660648249
0	 Large suburban homes are usually not attractive.	0.7823831595856829
0	 However, suburban life did not meet everyone's expectations.	0.7858302237245026
0	 Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains.	0.7909840866116699
0	 Americans spend an average of 4.25 hours a week sitting in their cars, buses or trains.	0.8011746791385687
0	 This is 2.5% of their entire life.	0.805040076303944
0	 Science has also proven that commuting from the suburbs and higher blood pressure,	0.8102608724753602
0	 Lower frustration tolerance, and higher odds of anxiety.	0.8188952661434715
0	 In addition, the suburbs are no longer used to be country shelters,	0.8279312595170764
0	 They are just an extension of a city.	0.8345576546577199
0	 As a result, wealthy Americans began to return to cities,	0.8399290507186962
0	 With lower crime rates, rising fuel costs and changing perceptions,	0.8463713793276552
0	 The core of the city is ushering in revival.	0.8548551731062064
0	 This is why we live in our present place.	0.8572630980070615
0	 This is a complex, controversial, and surprising political history.	0.8626194340790817

0	Sup you beautiful bastards, hope you're having a fantastic Friday! Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show	0.0004706620646375902
0	And if you're new here, on Fridays we do things a little bit different.	0.006327789980127602
0	I try to cover more viewer requested stories, stories we were going to include,	0.009805459679949797
0	but for times sake to try and get out even remotely on time, we had to cut.	0.013832235121849178
0	So with that said, let's just jump into it	0.018120489488547224
0	and the first thing I want to talk about today is a very strange update around the Parkland, Florida shooting.	0.02065683505909424
0	It's one of the things we mentioned yesterday	0.026121744587386257
0	Is that there were reports that the shooter in this school shooting was actually connected to a white nationalist organization--an organization called Republic of Florida.	0.027690618136178225
0	It was all over the place, The Associated Press tweeting, "Breaking leader of white nationalist group has confirmed suspect in	0.03728689467628909
0	Florida school shooting was a member of his organization," and that person they're talking about is a guy	0.043039431021859635
0	by the name of Jordan Jereb. According to reports, he gave statements to multiple media outlets	0.04779834745319527
0	We also saw reports that there were first-hand confirmations from former students that he was a part of this organization	0.0528710385942893
0	So we had that, but then we got new information.	0.0595126032841753
0	Lieutenant Grady Jordan, who is a spokesperson for the Leon County Sheriff's Office in Tallahassee	0.06214046647840184
0	He said that his officers arrested militia leader Jordan Jereb at least four times since January 2014. They've been monitoring the group's membership,	0.0672262315657358
0	saying he has very solid information on the group	0.0751751908796151
0	There's no known ties that we have that we can connect the shooter with the group.	0.07773768434264199
0	So now we have law enforcement saying we're very knowledgeable of this group,	0.08257504445141721
0	we've been monitoring them, but we can't confirm any connection as of right now.	0.08534672105428302
0	So the question becomes how can we have Jordan Jereb doing all of these interviews and so when we have one part of the story	0.089451940173622
0	and then we're supposedly getting confirmation that former students are saying yes	0.0963288358958268
0	He was a part of the organization	0.10166169856709549
0	Well, according to new reports	0.10348028448907018
0	Jordan Jereb is now walking back his claims. An account attributed to Jordan Jereb on the social network, Gab, writing, "Those of you calling me a	0.10477460516682355
0	Fake white nationalist go fuck yourselves. There was a legit misunderstanding because we have multiple people name *omitted* in ROF.	0.11327267022278005
0	And I got a bunch of conflicting information, and I have not slept for like two days, and so when (((They)))	0.12059408011714255
0	[and also by the way if you ever see something with three parenthesis, they're talking about Jewish people]	0.12707875745214936
0	call me up and ask me yes-or-no questions, it's easy for them to misrepresent what I say.	0.13270055433532058
0	Are you really going to blame ME for the lying Jew media? We know they're liars. Fuck 'em."	0.13688421713209914
0	And as far as the other sources from ABC News	0.1421660914130321
0	That there are also reports that maybe that was just people on 4chan fucking with ABC News.	0.14454554962869992
0	So at least for this part of the story it looks like it's a mixture of people that were trying to fuck with the media,	0.1516577763832235
0	as well as someone that either was confused, or was just purposefully lying.	0.157227277481435
0	Also, it appears that the reason journalists even reached out to Jordan in the first place	0.16279677857964647
0	is because the anti-defamation league saw conversations on 4chan, but this explanation really doesn't make sense to me	0.16807865286057944
0	I mean I wouldn't be shocked to find out a white nationalist was a fucking idiot. Either that he was actually	0.17460255203430602
0	Confused which once again really does seem like a lie because there are several	0.18014590524003765
0	Statements that he reportedly gave to several media outlets or that he was a fucking idiot and that he thought this was a great way	0.18457797301537496
0	to get promotion for his organization	0.1905658403932643
0	or for himself which actually based off of other reporting from his past it does seem like he would do anything to get some attention	0.19198959313879302
0	although that still feels weird because you would think connecting a mass murderer to yourself or your	0.19959993724505803
0	organization would be bad news even with Jordan saying we didn't say to do this	0.2068951992469407
0	We don't support this,	0.21209862985043407
0	still looks bad but many a point I am still incredibly skeptical of all information around this specific aspect of the story,	0.21340602447442736
0	but I felt it incredibly important to update you guys because as I've stated before, I will always try to make sure the information I	0.22115887459470768
0	get in front of you is as accurate as possible and when we come across things that it turns out the reporting was bad or	0.2291209078548269
0	it was incorrect, or was part of a hoax	0.23661227905030854
0	I want to always make sure we update clarify and correct that and still for some reason this morning	0.23833673255935572
0	there are some outlets still running with the story despite the new information that has since come out now with that said I think it's	0.24402520656835058
0	incredibly important that we talk about the other updates around this story because while the republic of Florida angle the Jordan Jereb angle is	0.24983003869888087
0	actually an important part of the story now because it shows the potential pitfalls in	0.2569814872921243
0	reporting, the people knowingly trying to mislead the media	0.26211824076979395
0	and thus the public. Ultimately, the big reason why it was being reported on in the first place is to answer the question of	0.26571357598577555
0	why, and also who knew, also why did this happen could this have been stopped? Well, according to a new FBI	0.272068821253007
0	statement that came out today...	0.2782384164836314
0	Maybe. The FBI released a statement today saying, On January 5th	0.28004392845936615
0	2018, a person close to the shooter contacted the FBI's public access line tip line to report concerns about it. The caller provided information about	0.2843975525572639
0	the shooter's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a school	0.2934041941219538
0	shooting. Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life. The information then should have been	0.30195455496287
0	forwarded to the FBI Miami field office where appropriate	0.30979892270682985
0	investigative steps would have been taken. We have determined that these protocols were not followed for the information	0.3133419621378517
0	received by the PAL on January 5th. The information was not provided to the Miami Field Office and no further investigation	0.31938343269532476
0	was conducted at that time. FBI director Christopher Wray's saying we are still investigating the facts	0.3266786946972074
0	I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter as well as reviewing our	0.3325083673255936
0	processes for responding to information that we received from the public	0.337697416588223
0	It's up to all Americans to be vigilant and when members of the public contact us with concerns,	0.3409410626503504
0	we must act properly and	0.34588432172366906
0	quickly. We have spoken with victims and families and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy	0.3474401213262211
0	All of the men and women of the FBI are dedicated to keeping the American people safe and are relentlessly committed to improving all that we	0.3542385733709863
0	do and how we do it. And so with this new information I want to pass the question off to you	0.3617953142976676
0	What do you feel about this? What do you think? Then with the daily outrage news	0.36718178014852004
0	We had people angry at YouTube over this tweet reading "Roses are red, Violets are blue,	0.3716007739776174
0	Subscribe to black creators" and in response to this there were people supporting and retweeting and people saying yes,	0.37890910992574
0	this is great, the promotion of people subscribing to channels for an underrepresented community awesome	0.38438709340027194
0	We also had a lot of people saying this is racist, it's ridiculous, and some saying it's pandering. People are saying	0.39011348185336264
0	why are you telling people to subscribe to someone because of the color of their skin?	0.3965850852421295
0	Some of the people annoyed by this tweet included black YouTube creators like Skye Williams Skye essentially calling bullshit tweeting	0.4006249346302688
0	"I am a black creator. When I made a video discussing black issues, you flagged it, claimed	0.40725342537391485
0	I was quote	0.41196004602029074
0	Inciting racism against people of color struck my channel and took everything from me. Then your staff pretended to care by setting up a meeting	0.41291444409580585
0	that was due four months ago. Delete this." Adding. "You don't care about black creators,	0.42070651605480597
0	you care about docile black people who see a dumbass tweet like this and think it actually means something. You're creating your own black friends	0.4259230206045393
0	so you can prove you're not racist at dinner parties	0.4337281665097793
0	Delete this. We black readers are fucking fantastic with or without you and your soapbox.	0.4358199979081686
0	Don't tell people to fucking sub to me because I'm black I want people to sub to me because I'm a fucking excellent content creator.	0.4407227277481435
0	This shows you don't even watch black creators. Delete this, also hitting a note	0.4475734755778684
0	that a lot of other content creators hit as well tweeting	0.45173099048216714
0	"Subscribe to creators who make you laugh, who make you experience emotion, who value you as a fan, who	0.4545549628699927
0	challenges your way of thinking, who helps you cope when things get rough, who you relate to who inspires you and none of the	0.46119652755987867
0	aforementioned reasons are specific to race. Now, as far as my opinion on this, I kinda just didn't care.	0.46825645852944253
0	I just saw this is YouTube continuing their Black History Month push	0.47444043510093087
0	I mean head on to their Twitter page with hash tag create black history, their bio subscribe to black creators check the link in our	0.478127287940592
0	profile for a new feature channel every day this month. It is in general	0.48483422236167767
0	I've always looked at YouTube as kind of one of those organizations that seems to be competing in the woek Olympics	0.48848185336261896
0	and they're always going for gold and the cynical part of my brain thinks that the person that thought of this campaign feels like Khaleesi and	0.49542411881602344
0	that one memed scene. Also, from a marketing standpoint	0.5023663842694279
0	I think you'd got a lot less push back if you just featured creators	0.5050334693023742
0	and you didn't say just subscribe to this creator because of the color of their skin. One, racial groups already do that especially if they're	0.5088759021022905
0	underrepresented in mainstream media, I mean, just look at the Asian on YouTube	0.5158966112331346
0	It is thriving. It is just gonna happen naturally so to YouTube saying do it for this specific reason,	0.5210085242129484
0	it's not really gonna be helpful, but I also do understand	0.5281076770212321
0	why some people may be bothered by this,	0.5315199769898546
0	especially the Skye Williamses of the world. If I was in his position,	0.5336902520656835
0	I would 100% see this is an empty fake gesture, but that said I do want to pass a question off to you	0.5373248091203849

0	Well, that said, I do pass the question off to you	0.6585869678903881
0	What did you feel when you first saw this and also are you excited or?	0.6600630164208765
0	freaked out by it? I'd love to know where you're at and if you want to see the full versions of everything	0.6647696370672523
0	I just shared the secret link of the day anything at all links are always in the description down below.	0.6700122895094656
0	Then let's talk about South Africa's President Jacob Zuma who has stepped down this week.	0.675583098002301
0	To give you some background,	0.6803054073841648
0	he's been in power for nine years out of a 10 year term. Zuma has been a longtime member of the African National Congress	0.6817383118920615
0	Party (ANC) and he is very well known for being charismatic. He's a huge populist	0.6881471603388767
0	He's been very active in almost all aspects of his party from the militant wing in the early 60s	0.6934290346198096
0	which eventually led with him serving on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela all the way to become intelligence chief of the ANC under Mandela. From	0.6992730885890597
0	there, he eventually became the deputy president of South Africa,	0.7075488965589374
0	but then lost the position in	0.7106866436565212
0	2005 after being implicated in a fraud trial. Those fraud charges would end up being dropped in just two weeks after	0.7128569187323501
0	Zuma was elected president in 2009 and so with his nine years,	0.719720740508315
0	he's actually the longest-serving president in the country so far	0.7240612906599728
0	Now since the end of apartheid, South Africa has only elected ANC members and many have had scandals,	0.7270813722413974
0	but not quite like Zuma. Aside from the 2005 fraud charges, there were a bunch of other charges and allegations. In 2006,	0.7333568664365652
0	he was charged and eventually acquitted of raping a family friend. During his presidency, the state Ombudsman said that 20 million dollars in security upgrades	0.7417111180838825
0	to his home were excessive and obscene. There's also been	0.7501045915699195
0	controversy that his government was essentially paid to play. One of the prominent examples is the Gupta family. They're wealthy Indian immigrants. There,	0.7529416379039849
0	we saw emails link that implicated that the Guptas were actually using Zuma to help them get political appointees and better contracts for their businesses.	0.760733709862985
0	And actually just this, week police raided their residence, which actually led to concerns that there was more damning evidence	0.7686957431231043
0	that would be popping up soon against Zuma.	0.7748535718021128
0	But actually, one of the biggest things to happen came in October of 2017	0.7774029913188997
0	Because that's actually when the Supreme Court ruled that Zuma would need to face corruption charges because of a sketchy arms deal around two decades	0.7812990272983997
0	ago and from this to see many people in ANC just had enough with Zuma and in fact in November of 2017 they tried to	0.7886988808702019
0	vote him out of office though the president in South Africa is elected more like a prime minister. The parties vote for him into office	0.7954058152912875
0	not the people. Now, that said, Zuma ended up surviving that vote,	0.8019166405187742
0	but just barely. We then saw a rival faction in the ANC push forward Cyril Ramaphosa	0.8055250496809957
0	as the new head of the ANC. Cyril also has a long history with the party.	0.8104800753059304
0	He's actually seen as the real protege of Mandela by many.	0.8152128438447861
0	The ANC gave an ultimatum to Zuma: step down or we are going to vote you out of office and so Wednesday he announced his resignation	0.8187166614370882
0	in a speech saying, "No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name.	0.826757138374647
0	I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the Republic with immediate effect even though I disagree with the decision of	0.833411777010773
0	the leadership of my organization, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC. As I leave,	0.8399226022382595
0	I will continue to serve the people of South Africa as well as the ANC, the organisation	0.8454528814977513
0	I have served all my life." And after his resignation, the Parliament broke out into song and dance and seemingly the reaction wasn't just from	0.8504732768538856
0	his opposition.	0.8589059721786424
0	One analyst for the BBC in South Africa saying this: "The resignation of President Jacob Zuma	0.8600041836627967
0	marks the end of an era an era of one corruption allegation after another, an era of divisions, infighting, and public	0.8650638008576509
0	squabbles. There are many people who are	0.8717838092249764
0	celebrating now and not just from the opposition benches. Also, the question of well who will be president now	0.8736664574835268
0	Well if you've been paying attention it should come as no shock - Cyril Ramaphosa.	0.8798504340550152
0	He's already been sworn in and right now things are looking hopeful although South Africa of course has a long road ahead of it	0.8839033573893944
0	But just looking at the reaction in general,	0.891813094864554
0	it looks like people are	0.8939833699403829
0	celebrating this change and are very hopeful. And for those of you that thought that maybe DACA would be handled this week...	0.895709130844054
0	Nope! Yesterday, all four immigration bills that have been worked on failed. Chris Coons and John McCain's bill failed 52 to	0.9023637694801799
0	47. Toomey amendment failed 54 to 45. The Susan Collins Chuck Schumer common-sense plan failed fifty four to forty five and the Grassley bill that	0.9104957640414183

0	 The first thing you need to start with is one	0.09032002769946085
0	 land is a piece of land. A possible way to get that is to steal it. Of course this means you	0.09932235247563931
0	 have sufficient weapons to defend your own terrain. It could also become problematic when your	0.1098802987584706
0	 country enters the stage where it is judged by other nations, but this method	0.11942672008705545
0	 has worked before. An easier method is to claim unattended land. However, due to the attendance	0.1302097244892912

0	 136 nations recognize Palestine and in 2012 it was designated by the United Nations	0.3183682049760103

0	 from government, but since you are establishing this country in the 21st century, you will	0.6185883167631201
0	 Probably base the government on John Locke's government principles. Locke's principles	0.6287035663055844

0	 According to Locke, in a natural society - that is one without government, these rights	0.6699287728149577

0	 some of these rights, for example Freedom when you get in jail or Property when you pay taxes,	0.6932532027501608
0	 the government protects the same rights. Locke also says that the government only works	0.7052703170599001
0	 when there is a common belief in the abstract idea or illusion of a government and that is why	0.7198397388336548
0	 a government can only really exist when one is behind it. This is the reason that	0.7311643666221497
0	 autocratic or absolutist governments rarely work in a modern society. So, with these principles	0.7436785873274967
0	 in the back of your mind, you now need a constitution. Every recognized country in the world	0.7571598159964387
0	 has either a constitution or a similar document. This is not a complicated process,	0.7697952218430034

0	 This is where you examine all your work critically.	0.806450017312163
0	 Obtaining international recognition is by far the most difficult step in the process of creating	0.8158975119948558
0	 a country. It may take hundreds of years for new countries to be complete or almost	0.8268041747044567

0	Let's talk about the XFL.	0.3969169598880588
0	The former failed football	0.39822213278853313
0	The XFL, if you don't remember,	0.40092657028323464

0	If you ever	0.4041908999358127
0	I highly recommend ESPN's	0.40520075534203265
0	Long story short,	0.40816976750035633
0	there've been rumors	0.4096305177558479
0	it was going to happen,	0.4109440750646764
0	Vince McMahon announced	0.41185797557528686
0	And yesterday he did it in a	0.41479065529740894
0	a song that explained	0.4175882528849352
0	Saying that it's safer and	0.42007469576242684
0	what it's all about.	0.4227167159949358
0	Gaming, fantasy,	0.42386724314132107
0	make a bet,	0.4254835707518299
0	fewer penalties and that	0.4276597905202153
0	explaining the	0.4298350786876724
0	- We intend to start	0.43157624082256635
0	40-man rosters,	0.43483963887421617
0	postseason featuring two	0.43810396852679423
0	a championship game.	0.44136736657844405
0	- He also then makes	0.44220673901479474
0	in regards to the players.	0.444103478504706
0	- As you know, there is a wealth	0.44559497159082967
0	could draw from but in the XFL	0.4479575115448645
0	is going to be as important	0.4519671219400403
0	- Now of that matters	0.45476471952756653
0	Johnny Manziel, he, of course,	0.4568477792031272
0	for a little bit was the	0.4582461121964262
0	Long story short, he's	0.45980095414567074
0	He tweeted,	0.46185233938967096
0	Johnny was ready and	0.4655172574413953
0	this question and well, yeah.	0.46805214356715585
0	- [Man] Will any invites be	0.47024513215224967
0	Johnny Manziel, Tim Tebow,	0.47341443851014653
0	- Well, I think this, that one	0.47677285985647755
0	quality of the human being	0.48003532630719914
0	important as the quality player,	0.482616792479372
0	someone who does not have any	0.4857255447769328
0	with 'em and in the	0.4902941157290569
0	you will not play in the XFL.	0.49362086264382754
0	That would probably	0.49666719767919576
0	not all of them.	0.4994694532713632
0	If Tim Tebow wants to play,	0.500116915916495
0	- So no Johnny,	0.5038163032025645
0	Tebow could probably have it.	0.50577452835374
0	Also one of the points that	0.5066763180522833
0	it's in the rulebook to stand	0.5089764407441255
0	which it sounds	0.5116808782388271
0	it's going to be in	0.5134527832043532
0	if you're going to play in	0.5148511161976522
0	And I will say when	0.5164367009775288
0	I initially thought well this	0.5183641832980722
0	But if there was ever a time and	0.5205711458970897
0	away at a decent chunk of the	0.5227781084961073
0	competitor in their off-season,	0.5255757060836336
0	part of their strategy,	0.5277509942510906
0	You have differing groups angry	0.5298964711888439
0	many penalties,	0.5319785992634763
0	The NFL potentially has less and	0.5339992416768444
0	more parents are not letting	0.5367660964337385
0	because it seems too dangerous.	0.5388174816777388
0	CTE, of course, a big	0.5400602373160205
0	mind regarding the NFL.	0.5421814926296392
0	Also, based on the press	0.543262149706406
0	that Vince McMahon is treating	0.5450033118412999
0	where you're gonna have	0.5478940695216509
0	like in the past.	0.5502566094756857
0	Vince and the WWE have also	0.5509404045570191
0	many windows models.	0.5538004194067379
0	Just getting their content out	0.5550124322143875
0	it on any screen possible.	0.5570638174583877
0	So there is a chance here but	0.5586801450688965
0	they change the game.	0.5609495249301066
0	But that said to be 20% of	0.5618513146286499
0	anything sports, what	0.5640890200582996
0	You think it's gonna work?	0.5657053476688084
0	Do you think	0.5673989981563617
0	I'd love know	0.5687824255348088
0	Then, let's just knock out	0.5700261127740188
0	yesterday but is also a story	0.5718287605701771
0	Will Oprah and should Oprah	0.5746263581577032
0	A lot of people asked me why	0.5782009109193876
0	gave that speech at	0.5805634508734224
0	And my answer to that is because	0.5829884080896498
0	For the most part, a lot of	0.585909908600633
0	prospect of an Oprah presidency	0.5878066480905442
0	"Ugh, Donald Trump is	0.5906349885087026
0	"Why do we have a	0.5940232210847375
0	But then when Oprah or	0.5952669083239475
0	they're like "For president!"	0.5980328314799133
0	And you know who	0.5991600686030923
0	Opera shouldn't run	0.6008928463296321
0	In an interview she just did	0.6031184409472146
0	"I've always felt very secure in	0.605773503592719

0	"help me with a campaign.	0.6137927243830705
0	Just kinda think of how bat	0.6155338865179645

0	participants, fewer entrants,	0.6210359216001923
0	singing competition on	0.6241437422968248

0	They can kill legislation,	0.6298013547340698
0	make far-reaching	0.6310441103723515
0	and the things that not only	0.6336246449435963
0	however many Americans but	0.636733397241157
0	the 7.6 billion people,	0.6389086854086141
0	Winner of a popularity contest	0.6421730150611922
0	for 60 days without the	0.6458099850850691
0	I mean just think	0.6478613703290694
0	I don't think	0.6493537950161213
0	qualified to be President.	0.6506282250859635
0	It just makes me think it's	0.6516846605385958
0	are still alive right now.	0.6540164576619985
0	And then let's talk about this	0.6550728931146307
0	the US military and pedophiles.	0.6578397478715248
0	This week report came	0.6597048129298756
0	widespread child abuse and	0.6619425183595253
0	And if some of	0.6648025332092441
0	that might be because this	0.6661393805412787
0	2015 article from	0.6679727711680692
0	where they wrote	0.6698695106579804
0	It sparked tons of outrage	0.6712995180828398
0	it detailed the	0.6734440634196648
0	Now the question that some of	0.6752159683851909
0	what is bacha bazi?	0.6770810334435418
0	Well, bacha bazi is this	0.678137468896174
0	for hundreds of	0.6797854709382433
0	in Central Asian countries.	0.6813701241171917
0	It's really only practiced	0.6824899084329448
0	tribal regions of Pakistan.	0.6846344537697697
0	The practice is	0.6858772094080514
0	within Afghan society.	0.687432051357296
0	It is widespread,	0.6885201612414886
0	Men aren't even afraid	0.6902920662070148
0	Bacha means boy, bazi means play	0.6921571312653656
0	these boys that are used as	0.6960735815677167
0	Afghan men instead of women.	0.6982181269045417
0	Starting at around	0.6993686540509269
0	the bacha bazi, are picked	0.7012337191092777
0	They prey on	0.704031316696804
0	security, they promise	0.7052740723350857
0	their food, their housing.	0.7072015546556291
0	They say that when you're no	0.7085691448182959
0	we'll pay for your wedding.	0.710702510943982
0	These weddings can cost	0.7127026581369286
0	country like Afghanistan.	0.7146618148890324
0	And these boys do this	0.7156250902488399
0	pretty much when	0.7187645853770329
0	And as far as	0.7202570100640848
0	we see instances of boys	0.7215006973032948
0	Others being forced into it,	0.7241734603664359
0	We talk about 12 and	0.7265667431511029
0	there's no consent there.	0.7289292831051377
0	These boys are	0.730359290529997
0	They're used to sexual	0.7317892979548565
0	It's also believed that this	0.7338723576304171
0	society due to	0.7356750054265754
0	I mean for many centuries	0.737474858419949
0	separated in Afghan society.	0.7390483323877584
0	To this day,	0.7404932454274697
0	largely segregated at all times.	0.7419512008801765
0	So much so that women	0.743784591506967
0	in Afghan society.	0.7452798109968036
0	Now that said, the practice did	0.7464573545701081
0	penalty of death but it was	0.7487304608350311
0	because the Taliban	0.7498558347563538
0	It was less about	0.7519323732254167
0	"We'll kill you if you're gay."	0.7537657638522071
0	The law was strongly enforced	0.754956349838507
0	and the practice needed	0.7561255090034572
0	But then came US forces and	0.7579132511847635
0	the practice came	0.7594857935516447
0	It was still illegal but the	0.7610704467305931
0	And often if it was a powerful	0.7635885640396453
0	the crime, it was	0.7657619890052458
0	But where does the US military	0.767443528680732
0	Well for years, US soldiers in	0.7697660097948522
0	on widespread child	0.7718285742499914
0	Many reports of American troops	0.7741259021390489
0	having problems	0.7751087411183496
0	commanders over bacha bazi.	0.776644019448101
0	After the invasion by the US,	0.7777349241350784
0	the practice started up again.	0.7803834655740851
0	US soldiers began getting into	0.7815116342981924
0	that they were	0.7836347528136677
0	One example you might	0.7852082267814772
0	An Afghan commander and	0.7873956257610015
0	bacha bazi chained to	0.7898448046013633
0	And in response to	0.7919381118871347
0	a man I would	0.7938031769454855
0	beat the shit out of	0.7950459325837672
0	was reprimanded over it.	0.7967032506351189

0	understandable that you gave	0.47163313685289593
0	this student two days	0.4730715017939518
0	that you punished this person	0.47550081154963264

0	"it was on school property."	0.47993763881770035
0	Maybe you should do a	0.4823220997778917
0	a lot more listening.	0.48403169314881256
0	I think maybe that would be a	0.4849938065949086
0	who is helping and	0.48788014693319665
0	Or not, it's the	0.4905166154109004
0	Then, in a quickie	0.4926896463352127
0	I like to call "Is It Weird?"	0.49415043567401334
0	Let's talk about	0.4976422347514095
0	The reason for that is this	0.5000501879378096
0	March 2018 dual cover featuring	0.502346019135486
0	And more specifically,	0.5057299675380147
0	was a photo of	0.5076093456347173
0	with their&nbsp;legs wrapped	0.5095453186400136
0	That photo got	0.5112175380146933
0	Some people loved it,	0.5123045873910815
0	others thought it was	0.5147093370920895
0	And so I pass the	0.5176309157696908
0	is it weird?	0.5190564667691782
0	As far as my opinion,	0.5198402528617803
0	bothered more by the amount	0.5223699384930804
0	and two, I don't	0.5259108576798223
0	Like my experience with	0.5281063130018794
0	are my two little boys.	0.5327022467110883
0	Right, so I'm like okay,	0.5341982743892021
0	they're gonna be	0.5359804800956774
0	You know, one's gonna be four,	0.5379047069878695
0	Also, what is up with that pose?	0.5397926277122843
0	What is supposed	0.5415737655902956
0	We got a hand on a foot,	0.5432128822825901
0	It kinda just looks like they're	0.5454222193746796
0	I'll pass the	0.5475600119596788
0	I'm done with this story.	0.5489855629591662
0	The more we stay on	0.5496967367162139
0	And then let's talk	0.5518355971296771
0	legal news out of California.	0.5536882795147787
0	And this all revolves	0.5552558516999829
0	Prop 64 is the voter approved	0.5576072099777891
0	January that legalized	0.5602436784554929
0	anyone 21 years or	0.5628342303092432

0	marijuana convictions to	0.5695797027165556

0	San Francisco District Attorney	0.5791282248419614

0	Also another 4,940 felony	0.5928071074662566
0	will be reviewed,	0.5958055697932684
0	That said, there are	0.5976689304630104
0	Individuals who	0.5999006919528447
0	have committed a violent felony,	0.6017170681701691

0	to petition the court,	0.6120856825559542
0	it just happens.	0.6140451477874594
0	And as far as why the	0.6149357167264651

0	"While drug policy on	0.6189123099265335

0	this part of Prop 64.	0.6536306167777208
0	According to the	0.6552686656415514
0	only 4,885 people across the	0.6572291987015206
0	the court to have	0.6611118229967538
0	This despite the	0.6628577225354519
0	we've seen in California.	0.6649602767811379
0	I mean just	0.6660793610114472
0	there were nearly	0.6686656415513412
0	related arrests in California.	0.6710169998291474
0	So there you go, now you know.	0.6725493336750384
0	Maybe you can do	0.6736897744746284
0	not only do I hope the rest	0.6759695882453443
0	right, just handle	0.6795681701691441
0	so they can live their lives.	0.6817775072612335
0	But hopefully more states	0.6827748590466427
0	because it is insane to	0.6848058687852383
0	nonviolent drug	0.6869436613702374
0	something with marijuana,	0.6887963437553392
0	and it can ruin	0.6902614044079959
0	But that's where	0.6923244490005126
0	Then we had a quick update on	0.6931231846916112
0	That, of course, the horrifying	0.696065052110029
0	Morgan Geyser stabbing another	0.6990229369554075
0	That girl managed to survive,	0.703333760464719
0	they were charged.	0.7061485562959167
0	The reason it's called the	0.7068971040492056
0	two girls said they did this	0.7088202631129336
0	so they could be in his favor.	0.7119917136511191
0	They could live in his mansion.	0.7131673927900222
0	The last update we had	0.7144861609431061
0	to 25 years in	0.7168022808815991
0	And the new update today is that	0.7188685289595079
0	to 40 years in	0.7216833247907056
0	That said, will she	0.7239311037075005
0	With how severe they described	0.7261372373141979
0	But according	0.7298426020844012
0	"She can petition to	0.7314454126089185
0	"and I presume we'll do that."	0.7336547497010081
0	This is where we	0.7349372116863148
0	And then let's talk about	0.7363980010251153
0	Baltimore Police Department.	0.7387856654706988
0	An elite gun trace task	0.740353237655903
0	indicted in 2017 and is	0.7429181616265164
0	And over the	0.7456977191184008
0	details have emerged exposing	0.7469203827097215
0	over four years of	0.7485125149495985
0	This task force was supposed	0.7512130531351444
0	something Baltimore has	0.7538569964120964
0	But instead this group	0.7563151375363062
0	arresting without warrants,	0.7589879121817871
0	abusing overtime, selling drugs	0.7617664018452076
0	getting them back	0.765867930975568
0	But they were finally caught	0.7677174098752776
0	internal affairs and the use	0.7701392448317103
0	And so these	0.7726699982914744
0	And all of them pled guilty	0.7742375704766786
0	except for Daniel Hersl	0.775448487954895
0	And over the past week,	0.7778361524004784
0	detailing years of abuses,	0.7800102511532547
0	Things like nearly every	0.783144327695199
0	doubled because	0.7850333162480779
0	So instead of the	0.7868496924654024
0	they'd essentially double it.	0.7893793780967026
0	They've stolen hundreds	0.790413036049889
0	over the years.	0.7921941739279003
0	They're also facing	0.792907483341876
0	and face decades in prison.	0.7944398171877669
0	Also some of the	0.7958643003587904
0	that have come out are crazy.	0.797503417051085
0	Reportedly the task force	0.7990357508969759
0	drive fast at groups of people,	0.8013443960362208
0	see who ran and whoever ran	0.8045820519391765
0	they would just chase down	0.8059253801469332
0	And according to testimony this	0.8084529301213054
0	slow night and	0.8111502648214591
0	There's another story	0.8132165128993678
0	arrested a man by the	0.8151407397915599
0	They took his house keys.	0.8172069878694687
0	They then got his address	0.8181936613702375
0	went to the house	0.8206528703229113
0	broke in, found	0.8230149068853579
0	They crack open the safe that	0.8255445925166581
0	reportedly has	0.8272146762344097
0	They end up taking $100,000, and	0.8295062361182299
0	some expensive watches as well.	0.8332756705962754
0	They then seal it back up	0.8345656073808303
0	themselves opening	0.8379079104732616
0	There's footage of	0.8397958311976764
0	"Nobody touch anything."	0.8415780369041517
0	Then after that incident they	0.842575388689561
0	with his wife while in jail,	0.8459785580044422
0	legal defense, and the police	0.8489535281052452
0	picture so they went to his	0.85084144882966
0	door claiming to be another	0.8532291132752434
0	Detective Ward, who pled guilty,	0.8559723645993508
0	source in internal affairs	0.8587508542627712
0	he was being investigated.	0.8606750811549633
0	Officer Rayam testified they	0.8617909618998804
0	half of marijuana and a gun	0.8645555697932684
0	Jenkins told them	0.8673020246027678
0	so they sold it	0.868870664616436
0	Rayam admitted to stealing	0.8706165641551341
0	He also recounted that in	0.873680164018452
0	It was widely believed to be an	0.8765301981889629
0	it was actually	0.8793813001879378
0	heavily involved	0.8808773278660516
0	There was a bail	0.8824449000512558
0	with Sergeant Jenkins	0.8841192550828635
0	Reportedly Jenkins would bring	0.8861502648214591
0	So much so that the bondsman	0.8890366051597471
0	$1 million selling	0.8917093798052281
0	between $250,000-	0.8939176490688536
0	Also when stopping	0.896875533914232
0	Jenkins would pretend to be a	0.8987634546386468
0	drugs and weapons but then he'd	0.9016497949769349
0	weren't his target and then	0.9040438663933026
0	They would also, I know	0.9067091662395352
0	but it just has to be told.	0.9092068170169144
0	They would also reportedly take	0.911269861609431
0	their vehicles	0.9141914402870323
0	Now there,	0.9157590124722365
0	it's unclear whether they	0.9169709977789168
0	the officers when arrested	0.9193575943960363
0	did have fake guns	0.9207116008884333
0	And they're not even done yet.	0.9226358277806254
0	Holy hell, I mean with the	0.9244532718264138
0	of Baltimore, I mean	0.926893259866735
0	for not feeling safe.	0.9298329916282249
0	And the last thing I want to do	0.9312222364599351
0	all Baltimore PD as these guys.	0.9342869041517171
0	When you see this is able to	0.9370653938151375
0	untested, I mean how can those	0.9408423030924312
0	people really be	0.9420713736545361
0	And the overtime situation is	0.9439774474628395
0	actually bigger	0.9450794464377242
0	Right now Baltimore PD spends	0.9472919870152059
0	about $1 million per	0.9487880146933196
0	It's gotten so bad that there	0.9515568939005639
0	planning on making their	0.9545959337092089
0	at the beginning and	0.9576242952332137
0	prove they actually did it.	0.9596905433111225
0	With that said, I want to pass	0.9609025286178028
0	really is just an	0.9632464120963609
0	when you see this story,	0.9661402272338971
0	what does this make you feel?	0.9691685887579019
0	Do you think that it's the bad	0.9705578335896121
0	there's a lot more corruption	0.9745835468990262
0	than a lot of people	0.9761521869126943
0	I'd love to know	0.9776834529301213

0	looks pretty darn impressive the first	0.08222082080139712
0	thing we noticed about it is that it is	0.09139419811778403
0	way smaller they actually removed 24% of	0.09997574463956535
0	the overall volume and they did all of	0.12355680605413796
0	that while making some pretty impressive	0.13549044338798874
0	upgrades so the bezels are even thinner	0.14683710099932085
0	it weighs even less at only about 1.2	0.1625594256330649
0	kilograms and it packs eighty percent	0.17842243135732996

0	be able to turbo this bad boy up higher	0.2462404191326283
0	and for a longer and they're able to do	0.2589017172795188

0	they've added their insulation to the	0.31594547394974287

0	that heat from being passed to the user	0.33253614048704766

0	Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it	0.003056185925579592
0	And the first thing we're gonna talk about today is the Super Bowl - kind of.	0.007207125018530978
0	Last night the New England Patriots played the Philadelphia Eagles - the Eagles won (!)	0.011449293542096681
0	It was huge. It was their first Super Bowl win ever and in response to this big win	0.015463388489126591
0	a good amount of people just went batshit crazy in Philadelphia	0.021165227902521355
0	you had around 100,000 people in the streets, there were just these pockets of craziness and destruction	0.025133708134244107
0	myself and around 10,000 other people were listening to a live police scanner in Philadelphia	0.03147415356193908
0	"We have a large, secondary crowd at clamoring at right in front of St Vincent's; chanting free Meek Mills and throwing bottles and cans"	0.03671984582226226
0	and the videos coming out of this thing!	0.046732275832183465
0	[you've got] people flipping cars, fires being set in the middle of the street, people tearing down light poles	0.04924108517407716
0	Then crowds carrying around parts of the light poles... Some people looting, destroying property	0.05492011722981834
0	these geniuses on top of this f*cking awning	0.06110091115393826
0	There's come people jumping then the thing just collapsed.	0.06381498671471417
0	There's a video of a guy eating a horse shit and people cheering him on (wut)	0.06703082414386881
0	I mean what we were seeing in a good number of places was - it was a riot	0.07232213111949914
0	But I also want to point out and give props to the people that weren't being a part of this	0.0755379685486538
0	and Adam Ferrone of Barstool Sports filmed a lot of it.	0.08050997251713403
0	you've got people chasing away looters, and some fans pleading that we're better than this	0.08356615844271362
0	So that said, I'll say congratulations to the Eagles; good job to those trying to defend their city	0.09081889817655175
0	And to the people destroying their own city because their f*cking team won	0.0968628479547502
0	you're a f*cking idiot - a fantastic job looking like the asshole you are	0.10051202517932285
0	Then we have some YouTube news; some awesome some interesting/concerning	0.10406997297328117
0	To start off with the awesome	0.10865425186165056
0	I want to talk about KSI and Joe Weller.  If you do not know they are massive creators on the platform	0.1102507668974011
0	On Saturday they had a livestream boxing match. They've been hyping it up for months	0.11561049594599218
0	I don't care about any of the drama stuff - whether it's fake or real	0.12040004105324377
0	Or any of the build-up. What I care about is that when they live streamed it at the height of it	0.12347903433647694
0	They had 1.6 million concurrent viewers	0.12945456204171465
0	This split between the two main live streams on their channels, the VOD the video on demand of those live streams	0.13198617874126192
0	after the fact as of recording this video 20.8 million views and those are just purely	0.13914768904448574
0	Insane and amazing numbers and regardless of who won - KSI did win the fight	0.1440968856553124
0	This is a big moment. It's a big moment for they're legitimizing what is happening online, the people that are behind it - Massive.	0.1497531103534
0	So congrats and props to both those guys.	0.1565953176494737
0	and the other bit of YouTube news actually has to do with news itself	0.15855675040768152
0	YouTube announcing that if a news publisher is funded in part or in whole by a government	0.16165855104856827
0	They will now put a disclaimer underneath that video and so there are people that are happy	0.1665393255864342
0	But also people that are very concerned. A lot of people view news that is funded by a government to just be a propaganda machine	0.17048499846050336
0	Russia Today (RT) has blown up on YouTube, they have 2.2 billion views	0.17646052616574107
0	For transparency's sake that now gets a disclaimer	0.18172902578371783
0	AJ+ (al-jazeera plus) that will now get a disclaimer since they completely funded by Qatar	0.1842378351256115
0	So there are a lot of people cheering this move saying that it helps transparency	0.18911860966347743
0	It helps show people that maybe they should also look at other sources if they're watching this video	0.19269936481508934
0	you've also got people concerned because it's taking something like Russia today	0.1974204878493802
0	and putting it essentially in the same category as a PBS or a CBC and understandably PBS has some concerns with that	0.20136616072344937
0	A spokesperson of theirs, saying...	0.20848205631136604
0	Now on that point I will say if there is a difference in the disclaimers.	0.2294420179950052
0	Russia today gets the disclaimer: "RT is funded in whole or in part by the Russian government"	0.23295435107365636
0	Whereas PBS gets the disclaimer "publicly funded American broadcaster"	0.23740178581610427
0	Which PBS's concern is still too vague. Their concerns seem to be YouTube's creating a situation where now they have to educate	0.24156412858788245
0	The viewer on something that's underneath all of their videos	0.24776772986965595
0	But with all of that said I do want to pass a question off to you	0.25083531947406235
0	Do you like this move; do you think that it helps transparency; it doesn't matter	0.25357220239249184
0	I'd love to know your thoughts. From that, I want to share some stuff I love today	0.2583263960953804
0	And today in awesome: the main bits of awesome today, we have our trailers, trailers on trailers	0.26217057622789114
0	We got Jurassic world: Fallen Kingdom.	0.2677355714953644
0	Mission Impossible.	0.2700391146183759
0	Fallout, Avengers: Infinity war. West world solo, A Star Wars story and then one of the trailers	0.27149878550820494
0	I got the most excited for was the Cloverfield paradigm. The new Cloverfield movie	0.2781699376218768
0	Not only because it was a trailer, but because they released it that night after the game on Netflix!	0.28278842754672656
0	I will say as a huge fan of Cloverfield; I was also a big fan of 10 Cloverfield Lane	0.28833061545654626
0	It's-it's the Paradox... (ugh)	0.2931885826367586
0	Paradox is the worst of the three. now keep in mind if you are a fan of the franchise, just go in with extremely low expectations	0.296039502343456
0	You'll be fine, you'll be good, it ends with some questions, but at the same time a lot of just random stuff	0.3028817096395297
0	That is kind of unexplained happens	0.3087089895200192
0	That said I am at a point where I am worried about the franchise, the closest thing I can connect it to is if you were like a big fan of	0.31093270689124314
0	Paranormal activity right, I was a big fan of the first three movies in each one, there was something kind of unique and then it	0.3169082345964808
0	Kind of felt like there was it sh*t-show cash-grab	0.3232486800241758
0	And that's what I'm worried about, I even feel like I don't want to admit to myself how much I didn't like Paradox	0.3255750305048409
0	just because I am actually a fan of the franchise, and I want the next one to be better (struggles man I getchu)	0.3322803936549931
0	But that said I'm still putting this in TIA because the marketing around	0.3372067829081662
0	Showing a trailer and releasing it the same night. That's awesome.	0.3417454470812284
0	Although once again the cynic in my head is like yeah, it's awesome	0.3461358634295424
0	Or maybe it was their way to get around critics bashing an inferior movie.	0.3485990580561289
0	And if you want to see the full versions everything I just shared; the secret links of the day, anything at all -	0.35311491487153757
0	Links as always are in the description down below. And then let's talk about the Nunes memo	0.35733427603744966
0	We talked about the potential release of this memo last week, after I had already finished filming the Friday show, it was then released	0.3612229305173849
0	If you don't remember this revolves around Devin Nunes, the head of the House Intelligence Committee	0.3677686421639621
0	And it was claimed that this memo that he wrote detailed abuses in the use of the Foreign Intelligence	0.37175992975333844
0	Surveillance Act court process. Specifically taking aim at the FBI and the DOJ	0.37618455713813276
0	Regarding a FISA warrant they wanted for Carter Page. And the reason Carter Page matters is he's a former Trump campaign adviser	0.3812021758219202
0	And it was also suspected that he was working with the Russians. And so then of course as we talked about there are a lot of	0.3873943734248669
0	people saying release the memo we need this transparency, others saying no, that it's misleading	0.39187601920379517
0	it could potentially be harmful, the House Intelligence Committee has the numbers so they vote to release it, the White House, President Trump approve and	0.3976006659748435
0	They released it on Friday. I'll link to the full document down below	0.4054235896500211
0	But there are two very different	0.4082631056778917
0	reactions we see from this. We see Trump tweets "This memo totally vindicates "Trump" in probe. But the  Russian witch-hunt goes on and on	0.4102929605090602
0	There was no collusion and there was no obstruction ( the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing,	0.41712376412630714
0	Collusion is dead. This is an American disgrace	0.4228370072185287
0	Also tweeting:"The top leadership and investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred	0.42540283495455633
0	investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans; something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.	0.4309906375796832
0	Rank and file are great people. What's being touted as a big bombshell moment	0.43701178000022806
0	In this memo by many people who support Donald Trump is around McCabe. The memo claims that then Deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe told	0.4403416542176506
0	The House Intelligence Committee that no FISA warrant would have been issued relating to one time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page without the Steele dossier	0.4481873852504818
0	That dossier put together by Christopher Steele, a former British spy secretly funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign	0.455816446385604
0	Also noting that it wasn't explained who funded this venture.  But what the other side is saying is that we just have Nunes' word here.	0.4632516449806708
0	The actual FISA Court warrant is still classified and there are sources that said McCabe didn't say that	0.4704929810356821
0	Additionally saying the McCabe did disclose where the funding came from.	0.4767193896751092
0	So that creates a little bit of a he-said she-said situation, and we don't have the actual exact	0.4772895736164487
0	information because that is still classified. that brings us to what the FBI said before this release, that they have "grave concerns about material omissions of	0.48439406552553854
0	fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy" and after looking at the document that seems to be that it places too much	0.49201172298183393
0	Importance on the steel dossier. Also an important thing to note there is that the director of the FBI is not some	0.4990021781026559
0	foreign person trying to attack Donald Trump. The director of the FBI, the head of the FBI is	0.5053312198515241
0	Christopher Wray, a man that Donald Trump appointed. If the memo mentioning Trump adviser George Papadopoulos	0.5105997194695009
0	His mention's important because he's not mentioned in the steel dossier	0.5153208425037917
0	And he relates to this entire situation. Popped up on the FBI's radar	0.5194147632026092
0	Because reportedly he told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton emails	0.522676215347071
0	He's now pled guilty to lying to the FBI, and he was working with Special Counsel.	0.5279321709183382
0	The memo also stating that Steele was desperate for Donald Trump not to be elected president	0.5319816172697313
0	They also found out there is more information about Carter Page outside of this memo.  Outside of this memo we found out that Carter page	0.5368281807711167
0	back in 2013 claimed that he was an informal adviser to the Kremlin (Moscow). Also on the note of Donald Trump saying that this totally vindicates him	0.5424045797174168
0	Three Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that voted for the memo to be released - they have pushed back against the president's claims	0.5504555769691303
0	Republican Trey Gowdy saying "the document has no effect on potential links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin." Also saying "he has complete confidence in	0.5566819856085573
0	FBI director Wray, Deputy attorney general Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller adding	0.5638891106270884
0	"There is a Russia investigation without a dossier" Republican Chris Stewart saying "I think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the Special Counsel	0.568781288843781
0	Shouldn't complete his work. I support his work. I want him to finish it. I hope he finishes it	0.5758743770740441
0	as quickly as possible, the essence of this memo is something quite different"	0.579728820517499
0	Republican Will Hurd saying "I would say that the DOJ and the FBI should continue doing their job	0.5836060713186074
0	I don't believe this is an attack on Bob Mueller	0.5883488613426692
0	I don't believe this is an attack on the men and women in the FBI	0.5905737190817758
0	I've served shoulder-to-shoulder with them, and they are hardworking folks that keep us safe"	0.5929684916354016
0	We're also now seeing the minority in the House Intelligence Committee, the Democrats wanting to put out their own memo. Main argument from the Democrats	0.596629072538801
0	Is that there are missions that mislead the public there's more information to be shared	0.6030949584335906
0	The House Intelligence Committee is set to vote on whether to make that document public or not then that of course has to go to	0.6080544183553614
0	The president when it gets there we don't know what the president will do. Personally	0.6138702945570241
0	I will say now this bag has been opened with the Nunez memo. I think it is incredibly important	0.6173598202780217
0	we see what the other side has to say I mean if we're just playing the the public perception game that would look like	0.6230730633702433
0	The President is trying to hide something.	0.6291968389002293
0	Also on that note President Trump has Adam Schiff in his crosshairs. Schiff is a Democrat on the House Intelligence	0.630941601760728
0	Committee that wrote the rebuttal memo and Donald Trump tweeted "little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the	0.6361188719480905
0	biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee	0.6428812534923767
0	Hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped." And so that's where we are as of right now. Now this situation	0.6488693252443238
0	changes later today. We don't know what's going to happen with a vote in the House Intelligence Committee although	0.6548448529495615
0	There are some signs pointing to things looking good for an approval. And even if it is approved it then goes to Trump's desk	0.659713083440718
0	What happens there, we don't know what Trump will do.  I will say personally	0.6665906421411547
0	I am of the mindset of I would love to see more information so I could see both arguments	0.6693263846917016
0	That said I will say I am somewhat skeptical	0.6748343615650408
0	While I have no doubt that people in the FBI the	0.6783238872860384
0	the DOJ have their personal preferences their personal biases	0.6809364701052559
0	when I look back to what was happening to say that the FBI was weaponized to go against Donald Trump	0.6844944178992143
0	It feels like you have to willfully forget that the FBI is also the reason, but most likely a big part of the reason why Hillary Clinton lost the election	0.6897173028018839
0	You might not remember but the FBI was incredibly vocal about everything Hillary Clinton	0.6995472739505765
0	Especially the second time which turned out to be like 'oh actually these are all the same emails, never mind' even though people are doing	0.7049526177144747
0	Early voting and so that's why for me personally it feels weird especially with	0.7117149992587609
0	Republicans who voted for the release saying it doesn't show what a lot of people are saying it shows. I just want more information	0.7154542655460652
0	But I will pass a question off to you. What are your thoughts around all of this?	0.7210534718500188
0	I'll link to the full Nunez memo down below. What I'm trying to do here is to simplify it for the for the sake of time	0.724508786534536
0	and getting the message across. What was your takeaway; was this huge, was that it a dud?	0.7305424730017904
0	Do you want to see more information come out or no they're going to mislead any and all thoughts	0.7346808680480323
0	I want to know what you're thinking in those comments down below. Then over the weekend	0.7405879736803093
0	We saw Uma Thurman speak out against both Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino. On Weinstein	0.7437707404408662
0	She says she met him after pulp fiction came out saying "I knew him pretty well before he attacked me	0.749653898347607
0	He used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me	0.754239317603859
0	Possibly he made me overlook warning signs, this was my champion	0.7592797436452999
0	I was never any kind of studio Darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me	0.762472773716801
0	She then describes a night in Paris where she says the two were arguing over a script	0.7677754843712582
0	He then changes the subject leads her to a sauna. He's in a bathrobe	0.7719492308218632
0	She says she didn't feel threatened, but she did say "This is ridiculous, what are you doing?"	0.7756782337982233
0	Saying she left, but then said not long after that she was in a hotel in London when he attacked her. Thurman saying "it was such a bat	0.7792361815921817
0	to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself	0.785017846757364
0	He did all kinds of unpleasant things	0.7894310704633315
0	But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard	0.7913810995427125
0	I was doing anything I could to get the train back on track.My track. Not his track."	0.7959311673946015
0	She then says at a later time when she confronted him about this	0.800241757991128
0	He gave a half-assed apology. Now in response to these claims a Weinstein spokesperson said	0.8031839071284397
0	Mr. Weinstein acknowledge is making an awkward past 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals after a	0.8091708385125042
0	flirtatious exchange in Paris,	0.8149981183929936
0	Which he immediately apologized and deeply regret. However her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue and this is the first time we have heard	0.8165604223922638
0	those details. This is the first time we are hearing that she considered	0.8237447400531411
0	Mr. Weinstein an enemy and the pictures of their history tell a completely different story	0.8271088253070441
0	So there is that part of the story and response and then there was what happened on the set of Kill Bill. During the scene	0.8308264246045775
0	Where she's driving the convertible to kill bill she found out that she was being asked to drive the car herself	0.8365054566603186
0	She said she was told by one of the Teamsters that the car might not be working that well	0.8419108004242168
0	And she didn't feel comfortable driving it and she says at that point "Quentin came in my trailer and didn't like to hear no like	0.845366115108734
0	any director. He was furious because I'd cost them a lot of time, but I was scared"	0.8510451471644752
0	He said "I promise you the car is fine. It's straight piece of Road." She says Quentin convinces her to do it	0.8552531046515606
0	It's going to be simple enough	0.8601794939047337
0	And then he says "hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won't blow the right way	0.8612514397144518
0	and I'll make you do it again." and she says, but that was a death box I was in.	0.8655848376686319
0	The seat wasn't screwed down properly	0.8686296199153847
0	It was a sand road, and it was not a straight road." Also all these years later	0.8709901814325302
0	We now have footage of the car crash	0.8750270837372136
0	She is driving down a straight part of the road	0.8780034439110057
0	But then it turns to the right and you immediately see her start to lose control	0.8804324275011118
0	And then BOOM. Describing the incident Thurman said "the steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me.	0.8852561836448438
0	I felt the seething pain, and thought Oh My God	0.8920641799044372
0	I'm never going to walk again, and as far as how Uma got this footage	0.8945273745310237
0	She said she fought for 15 years.	0.8981879554344231
0	Initially she said when she tried to obtain it Miramax said we'll give it to you	0.9004458838421274
0	But you'll have to sign a contract that releases us from quote "any	0.9036275102348017
0	consequences of my future pain and suffering" She fought for a really long time and then after 15 years,	0.9068205403063028
0	Quentin Tarantino just gave her the footage	0.9119521957783581
0	But she said that wasn't the only horrible moment. For a scene in the movie where Uma Thurman gets spit on, reportedly that was Quentin Tarantino	0.9141873168284088
0	Also in one of the scenes where she's being choked with a chain reportedly that was Tarantino	0.9205505696137574
0	and while it does appear that she has issue with Tarantino	0.9246433499446921
0	She posted something today that makes it seem like it's a lot more than that. Tarantino writing	0.9284293713151863
0	"He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm	0.9335268157507612
0	And I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage. Quentin Tarantino was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about	0.9364689648880729
0	This sorry event adding the cover up after the fact is unforgivable. For this. I hold Lawrence Bender	0.9429006397463822
0	E. Bennett Walsh and the notorious Harvey Weinstein's solely responsible. They lied, destroyed evidence and continued to lie about the permanent harm	0.9485466011335256
0	they caused and then chose to suppress. The cover-up did have malicious intent and shame on these three for all eternity	0.9561072401956872
0	CAA never sent anyone to Mexico	0.9622412790366172
0	I hope they look after other clients more respectfully if they in fact want to do the job for which they take money with any decency	0.9648652655346615
0	and as of recording this video Tarantino has not made a comment. But I do want to pass the question off to you	0.9710460594587814
0	"What are your thoughts on this situation?"	0.9762906113512219

0	really cool automatically based features	0.1776739630034284
0	like the one we used here which was able	0.18490374109934823

0	life improvements just kind of keep on	0.21564630976151905
0	going it has a camera built into it so	0.2222054779037788
0	that you can actually see what the laser	0.22989112006932147
0	engravers see so when you need to set	0.23814188298233055
0	your object inside you don't have to do	0.24458425950344723
0	it with a whole bunch of different	0.25170478092152354
0	measurements and stuff you can just line	0.25475266548619224
0	it up with a camera and you're good to	0.25984251968503935
0	go it also is able to auto focus the	0.26583279960818296
0	camera along a curve so if you're doing	0.2746486832686584
0	something like engraving the top of a	0.28199525298572126
0	Macbook it can see the edges and engrave	0.29035904004822366
0	along the edges autofocusing the laser	0.3008702859510982
0	so you don't have any mistakes on the	0.3078777832196813
0	side and you don't have to do anything	0.3139810872923181
0	way too fancy they use mirrors to	0.3185020532720491
0	redirect the laser this can sometimes be	0.3264137437365784
0	an issue because if the mirror is	0.33229099951022867
0	misaligned	0.33715103793843954
0	it can cause various problems we would	0.3400896658252647
0	prefer that they use something like	0.3482274045887805
0	fiber optics but they put the mirrors	0.35320046716648457
0	into solid aluminum blocks and once a	0.3633726406208793
0	bolt is in place those things aren't	0.37195870851071844
0	moving so it should probably be fine the	0.37727461100855214
0	delicate components in the head are also	0.3842821082771352
0	completely sealed off which is great	0.39095053309723843
0	because that means less maintenance for	0.3976189579173417
0	you as it won't be able to get gummed up	0.4056436725313642
0	but if you do need to access it you can	0.411630184982858
0	just simply remove it with a few magnets	0.419545642919037
0	there's three stepper motors to move	0.4253098745431941
0	everything around you've got one on each	0.43243039596127036
0	side to control the y-axis and then one	0.4387597483328938
0	in the back to control the x-axis the	0.4475718645217195
0	laser moves along with the head in terms	0.4562784915043514
0	of the y-axis to keep everything aligned	0.4654334476133067
0	thing that you might notice is that it's	0.47696191086162076
0	not the biggest unit ever but that	0.48204799758881817
0	doesn't completely limit you in terms of	0.4879177184191689
0	y-axis printing you can actually print	0.4962890404249708
0	things that go pretty far because it has	0.5037448668198772
0	a pass-through slot so you can feed	0.514485928493388
0	things through the laser engraver while	0.5217194740609576
0	it's going so it doesn't completely work	0.5298572128244735
0	right now but theoretically what will	0.5405907395546848
0	happen is you'll put part of it in it'll	0.5479410767433975
0	laser engrave what it needs to it'll cut	0.5574313378291829
0	what it needs to and then when it's	0.5657988923633349
0	ready you can feed more of it in and	0.5713370756885054
0	they'll just do the next part and so on	0.5800361677278378
0	and so forth until you're done but said	0.5863692875711111
0	pass-through slot does come at an	0.5940549297366537
0	additional expense if you do want the	0.6016275477527031
0	basic version that's four thousand	0.6099913348152055
0	dollars it comes with a 40 watt laser	0.618016049429228
0	and that's about it no pass-through slot	0.6238933052028783
0	no built-in venting if you do want to	0.6341785028067664
0	vent it out you can send it out through	0.6449157970086276
0	a window or you can just do it outside	0.6502279320348114

0	has that $1,000 vent built-in it has the	0.687748182194929
0	pass-through slot and it has a 45 watt	0.700184606110839
0	laser so that can do faster cuts well	0.7100139396451042
0	for the average consumer	0.7191726632257093
0	definitely including myself this is	0.7239196775044268

0	than that it just looks amazing in its	0.0739877786081681
0	current configuration at CES is these	0.08137336791664834
0	huge 200 millimeter fans behind the	0.09126478216907724
0	acrylic in the front of the case this	0.10326636479535763
0	won't come with the case the standard or	0.11289400800105509
0	the upgraded RGB version but you'll be	0.12172594188244604
0	able to add them yourself if you want to	0.13240866927506925
0	have a different configuration than	0.14085373895458742
0	these 200 millimeter fans up in the	0.14718424407614192
0	front you can have up to three 120	0.1556205213874357
0	millimeter fans or two 140 millimeter	0.16485690420714819
0	fans moving inside the case from there	0.17606717369323427
0	you can see this awesome radiator that's	0.18503538928210314
0	mounted on the right hand side you could	0.19215720754385193
0	set up this current configuration with	0.2003341099925265
0	three 120 millimeter fans or go down to	0.20851101244120104
0	two or one and then in the back there's	0.2195893964039214
0	a 140 millimeter fan placed there	0.23000835274981316
0	currently that should come with both	0.2388402866312041
0	versions of the case that you could buy	0.2471490746032444
0	but it would be a different fan than the	0.2537433507715303
0	one that's currently in here but you	0.2615245966501077
0	could tone that down to 120 if you	0.26811887281839364
0	wanted in terms of where all these crazy	0.27801028707082254
0	fans are gonna actually breathe from	0.2863190750428628
0	because you see this huge acrylic panel	0.29436848815228384
0	on the front and this nice curved	0.3030685365103091
0	acrylic panel on the side the front ones	0.3107222930496329
0	will breathe in through the side there's	0.32100936387215895
0	grills along there they're fairly large	0.327076097946982
0	that won't give them the most amount of	0.3360399173517387
0	airflow but it is a huge amount of fans	0.3432980173209654
0	that you can mount there so it should	0.35437640128368575
0	breathe pretty okay and this radiator	0.3589879984173737
0	placement just on the inside of the case	0.36927946542401197
0	should be able to breathe super easily	0.37587374159229786
0	as it has its own cutout in the back so	0.38339121642414387
0	the huge fans in the front are able to	0.3957884556205214
0	feed both the back fan and the radiator	0.40383347254583024
0	fans that are just mounted on the inside	0.4153075130786477
0	and just in front of the power supply if	0.42190178924693367
0	you do go with the vertical GPU mount	0.4325845166395569
0	you can see here in this current	0.44102519013496283
0	configuration that they have the pump	0.4478832373499802
0	and the reservoir mounted very nicely	0.455005055611729
0	right behind there so you can have a	0.4626544159669407
0	whole bunch of really tight nice water	0.46938057765859237
0	cooling setups like they have with their	0.47966764848111837

0	Gender neutral males were known as were men females were known as women	0.5392853186277526
0	I will say personally the the idea that someone could be offended by the term mankind or human	0.5434828099804281

0	It being was like what before you finish talking we prefer people kind	0.5561122121148709
0	It would be very hard for me to not tell that person to go fuck themselves	0.5605805093612674
0	It's that level of pushing political correctness that	0.5632024027868389
0	Personally has pushed me more and more from the left to the right that said there is still a good number of people that were	0.5657627494183828
0	Happy that their prime minister said this, but what was very confusing is the update to the story?	0.5718066445918832
0	He's now saying that that moment was a joke I made a dumb joke a few days ago	0.5777520648949396
0	That seems to have gone a little viral in the room on the people claim comment	0.583968291091717
0	And he also said that it played well in the room but out of context	0.5904553231822154
0	It didn't look so great	0.5941850589002818
0	And if you look at the full video before the the 22 seconds that has been going around like crazy	0.5954406134984429
0	Yeah, this woman kind of going on a rant about power of women God	0.5996504142099238
0	The mother womanly love and near the end she comes back to mankind so I guess that was the joke	0.6041925676091532
0	But at that point the story seemingly	0.6112089021282882
0	changes from Trudeau what he why he did it what he meant by it's not even that it was the	0.6132891837664176
0	Reception so with that side with the newer information does that change your mind on this situation also?	0.619677740986472
0	What do you think in general well let's talk about updates around the Cape Town water	0.6245399377146444
0	Crisis day 0 still coming up a zero is what the government's calling it when the water storage drops to	0.6284296950971824
0	13.5 percent at that point they're going to turn the taps off to everywhere except hospitals and other vital locations and at that point while	0.6347813242408203

0	It was pushed back to April 16 and the news that we're getting today is the projection for day zero has been moved to May	0.6650364972488583
0	11 and this appears to be for multiple reasons	0.6707985081057127
0	But primarily due to the drop in water usage for	0.6729034084614532
0	agricultural purposes in a statement Cape Town deputy mayor Ian Nielson said the drop in	0.6757961077807457
0	agricultural water use of gives Cape Town and some of the other municipalities	0.6807075419441402

0	450 million liters per day to prevent the remaining water supplies running out before the arrival of the anticipated winter rains we cannot accurately	0.687797732616108
0	Predict the volume of rainfall still to come or when it will come we've also seen the other great news that multiple regions in South	0.6956264848164059
0	Africa have stepped up and donated about a billion liters of water to Cape Town additionally this week	0.7018907175125247

0	Could be as much as 2.6. Billion gallons of water from their private dams to help Cape Town	0.7141889978950996

0	Expect the same kind of recovery as we've seen in the past in situations like this now	0.758847351641453
0	I say that because a NASA study found that drought recoveries are taking longer and longer and are expect to become more severe and frequent	0.7632294833762109

0	What other cities are we going to potentially see have this same crisis in the near future and what considers do to prevent this we?	0.7770405839559817
0	Need to be asking these questions and getting those answers	0.7846108396213641
0	And then let's talk about the impending	0.7874173734290181
0	Government shutdown in the United States that may not actually come to be without a budget bill signed in the House and Senate by tomorrow	0.7893499427614815
0	Night the government will begin to shut down again	0.7963908959982274
0	We've seen some moves over the past 24 hours that makes it seem very likely that	0.798643508659634
0	That is not going to happen now the first thing we saw yesterday the House passed a short-term spending bill that would keep the government	0.8027179064242543
0	running for another month now a short-term bill of course not ideal at	0.8089082829675402
0	Kind of kicking the can down the road or you're gonna have the same	0.8127611122736617
0	Potential problem in a month and while that stopgap bill from the house is technically going to the Senate today	0.8162815888920346
0	It is very likely going to die there and the reason for that is Senate leaders have now announced their own	0.821698937702335
0	Bipartisan deal one. That would actually fund the government for two years	0.8273243146764485
0	I'm pleased to announce that we have reached a two-year budget deal to lift the spending caps for defense and	0.8309666539469959
0	urgent domestic priorities far above current spending levels	0.8396952202759759
0	Is that a plan reportedly increases the limits for defense and non-defense spending by almost three hundred billion?	0.8443112298280383

0	The bill and we had Schumer announcing at a vote on this bill would come later this week now could this somehow still fail	0.8795270744346927
0	Yes, well of course we do often see people voting down party lines	0.8855217321729711
0	That's not always the case for example House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced this morning that she won't support any	0.8891406836617881
0	Senate bill unless Paul Ryan commits to vote on an immigration deal and immigration in general in a deal for daca could also be something	0.8953076724233434
0	That holds suspect we had Trump yesterday saying immigration and border security needed to happen	0.9024594098893388
0	Otherwise he welcomed to shut down if we don't change it	0.9068550819187828
0	Let's have a shutdown will do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country	0.9098831841849359
0	I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of	0.9156181144524181
0	So we have to strengthen our borders not by a little bit, but by a lot	0.9210834697620601
0	and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety and	0.925391745343985
0	Unrelated but still related they don't want to take care of our military	0.9313864030822634
0	Then shut it down	0.9362239810928249
0	We'll go with another shutdown the question becomes what will the president think about this bipartisan deal. He doesn't like it. He says	0.9385886089193614
0	He'll veto it unless it addresses	0.9452221223796452
0	specifically his concerns	0.9471546917121088
0	then you need a different number of votes also the question becomes how many Republicans will agree with Trump here and can it pass the	0.9489887861741282
0	Senate can it pass the House and on the other side will there be more Democrats like Pelosi	0.9559694235527272
0	We just have to wait and see what happened	0.9603269365698741
0	but at the very least we can say is for the first time in a while it seems that even even if it's just	0.9628368148303155
0	Minimal appears that there are actually people in Congress from opposite sides that are willing to make a compromise	0.9685360479572619
0	But once again it could fall apart	0.9746550302194759

0	 So there is a fantastic list on Wikipedia called 'Wikipedia: Unusual Items'.	0.0016279069767441861
0	 I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.	0.01744186046511628
0	 It is a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected and incredible subjects.	0.02616279069767442
0	 Whichever link you click, it is guaranteed to be interesting.	0.040697674418604654
0	 And that is why I am going to click on a new link	0.04941860465116279
0	 and you learn a bit more about our amazing world.	0.059593023255813955
0	 Today we are going to make a trip.	0.06976744186046512
0	 We are going to escape the stiff boundaries of the earth.	0.0755813953488372
0	 Up to the heavens.	0.08372093023255814
0	 We travel through the galaxy.	0.0872093023255814
0	 To learn about keeping time, on the red planet.	0.09302325581395349
0	 Mars.	0.1002906976744186
0	 But before we can keep track of the time on Mars,	0.10465116279069768
0	 we must first understand how we keep time on the earth.	0.11046511627906977
0	 Damn. Ehm. Can we ... can we turn this thing around?	0.11773255813953488
0	 OK. So this is the Greenwich Observatory, in England.	0.13924418604651162
0	 Greenwich is known as the place where the prime meridian lies.	0.14825581395348839
0	 For clarity, this is the middle of the earth in length.	0.1569767441860465
0	 For the sake of clarity we say that time is determined on the basis of the sun.	0.1686046511627907
0	 However, this is not entirely true, so I have another video in which time is explained in more detail.	0.1816860465116279
0	 When the sun is at its highest in the air at a random location, we call it 12:00 in the afternoon.	0.19476744186046513
0	 And the time during the rest of the day is relative to this.	0.20784883720930233
0	 So let's go south now, to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.	0.21569767441860466
0	 We are in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.	0.22819767441860464
0	 Just as the prime meridian is the middle of the earth in length,	0.23546511627906977
0	 the equator is the center of the earth in width.	0.24709302325581395
0	 At this point of 0 ° length and 0 ° width,	0.2558139534883721
0	 It is 12:00, because the sun is at its highest point in the air.	0.26482558139534884
0	 Beautiful. When we go 1000 ° to the east,	0.2747093023255814
0	 we are in the nice village of Etoumbi, in the Republic of Congo.	0.2866279069767442
0	 In Etoumbi it is 13:00 in the afternoon,	0.2982558139534884
0	 because the sun was here at its highest point an hour ago.	0.30697674418604654
0	 This is why we have time zones.	0.313953488372093
0	 Since the earth revolves every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.	0.31976744186046513
0	 But wait a minute, I lied. The earth does not do 24 hours to do a round,	0.3313953488372093
0	 That is because there are actually two definitions of 'one day'.	0.3555232558139535
0	 The usual definition is a solar day.	0.3648255813953488
0	 That is the time between 12:00 noon, when the sun is at its highest in the air.	0.37209302325581395
0	 The more scientific definition is a star day.	0.3816860465116279
0	 That is the time it takes the earth to turn 360 ° around its axis	0.39244186046511625
0	 and therefore also the time it takes for a star to appear in the same place	0.40406976744186046
0	 between one and the other day.	0.4127906976744186
0	 There is a difference between star days and sunny days	0.4186046511627907
0	 because the earth revolves around its own axis and around the sun.	0.4273255813953488
0	 So, look at this.	0.4380813953488372
0	 Let's put a point on a spot on the earth and flush a star day.	0.4418604651162791
0	 You will see that the same point is not the closest yet	0.45494186046511625
0	 is in the sun because the earth also revolves around the sun.	0.4636627906976744
0	 To bring the point as close as possible to the sun,	0.4738372093023256
0	 we have to go 4 minutes ahead and now one solar day has passed.	0.4808139534883721
0	 Those 4 minutes count perfectly up to about 24 hours, spread over a year.	0.49127906976744184
0	 This means that a star day is more than solar days per year.	0.5058139534883721
0	 Okay, now we can go to Mars.	0.5174418604651163
0	 That was quick.	0.5232558139534884
0	 Mars is a planet that looks quite like the earth and time works in a similar way.	0.5290697674418605
0	 It has a prime meridian ... here.	0.5415697674418605
0	 Strangely enough, astronomers chose this prime meridian before it was chosen from the earth.	0.5494186046511628
0	 According to the same principle as the Greenwich Mean Time,	0.5625
0	 there is a coordinated Mars time called MTC.	0.5720930232558139
0	 But in general, robot cars use Mars	0.5808139534883721
0	 just the time of the place where they land.	0.5886627906976745
0	 This is almost the same as how places on earth	0.5988372093023255
0	 determined their time before coordinated time zones existed.	0.6075581395348837
0	 Each place on earth determined the time with the highest position of the sun as 12:00 in the afternoon.	0.6162790697674418
0	 However, this became difficult when ways were found to travel quickly between places,	0.627906976744186
0	 since nobody knew more then what time it was.	0.6395348837209303
0	 If you want to know more about this, you can view my other video over time.	0.6441860465116279
0	 Since there have only been 11 operational spacecraft on Mars,	0.6598837209302325
0	 the use of times based on the sun has never caused problems.	0.6715116279069767
0	 That means, however, that even the seconds are not coordinated between the different robot cars.	0.684593023255814
0	 What is a little tricky is that a day on Mars takes a little longer than a day on earth.	0.6991279069767442
0	 Everyone who has watched The Martian, knows that a solar day on Mars is called a Sol.	0.713953488372093
0	 Robot trucks on Mars generally work only during the day,	0.747093023255814
0	 partly because some work on solar energy	0.7543604651162791
0	 and partly because a lot of work is carried through cameras and enough light is needed.	0.7601744186046512
0	 That is why the teams that run the robot cars on Mars from the earth live	0.7732558139534884
0	 based on time on Mars.	0.7834302325581395
0	 Their shifts shift every day for 40 minutes to coordinate it	0.7892441860465116
0	 with the time that it is light on Mars.	0.8008720930232558
0	 Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory	0.8066860465116279
0	 who has worked on the Spirit and Opportunity programs, says that	0.8168604651162791
0	 scientists who work with robot trucks sometimes have two watches,	0.8459302325581395
0	 one for the time on Mars and one for the time on earth.	0.8561046511627907
0	 So when we go to Mars we have to create time zones and use the coordinated time.	0.8633720930232558
0	 Having different time standards in different places always causes problems,	0.8808139534883721
0	 especially for computers and communication.	0.8938953488372093
0	 This is of course only one of the many details that we need to figure out before we start living on the red planet.	0.9011627906976745
0	 I hope you enjoyed the episode of this week, it was a lot more instructive than last week's	0.9273255813953488
