0	pressing this macro key in the corner	0.4007648953301127

0	vertically so the water goes up into the	0.7011876006441223

0	what if you're looking for something	0.33731929323576654
0	kind of like that except you have like a	0.3418659646617883
0	lot of money to spend and you want like	0.35190522934142426
0	the best one well then you might be	0.36020435480992324

0	great opportunity to check out those	0.5921381402819917

0	what and they're estimating that pricing	0.6145814742102446
0	is going to be under $1,000 which	0.6329644833125112
0	doesn't sound that amazing for like a	0.6455470283776549

0	figure it out on the fly	0.7103337497769052
0	it's pretty impressive at least to me	0.7166250223094771

0	hopefully I'm allowed to do that and you	0.7341156523291094

0	Tuesday, Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it.	0.002960504258029907
0	And the first thing I want to talk about today because	0.006996133127696194
0	there's so much negativity in the news is a	0.00921902590580925
0	Positive story	0.011734728089586267
0	a positive story about my new personal hero Elizabeth Swaney.	0.013992266255392388
0	Elizabeth Swaney's a 33 year old American woman.	0.016115693243031807
0	She's been freestyle skiing since 2013. She's had the goal of making the Olympics.	0.018942086322895013
0	And this year she did just that, she went to the Olympics	0.02362591922036702
0	but you may not have heard of her because she finished	0.02601645097118845
0	24th (last place).  This in the women's ski halfpipe	0.028174523346520933
0	And as far as why she ended up in last place	0.03182905295156351
0	It was because she really didn't attempt any tricks.	0.03322604439079997
0	I can't show you the video for legal reasons	0.03624354589955073
0	but when she would get to the top of the halfpipe where people would normally do a trick she would just then go back down.	0.03798587362256644
0	For her two runs she receive the scores 30 and 31.4.	0.044424327767719436
0	I laughed because her best score was still 13.6 points behind 23rd place	0.047575940454636895
0	And that was Denmark's Laila Friis-Salling	0.05257158184134648
0	and she slipped on both runs. So the question becomes well	0.05534321285679161
0	Why did Elizabeth Swaney not do any tricks and how the hell is she in the Olympics?? Well my friends it is because Elizabeth	0.05762310288562552
0	Swaney is a damn American hero. A woman with the very American mindset of "It doesn't matter if I'm qualified to do it	0.06394868012248821
0	I'm gonna figure out a way how to get there!" Elizabeth knowing she didn't have a good chance of competing with the US team originally	0.07226357316882362
0	Competed for Venezuela where her mother is from later switching to Hungary where her grandparents were from.	0.07771742774760276
0	She actually ended up becoming Hungary's first	0.08267954133977067
0	Olympic freestyle skier after qualifying both through the country's quota system as well as placing where she needed to place	0.08449004224502112
0	among 13 World Cup halfpipe contests.	0.0898980755045933
0	Now when you hear that she placed where she needed to place you go, oh okay,	0.09198015154563133
0	Well, she beat out other athletes. Not really, pretty much every event she went to she placed last or near last.	0.0960895415632893
0	But Elizabeth realized she could game the system. According to the rules, to qualify for the halfpipe at the Olympic Games	0.10189096761215047
0	athletes must record a number of top 30 finishes.	0.10733364625941572
0	And so what Swaney ended up doing was just going to competitions with fewer than 30 competitors!	0.11020586065848588
0	And so by technicality she was satisfying the requirements.	0.11563736337423725
0	In fact, the best Swaney has ever placed is thirteenth out of fifteen. And so she met those basic requirements	0.11929189297927982
0	She raised funds through online donation sites	0.12505755604729654
0	So she could pay for all of this.	0.1275386128433805
0	And according to reports there were a few competitors that had to be pulled out of the Olympics due to injury,	0.12908200898544894
0	there's the limit on how many skiers a single country can have in one same event, and then you pair that with some	0.13353002972797784
0	reallocation rules within the Hungarian Ski Federation	0.13931804465902234
0	designed to balance men and women's competitors and Swaney got through! Now because Swaney was able to pull this off,	0.14169963566463264
0	There are people that are angry and also people calling for change. A Hungarian team	0.14708643465432844
0	Spokesman telling Reuters	0.15167862491338652
0	"We, the Hungarian Olympic Committee have to learn the lessons from this case, and we must consider rethinking our	0.1530432061512327
0	nomination procedures." "We shall be doing this with the assistance of the appropriate experts, in the near future."	0.15813943092156732
0	At least one fan saying, "It's so sad to me that anyone thinks what Elizabeth Swaney did is in any way admirable. I get that it's her dream,	0.16457676747356892
0	but it's also a dream of the thousands of elite athletes who train endlessly. There's nothing admirable about a loophole."	0.17034354813473704
0	Another saying, "Terribly disrespectful,	0.17637743355908714
0	I'm sorry to hear someone from the USA would game the system like that, but not surprised either."	0.17802141308478062
0	But others like the Canadian skier Cassie Sharpe who actually who actually won	0.1820782762243233
0	the gold medal in the women's halfpipe final said, "If you're going to put in that time and effort to be here,	0.18509577773307406
0	Then you deserve to be here as much as I do.	0.18905093989584032
0	My official response to any Elizabeth Swaney haters out there is	0.19072844721607546
0	don't hate the player, hate the game.	0.19392476362904848

0	What's in the rulebook of whatever you're doing in life? For some things like an actual sport?	0.20970406133351216
0	There is an actual rulebook. In life,	0.2140637922170813
0	You have laws.	0.21642191376651243
0	And if you take the time to actually look at the rules unlike other people who are just gonna rely on things	0.2175506828494155
0	Like raw talent, and you give yourself an advantage or at the very least like in this situation a way in where otherwise there would not have	0.22280337066094458
0	been one. So Elizabeth Swaney, from one hustler to another, I salute you.	0.22944187398019625
0	Then let's talk about the situation around Blac	0.23324169069491943
0	Chyna. If you're not familiar with Blac Chyna, she's a former stripper, model, turned reality star	0.23514159905228102
0	Overall seemingly a person that's famous for no reason. You might have seen yesterday that she was trending all over Twitter	0.2409530834395047
0	And it was because there was a one-minute video of her performing oral sex on at that time an unidentified man. Now as of right now	0.24620577125103377
0	It's unclear who posted the first video, Blac Chyna and her lawyers say they're already asking the police to investigate the leak. At this time	0.2531348487896466
0	She has not made any public statements,	0.2589563915152328
0	but her attorneys are speaking out. One of her lawyers, Lisa Bloom writing on Twitter yesterday:	0.26063278124231654
0	"Revenge porn -- posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse.	0.2646907619750106
0	It's also a way to try to slut-shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It's not a joke."	0.27121750597912336
0	It's actually that part of the story and the general reaction	0.277856009298375
0	I saw online that made me want to talk about this story. Because online the number one reaction to this video was an outrage. It	0.28024654104919644
0	was making fun of Blac Chyna for being bad at giving head. I mean this video guy leaked and just seven minutes later	0.2867509331902814
0	It was memes galore.	0.29275240841324124
0	We also saw a lot of people addressing the issue of the leak saying China has no reason to be upset because she agreed to be	0.2942399248977402
0	video taped, so she shouldn't be upset if it leaked. And we've talked about this before I'll say it again	0.29987147678759024
0	And it's not white knighting it is just stating the facts,	0.30376181854757595
0	It is a consent issue. Just because you do something that makes it possible for someone to do something	0.30753928339927133
0	horrible to you does it make it okay?	0.31221082277207807
0	Like if you give someone a key to your house you	0.31451306466393975
0	trust this person and then maybe things go bad and then that person gives copies of your keys out. It's not okay	0.31664766758309304
0	you didn't give them permission. If you decide to film yourself in a sexual situation with one other person	0.3229061892308724
0	That's a just for you thing!	0.3274547933570263
0	You're not consenting to the entirety of the internet seeing it. It can happen	0.3291077136279309
0	which is why I advise if you're not okay with it never film anything like this	0.3332316323565569
0	but that doesn't put the woman or the person that is the victim in this situation in the wrong.	0.33829544692550123
0	I just think that in general	0.3430563937504191
0	It's important to remember that whether whether it be a reality star or whether it be someone	0.343682245915197
0	maybe you don't like, when something illegal happens to someone we	0.34872259102796216
0	Shouldn't just cheer it on. We shouldn't  make fun of the victim. Also at the same time, I kind of want to say anyone	0.35235476876997696
0	that's ever faked leaks in the past for free promotion	0.35750575560472964
0	which is essentially faking a crime. Fuck those people!	0.3614620353606473
0	Because their actions in the past have trained people to just believe that this is all part	0.36469299716131337
0	of the PR site.	0.3689163816804131
0	That said, for this specific story we now have Blac Chyna's	0.3707503520418427
0	Ex-boyfriend Mechi coming forward saying he's actually the unidentified guy in the video. He's reportedly angry	0.3729408346185655
0	he said he's never possessed the video that it was taken on Blac Chyna's phone. As of right now who posted the video	0.37792418248060977
0	we don't know, a lot of people have been pointing to Rob	0.38315563602226244
0	Kardashian. This because he posted private photos of Blac Chyna on the internet before on all his own social media.	0.38557969556762556
0	And so that's where we are as of right now around this specific story	0.3914370012740562
1	We'll see if there's anything that comes from the police investigation	0.3943539193991819
1	but it was less about the	0.39710319855159926

0	links as always in the description down below. Then, in potentially big news around gun laws and gun	0.4663716220746999
0	regulation: Donald Trump spoke about bump stocks today. "After the deadly shooting in Las Vegas	0.4716690136122846
0	I directed Attorney General to clarify whether certain bump stock	0.47722345157468876
0	devices like the one used in Las Vegas	0.4833590379758153
0	are illegal under current law. That process began in December and	0.4875611882250386
0	Just a few moments ago,	0.494635552873332
0	I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General	0.4977201099711661
0	to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.	0.5027157513578757
0	I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized,	0.5113323945550862
0	Jeff, very soon." So potential change in coming it'll be interesting to see what the debate in Congress looks like,	0.5164621471199624
0	But there's not much for me to add here because this literally happened after I was done with the show	0.5224189186168667
0	but I wanted to make sure we included it. That said whether you're pro-gun anti-gun	0.527146337647243
0	I'd love to know your thoughts on this specific topic. Then and potentially the sexiest story of the day today. Today let's talk about	0.5303985337177853
0	gerrymandering. ;)	0.5371823241467176
0	Fuck was that? Yes gerrymandering. Try and keep it together as we talk about congressional district maps okay?	0.5393281029973849
0	I mean seriously if someone's not listening with headphones	0.5462907083305394
0	Someone's gonna come by. Enough of that! In June of 2017 a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Pennsylvania congressional district map was infringing on	0.5493529135653457
0	constitutional rights of voters according to the state constitution.	0.5569860747893337
0	This due to partisan gerrymandering. And for those new to the topic of gerrymandering, the	0.5601153356132234
0	definition of gerrymandering is to "divide (a	0.5644739489036411
0	territorial unit) into election districts to give one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts while	0.5669550056997251
0	concentrating the voting strength of the opposition in as few districts as possible."	0.5735935090189768
0	Long story short what it ends up doing is it fucks with the proper representation	0.5776168443639778
0	of a state. When you look at how some of the districts were carved up to favor Republicans	0.5815284203938398
0	It doesn't even look like they were trying to hide it. Like look at this one	0.5864681821229799
0	This is a real district in Pennsylvania. It's nicknamed Goofy kicking Donald Duck.	0.5897762578510919
0	And it's districts being carved up like that that resulted in Republicans holding 13 out of the 18 congressional districts in the state.	0.5946489639911486
0	Despite statewide voting being closer to 50/50. Now on January 22nd of this year the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state's congressional	0.6004157446523167
0	district map was	0.6078924428351103
0	unconstitutional. That decision stating that the map clearly plainly and palpably violates the Constitution the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.	0.6094347213840273
0	The ruling gave lawmakers until February 9th to create a new district map saying if they do not by then the court welcomed all	0.6161961599499318
0	parties and intervenors to submit maps. After this we saw members of the state GOP enter an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, the	0.6228123114061557
0	Court rejected that request, and though the court didn't explicitly state	0.6294396387938934
0	why, some speculate it was because the decision considered the state constitution instead of the federal one.	0.632591251480811
0	Then we get the big news yesterday the Pennsylvania Supreme Court announces the new map using	0.6375533650729789
0	population and geographical compactness to redraw the districts. The decision stating that no revised map was agreed upon by the	0.6420572654730772
0	legislature,	0.6484498982990232
0	So it fell to the court. Ultimately what we see with this new map was it makes seven competitive GOP held districts more	0.649098102326829
0	Democratic. Three of the districts that Trump won by more than 20% could actually be competitive in the midterm,	0.6544625494534969
0	and what we could expect to maybe see is four to six of the seats switching to the Democrats favor. And the court decision instructs	0.659312903730526
0	the 2018 election to use this new map and candidates have until March 20th to register for the primary. Now of course as expected there	0.6646773508571939
0	were a lot of reactions to this news.	0.6711146874091956
0	Pennsylvania Governor and Democrat Tom Wolf saying, "I applaud the court for their decision and I respect their effort to remedy Pennsylvania's unfair and unequal	0.6728357808623349
0	congressional elections." Former attorney General Eric Holder and the chairman of the National Democratic	0.67994367330517
0	Redistricting committee said the new map is "A major victory in the fight against gerrymandering in	0.6843916940476988
0	Pennsylvania and around the country." At the same time we had House Speaker Mike Turzai, Senate President pro tempore	0.6893538076398668
0	Joe Scarnati, both Republicans saying in a joint statement,	0.6944500324102014
0	"Implementation of this map would create a constitutional crisis where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is usurping the authority of the legislative and executive branches."	0.6978475155904245
0	Also calling the decision  "the ultimate partisan gerrymander, one brought about by the Democrat governor acting in concert with liberal politically connected	0.7050895192114263
0	litigants."	0.7126668007778448
0	And we also heard from President Trump who tweeted "Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania	0.7132255973535394
0	challenge the new "pushed" Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct!	0.7171930530409709
0	Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!" And ultimately I'm of the mindset of	0.7232168801269586
0	The closer we can get to proper representation when it comes to voting, the better. I hate	0.7287824940208767
0	that this has somehow become partisan politics, both parties in the past have been guilty of gerrymandering. The Republicans just	0.7332975703524889
0	did a fantastic job over the past decade. And once again like with the Elizabeth Swaney situation,	0.7399360736717405
0	there is part of me that appreciates playing that rule book hard.	0.74412704798945
0	But unlike in The Swaney situation, it ultimately results in the taking away of someone's voice. Somewhat the effectiveness of someone's vote.	0.7480162721562842
0	There's no reason than when you look to Pennsylvania, which is a very 50/50 state that the breakdown in districts should be 13 to 18.	0.7542859697355775
0	50% does not equal 72%.	0.7616397326717181
0	Even if it was like a split of ten Republican seats and eight Democrat seats, then it could be like okay well	0.7641878450568855
0	that's just the way the split went, but here	0.7688370325666645
0	It's so obvious. What I would like to remind the Republicans who were against this redistricting is that	0.7707145890609982
0	sometimes you end up creating your own future problems. People's opinions change,	0.7758778694204161
0	they evolve,	0.7803705938890007
0	different people come into power,	0.7815999463555288
0	different people will be able to pull the same tricks as you. One of the instances that comes to mind is when we look back	0.7832539842195847
0	to 2013. The Senate Democrats they pulled that nuclear option, only need 50 votes	0.7883837367844609
0	and then they lost their damn mind when the Republicans did it last year.	0.7934464337602539
0	That's also probably gonna fall on deaf ears because for most politicians	0.7976709358725049
0	It's all about the net. Actually on the note of only thinking about them now	0.8004202150249223
0	I want to talk about Donald Trump and Mitt Romney.	0.8039406334517982
0	Because in the past week Mitt Romney announced that he's going to be running for a Senate seat in Utah. Yesterday	0.8061869956860904
0	we saw the president tweet "Mitt Romney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful state of Utah.	0.8107132479492166
0	He will make a great senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch,	0.8151724446232593
0	and has my full support and endorsement!" Mitt Romney responding "Thank You Mr. President for the support.	0.8177540848029683
0	I hope that over the course of the campaign	0.8220121147097611
0	I also earn the support and endorsement of the people of Utah."	0.8235543932586781
0	And understandably people from both sides were kind of surprised by this. One, because since	0.8261807371644426
0	2016 Mitt Romney has said stuff like this about Donald Trump Donald Trump. "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud.	0.8309081561948188
0	His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the members of the American public for suckers.	0.8370772703904871
0	he gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat." And I've seen some people say well of	0.8441851628333221
0	course he's going to say "Thank you!"	0.8500413509466014
0	Why why would he cause a fire? And to that people pointed out that once again in	0.8516171572900602
0	2016 Mitt Romney tweeted "If Trump had said four years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims Mexicans,	0.8557857797447417
0	disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement." Now as of early 2018 it appears Mitt	0.8621560607076599
0	Romney's of a different mind, which is strange considering in	0.8675763874918975
0	2017 he criticized the president around Nazis. Donald Trump of course that is his infamous both sides comment after Charlottesville. Mitt Romney	0.8708062316994122
0	responded "No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes."	0.8780705871834418
0	Also, maybe this is a super recent change because January 15, 2018	0.8853349426674714
0	he criticized the president, writing "The poverty of an aspiring	0.8888888888888888
0	immigrant's nation of origin is as irrelevant as their race. The sentiment attributed to POTUS is	0.8919510941236952
0	inconsistent w/ America's history and antithetical to American values." And here's the thing, I don't care if you're Pro Trump	0.8965097565882116
0	You were one of the never Trump errs, which Mitt Romney appeared to be back in the day?	0.901662978609267
0	How do you trust Mitt Romney? Because if you're anti Trump it appears that Mitt Romney who has been so outspoken against Trump has finally	0.9056293167035473
0	Bent the knee, he's kissing the ring, and if you're Pro Trump. He seems like a wolf in sheep's clothing.	0.912256644091285
0	He's just going to do this to secure the vote and then he's not gonna be on Trump's team when he's in the Senate.	0.9178680793044101
0	And I also wonder if this is part of Mitt	0.9232548782941058
0	Romney's strategy, because that was something that seemingly helped Donald Trump during the 2016 election.	0.9247289836607882
0	I knew a good number of people that when they looked at Trump. They were like no he's just trying to trick Republicans.	0.9304287087328729
0	He's just saying big crazy shit like that wall so they're on board, but he's when he gets in there	0.9358948568363173
0	he's gonna switch it up.	0.9420304432374439
0	He's our Trojan horse, so it's not crazy to think that the Republicans who have been anti Trump thinking oh okay,	0.943001631686001
0	Mitt Romney's our Trojan horse. Honestly who knows? He's a career politician who knows where he lies? That said,	0.9480643286617939

0	their short throw 4k laser projector	0.048114226292844856
0	technology this one differs from	0.06311242650881894
0	previous iterations in that it is a	0.07571091469023718
0	little bit more furniture like in its	0.08482982042154942
0	implementation so instead of just	0.09562852457705076
0	containing a 4k laser projector it also	0.10678318601767788
0	has a built in shelf and maybe the	0.12118545774507058
0	powers coming back on now nope they were	0.1339039315282166
0	just informing us that there is a power	0.20973483182018157
0	outage we noticed thank you sorry for	0.21692996840379156
0	that so in a nutshell it is a more	0.2372075350957885
0	complete package than ever before and	0.24669039715234173
0	that's why it actually costs more so	0.25880494340679117
0	while the last generation had a couple	0.2678078630564332
0	of cabinets and speakers this one has a	0.2765668119825621
0	shelf which is cool because you can put	0.2877214734231892
0	your xbox excuse me your your	0.29984401871775385
0	PlayStation down there and it also has	0.31112266528016636
0	three excuse me five speakers and a	0.3202415710114786
0	subwoofer so there's two tweeters using	0.3337999440067192
0	Sony's advanced vertical drive so	0.3436387633483982
0	they're actually glass and they radiate	0.35251769787625487
0	sound in all directions and there are	0.36271247450305966
0	three mid-range speakers built into the	0.3725552933647962
0	chassis with one of them actually firing	0.3811942566891973
0	out the back that acts as a centre	0.3913930328360597
0	speaker so it's it's pointed at the wall	0.40351157861056675
0	and then it bounces the sound towards	0.41131064272287327
0	the viewer the sub is actually the big	0.4205455345358557
0	thing that's kind of at the back near	0.4326680798304203
0	the bottom and from listening to it it's	0.44130704315482144
0	actually surprising how much sound	0.45210574731032277
0	they've managed to pack into this little	0.45978482582090147
0	package now let's talk about the image	0.4689037315522137
0	so it actually uses pretty similar tech	0.4794624645042595
0	to Sony's last generation solution so	0.48930128384593846
0	it's still a single laser DLP but that's	0.49853617565892094
0	without a spinning colour wheel so you	0.5082550093988721
0	shouldn't see any rainbow effect and it	0.5153301603807543
0	can handle a maximum image size of a	0.5236131664200296
0	hundred and	0.5309362876454825
0	20 inches at only nine and a half inches	0.5340959084909811
0	from the wall so that's actually pretty	0.5452505699316083
0	similar to what we're looking at right	0.5522097348318202
0	here it's 4k it's HDR it has a maximum	0.5606127264728232
0	luminance of 2500 lumens and they're	0.5769307683078031
0	planning to make it available in the US	0.5864096308442986
0	sometime this spring now it's gonna cost	0.5934887813462385
0	you a pretty penny at about $30,000 but	0.607883054033516
0	if you think of it more in terms of like	0.6233611966564012
0	fancy furniture pricing and less in	0.6314842218933728
0	terms of firing a laser projected image	0.6455585329760428
0	at your wall pricing then maybe that	0.6596008478982522
0	starts to get a little bit more	0.6714754229492461
0	reasonable if you're into that sort of	0.6769947606287245
0	thing I mean you got your engineered	0.6823981122265328
0	marble top you got your design that I	0.6893532776066872
0	think subjectively looks pretty darn	0.6982322121345439
0	good and neutral so it should look great	0.7074711034675839
0	in pretty much any space that's that's	0.715274167099948

0	400 spec which is kind of like guy it's	0.2790495049504951
0	like sort of related to HDR 10 but that	0.29108910891089107
0	would be like that thousand so it's like	0.30225742574257425
0	HDR thousand is a thousand its peak	0.3071247524752475
0	brightness and then there's like 600 and	0.314970297029703

0	 Peace be upon you, I'm Dustin, and welcome to "Every day smarter"	0.0
0	 I have just interviewed the President of the United States of America	0.005903995892872422
0	 It really is strange to me because I'm not a journalist	0.013647642679900745
0	 I'm not a politician, I'm a rocket engineer	0.01792590057328656
0	 I will, however, take a different view from the rest of the people	0.024386069992299135
0	 The interview with the president is something different because you learn a lot about it	0.03135963035851801
0	 The White House is also definitely, but you learn things about yourself as well	0.038889364250877044
0	 The video will contain 4 paragraphs	0.04522118593308805
0	 1. How it happened. 2. What were my goals from this interview	0.04847266193206126
0	 3. The interview is complete. 4. And what is declared of it.	0.05262257208864551
0	 What I understood is that there were many candidates to meet the president	0.05874048087618722
0	 At one point, it became one of the candidates most likely to do so	0.06353212971677932
0	 I did not register on the basis of liberal or democratic, and the question was asked: for the benefit of the voice	0.06879224779669718
0	 And I did not answer	0.0778642936596218
0	 But the way I answered it made it clear to me	0.08111576965859502
0	 I will not be selected for the interview	0.0870625481304013
0	 And it happened the opposite and I chose	0.09168306665525798
0	 It was a secret for 3 weeks and then went to Los Angeles to film an interview.	0.09429280397022333
0	 There she met Adnold and Ingrid	0.10122358175750834
0	 They were very fun and humble too	0.10635749122957132
0	 When I returned home I asked suggestions about the questions I should ask on the Internet	0.11063574912295714
0	 I received all kinds of answers	0.117309831436639
0	 I mean good and bad too. It was fun	0.12205869769829725
0	 But think about it, I do not agree with the president on all issues	0.12625139043381536
0	 So I learned it was a great opportunity in front of me	0.13301103790536495
0	 I was able to sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how to run the country in my view	0.13639086164113973
0	 Or I would accept that he sees things differently than I think	0.14742876700607513
0	 And to try a deep, intelligent and respectful interview.	0.15743989047659793
0	 My goal was not only a smart and respectable interview	0.16449901600068453
0	 With someone I may not share my opinion on some topics	0.17142979378796955
0	 But I was hoping to prove that it would be fun.	0.17630700778642935
0	 For that, I went to Washington where I met the president.	0.18105587404808762
0	 Yesterday the meeting, we went to the studio	0.1865748267305553
0	 In Maryland, we trained on it with Frederic	0.19115256267647815
0	 He's a Google employee, a very funny man.	0.19645760246427654
0	 The next day, we went to the White House and we met a dog president	0.2027466415675537
0	 Which was in fact very soft.	0.20882176777616154
0	 We have settings and make sure we move correctly what we need	0.21339950372208435
0	 Each of us went to a corner to review the questions for the last time	0.21977410798322922
0	 To make sure we adjust what we say.	0.2266621031915804
0	 Then the President waited for us to come and we started the interview	0.2309403610849662
0	 The president had told us who we were	0.2375716608197142
0	 Susie would give him a light about the interview,	0.24283391802857876
0	 And then I was watching him with a video	0.24745443655343544
0	 Then Ingrid would ask him what was in his pocket.	0.25126208607854883
0	 Many people wanted to know, once I read these, cards	0.25613930007700864
0	 In the White House, these cards are available, before the interview.	0.2617866004962779
0	 The answer is: no.	0.26747668349448106
0	 What I did is	0.2701719859673141
0	 I looked him in the eye all the time	0.27226833233507314
0	 This was evident, through his physical expression	0.2790707623855566
0	 That makes him comfortable	0.28334902027894243

0	 Remember that until now the president is not aware of the quality of the interrogators I am.	0.36506374604261144
0	 For information, I could have been tough.	0.3749465217763327
0	 What happened next is something I will never forget	0.3785830409857106
0	 I learned that we were on the same wave,	0.3847009497732523
0	 I really wanted to make it clear to him,	0.39128946692906647
0	 He listened to him for 10 hours through recorded books.	0.39492598613844443

0	 He concluded by addressing the National Democratic Convention of 2004.	0.43283135107384274
0	 Did you see that? Let's go back and take a look at the language of his body.	0.4408316933344742
0	 He was discreet, and then the call happened.	0.4467784718062805
0	 Is not that great?	0.4520835115940789
0	 It was the moment when she was really interviewed	0.45435098827757336
0	 It became fun and smart	0.4597415932232395
0	 Between two people who want each one for the better one.	0.46603063232651665
0	 It was a wonderful moment, and I will never forget it.	0.47073671600924105

0	 It was clear to me that the country knows two poles very much about what it was before,	0.48074783947976385
0	 In fact, there are data to make sure.	0.4896893984769402
0	 Whatever your point of view, it has become very common to make fun of	0.49473774279113547

0	 The president explained why this is growing.	0.507829211944896

0	 Whatever the reason,	0.5224180713613417
0	 This is largely related, as you know, to the media	0.5274664156755369
0	 Some people only watch Fox News	0.5400444938820912
0	 Others do not, only read the New York Times,	0.545221185933088
0	 And so they are not starting from the common points between them.	0.5494994438264739

0	 This is dangerous.	0.6029348849148627
0	 There are no negative responses that bring you back to the moderate middle, and this will lead to extremism.	0.6066997518610422
0	 I liked what the President said on this point,	0.6181654830153162
0	 Because it is the responsibility of each of the parties in the political dialogue	0.6225720886455035
0	 To listen to the arguments of the other.	0.6318131256952169
