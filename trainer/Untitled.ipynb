      " That is a complicated but interesting answer. To keep it simple, and to ...\n",
      " not to exclude our European friends, we will focus on the European model of budget airlines.\n",
      " Although there are low-cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia and many other places ...\n",
      " budget airlines were the first successful in Europe and they are still today.\n",
      " The extent to which airlines such as Ryanair and\n",
      " EasyJet to reduce costs in Europe is also more significant than elsewhere in the world. Budget airlines in\n",
      " the US can be 10 to 20 percent cheaper than their traditional competitors, while in Europe\n",
      " the price of a budget airline only costs half or even a third of the price of one\n",
      " normal airline. You can regularly find flights of 2 to 3 hours with budget airlines for less than\n",
      " ten euro. So, how do they work? Not completely surprising\n",
      " Budget airlines take every expensive part of the flight and make it cheap.\n",
      " The most essential thing an airline needs is its planes and it is possible to save on this.\n",
      " In the months and years after 9/11 the growth of aviation stagnated\n",
      " most airlines had to fight to survive. Meanwhile, it went well with Ryanair and placed it\n",
      " a huge order of 151 737's from Boeing for an incredibly low price.\n",
      " Fortunately such a situation does not occur often, but budget airlines can always place large orders,\n",
      " what gives them a bulk discount. It may seem strange that a budget airline\n",
      " buy brand new planes, but the latest planes are the most efficient, saving fuel.\n",
      " The fuel efficiency of new aircraft outweighs the higher purchase price, so Easyjet (4.0),\n",
      " JetBlue (4.7), Ryanair (5.0) and Spirit Airlines (5.7) all have a younger fleet than any other major\n",
      " airline (KLM: 9.4, Air France: 11.5, Lufthansa: 12.4). Budget airlines usually have\n",
      " just one type of plane. Ryanair only has 737s and uses EasyJet alone\n",
      " the A320 family. One type of aircraft means pilots, flight attendants, mechanics\n",
      " and ground staff but need to be trained for one type of aircraft, which is a huge saving\n",
      " time and costs. Inside the aircraft, budget airlines often avoid unnecessary luxuries\n",
      " to keep costs low. For example, Ryanair seats can not be changed, because that is the\n",
      " purchase price would increase and more maintenance would take. The design of the chair\n",
      " saves the flight attendants time, because there are no bags on the seats that need to be cleaned between\n",
      " flights through. Stewardesses of budget airlines often stand by\n",
      " at the beginning of their career and get little training. They obviously get the\n",
      " necessary safety training, but little training in hospitality. In addition, they often fulfill\n",
      " multiple functions. When they have landed, some stewardesses will\n",
      " going to the gate to check tickets while others clean the plane. This saves\n",
      " the airline has three or four functions that it would otherwise have had to pay for. On board are flight attendants\n",
      " obviously responsible for eating and drinking, which is almost never free. Service on board\n",
      " can be a perfect way to earn extra money. Many budget airlines sell duty-free products\n",
      " and Ryanair even sells lots for a lottery.\n",
      " Let's talk about airports. You will never get Ryanair to London Heathrow or Paris\n",
      " Charles de Gaulle see flying because these airports are expensive. There is only a fixed number\n",
      " flights per day, making supply and demand ensure that\n",
      " the rate for the landing fee is high and the places are regulated. Instead Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted or Luton\n",
      " in London, or to Beauvais in Paris, which is also an 80-minute bus ride from Paris,\n",
      " technically not even in the same region as Paris and has a website that looks like this!\n",
      " In many cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of the few airlines that\n",
      " fly from that airport, which offers them a strong negotiating position. Often they will\n",
      " choose a small regional airport and rename it to another airport in a big city.\n",
      " They can ask for lower start and landing commissions and if the airport does not cooperate ...\n",
      " just threaten to leave the airport until the airport gives way. If there is no cheap,\n",
      " cost-effective airport in the vicinity of a city, budget airlines can also fly to regular airports\n",
      " during quieter hours, where landing fees and the chance of delays can be lower.\n",
      " Now let's look at the smallest details. The airlines of budget airlines\n",
      " are generally non-stop in use. This Ryanair plane, for example, went in one of Brussels\n",
      " to Copenhagen, from Copenhagen to Brussels, from Brussels to Prague, from Prague to Brussels, from Brussels\n",
      " to NÃ®mes, from NÃ®mes to Brussels, from Brussels to Treviso and finally from Treviso to Brussels.\n",
      " Budget airlines plan only between 30 and 45 minutes between the landing of a flight and the take-off\n",
      " the next flight, which often leads to delays and, moreover, has little time to clean the plane.\n",
      " However, this means that the aircraft always brings in money and passengers do not pay\n",
      " for the time the aircraft is stationary. Have you ever wondered why Southwest does not have reserved seats\n",
      " offers? Because the 'who-as-first-comes' system ensures that you almost always\n",
      " arrive at the gate well in time and set up in a neat line. This costs boarding\n",
      " less time and the plane is faster in the air. Another principle of budget airlines\n",
      " is the point-to-point model. Most traditional airlines have hubs, where most or all of them\n",
      " planes leave from. British Airways has London, Air France has Paris and KLM\n",
      " Amsterdam. To get to most places with these airlines, you need a connection to one of these\n",
      " \"hubs\". Budget airlines, however, try to have many destinations from many locations.\n",
      " However, this means that many destinations are only visited a few times a week.\n",
      " The cheapest budget airlines do not even allow connections between flights.\n",
      " This would increase costs because they would then have to pay ground staff to transfer baggage,\n",
      " make a more sophisticated ticket system and passengers to book when they are delayed\n",
      " miss their connection. Speaking of tickets, there is often no way for budget airlines\n",
      " get tickets from a real person. Ryanair charges 45 pounds\n",
      " if you forget to print your boarding pass and EasyJet and a number of other companies\n",
      " the check-in almost completely with machines. This also reduces staff costs.\n",
      " At airports, budget airlines do not want to use a trunk because they are expensive.\n",
      " Instead, they use stairs and let passengers walk across the platform or leave them one\n",
      " take a bus to get to the plane. Budget airlines earn a lot of money if they do well.\n",
      " EasyJet (11.15%), Ryanair (24.10%) and Wizz Air (10.2%) all have higher profit margins\n",
      " than Lufthansa (4.03%), British Airways (7.09%) and Air France (2.15%). Much of the\n",
      " traditional airlines have employees who are members of a trade union with salary agreements\n",
      " that can not be changed, while budget airlines can hire everyone and train in a few months.\n",
      " It is also difficult for traditional airlines to grow. There must be a lot of demand for each new route\n",
      " because a large share of their turnover comes from business travelers.\n",
      " Because budget airlines are more focused on tourists, every destination that Ryanair adds for example\n",
      " a popular destination, simply because it has become possible to get there\n",
      " cheap to go. Some traditional airlines in Europe start their own budget airlines\n",
      " to also make a profit in this way. Air France has established Transavia and Lufthansa started Eurowings.\n",
      " Both lose a lot of money. What they seem to forget is\n",
      " that the US has gone through this phase a few decades ago. Delta started Song,\n",
      " that failed. US Airways started MetroJet, which failed. United started Shuttle, which failed\n",
      " after which they were declared bankrupt and decided to try again with Ted, which also failed.\n",
      " None of these has worked! Traditional airlines can not negotiate their employment contracts,\n",
      " honest business and dedication to their hubs. The reason that Ryanair\n",
      " and EasyJet succeeded while others failed, especially because they are\n",
      " be big and flexible. They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands\n",
      " employees and a negotiating position that enables them to exceed their competitors.\n",
      " In the end, competition is good for us as customers. Even failing budget airlines\n",
      " reduce the costs of traditional airlines and enable us to fly the world more cheaply.\n",

      " The Cumberland Valley houses six villages that are between Hagerstown in Maryland and Harrisburg\n",
      " Pennsylvania - Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle and Mecanicsburg.\n",
      " What is so special about these small villages in Pennsylvania is that they are almost exactly\n",
      " 16 kilometers apart.\n",
      " The distances do not deviate more than one mile from this line.\n",
      " This is no coincidence and this is also not planned.\n",
      " If you draw equally large circles around the villages, you can see their influence circles.\n",
      " Assuming that every city has exactly the same stores and services, rational people will go\n",
      " to the village nearest to buy or sell their goods.\n",
      " When villages are sixteen kilometers apart, this means that no one has to travel more than 8 kilometers to get one\n",
      " reach the village.\n",
      " All these villages were founded before the United States was formed, what\n",
      " means that nobody had cars and everybody had to walk everywhere.\n",
      " 16 kilometers, or 5 kilometers there and back, is about the distance that one can travel well\n",
      " in one day with enough time to buy or sell goods on a central market.\n",
      " In this period before the car, a radius of 8 kilometers was in fact the greatest possible\n",
      " work traffic zone for small farming villages and therefore a distance of 16 kilometers was the most\n",
      " efficient way to use rural terrain.\n",
      " Take a look at the map of a rural environment that existed before the car.\n",
      " You will see that the distance between medium-sized villages is almost always somewhere between\n",
      " 16 and 24 kilometers.\n",
      " Because the Cumberland valley is a valley, villages could only develop in a line,\n",
      " but in most cases villages develop in all directions.\n",
      " This is what the 16-kilometer rule looks like when it goes in all directions.\n",
      " Each of these points is a village and the hexagon around it is the area from which people\n",
      " will come to the village.\n",
      " In the real world, each of these villages will have a small supermarket, just like a pharmacy, a bank\n",
      " and maybe a restaurant.\n",
      " Since everyone uses these services, not many people have to live in the circle of influence\n",
      " of these villages to continue to exist.\n",
      " But where do you place something that is more specialized, such as a car mechanic.\n",
      " People only have to go to an auto mechanic once in a while, so you need more people for it\n",
      " survival of a garage than for a supermarket.\n",
      " Some of these villages develop into larger villages with more people who take care of it\n",
      " the survival of more specialized shops and services.\n",
      " Bringing these larger villages closer together with specialized stores would be untenable,\n",
      " since not enough people would go to these stores. But place them further apart\n",
      " would again be inefficient because there is land from which people would not go to a city.\n",
      " This happens once or twice, until you have cities.\n",
      " These cities have the largest influence circles and the most specialized stores.\n",
      " Of course there are still supermarkets and pharmacies in cities, but there are also things\n",
      " as dealers of expensive cars, special hospitals and airports.\n",
      " The influence circle of a city is enormous, because people will travel hundreds of kilometers\n",
      " to buy an expensive car, to get a special treatment or to fly from an airport.\n",
      " Think about it in a city.\n",
      " How far would you walk to buy a latte?\n",
      " Probably only a few blocks and that is why you see a Starbucks or other coffee shop\n",
      " on almost every street corner.\n",
      " Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people for one\n",
      " to maintain a coffee shop.\n",
      " But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook?\n",
      " Probably quite far, since it is an incidental and sustainable purchase.\n",
      " That is why Apple Stores are rare, even in cities.\n",
      " You need a large amount of people to maintain an Apple Store and we can even roughly\n",
      " calculate how much that is there.\n",
      " In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 30 kilometers away from the Store in New Haven\n",
      " to the northeast and from the Store in Stamford to the southwest.\n",
      " In the radius of 16 kilometers around the Trumbull Apple Store there are about half a million\n",
      " residents, which tells us that you need about half a million people to have one Apple Store\n",
      " to maintain.\n",
      " We can compare that with the Starbucks stores in Manhattan, which are spread over one\n",
      " average distance of about 180 meters.\n",
      " A circle of 90 meters around a Starbucks in Manhatten contains about 6,000 people,\n",
      " which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to continue to exist.\n",
      " Of course both Connecticut and New York are places with an above-average income\n",
      " means fewer people are needed to maintain one Starbucks or Apple Store.\n",
      " The figures would be different in for example rural Kansas, but because every store generally\n",
      " allleen builds in areas with above-average income, this gives us a pretty good picture of how much\n",
      " people need Apple and Starbucks to open a store.\n",
      " Our model thus shows where cities should be, but that is not the way it looks.\n",
      " This is the most efficient distribution of cities, if you assume that the cities are on one\n",
      " perfectly smooth landscape are built, without geographical aspects, no social influences, more variety\n",
      " in income, even distribution of resources - in other words, assuming that the world is a homogenous place ...\n",
      " and it is not.\n",
      " In reality, our world has a huge impact on where and why cities develop.\n",
      " To begin with, let's take this model back to one city in a bare environment without resources.\n",
      " What most influences the location of cities is water.\n",
      " If we place an ocean next to our isotropic stretch of land, our city will almost certainly develop\n",
      " close to this ocean.\n",
      " Oceans still connect the world.\n",
      " There is no other way of transport to transport such large quantities of goods\n",
      " for so little money.\n",
      " Every city must be economically efficient to grow and it costs more for goods\n",
      " to a city that is 1,500 kilometers inland than to a city near the ocean.\n",
      " Just look at Europe.\n",
      " Six of the ten largest European cities are within 150 kilometers of the coast.\n",
      " But oceans are not the only forms of water that affect cities.\n",
      " Rivers have just as much - or perhaps even more - influence.\n",
      " Milan, the 18 th largest city in Europe, is the largest one that is not immediately on\n",
      " an ocean or river lies and then it is only 25 kilometers away from a river and 120 kilometers from\n",
      " the ocean.\n",
      " Until the last century, cities could not survive without direct access to water.\n",
      " If you need more evidence: 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen\n",
      " kilometers from the ocean.\n",
      " Perhaps the most logical attraction for cities is resources, so back to us isotropically\n",
      " land: we place raw materials somewhere on this map and sign cities in the neighborhood.\n",
      " Cities that existed for the past century arose close to resources,\n",
      " like Pittsburgh, since this city acted as producer and transporter for\n",
      " these means, but nowadays cities that depend on resources are no longer so close to\n",
      " the means itself to be established.\n",
      " New techniques of transport can supply the resources from their source.\n",
      " Just look at Dubai.\n",
      " Of course, the UAE have a huge supply of oil, but they are much closer to Abu Dhabi and\n",
      " the southwest than Dubai.\n",
      " In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 inhabitants, less than half of Carlisle in Pennsylvania - one\n",
      " from the farming villages we talked about at the beginning of this video.\n",
      " That only grew to 40,000 in 1960, but nowadays it is known worldwide and has more than it\n",

      " It was able to grow rapidly - even faster than Abu Dhabi - because it threw itself\n",
      " as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industry in the region.\n",
      " Another geographic aspect that we can add to the piece of land are mountains.\n",
      " Mountains do not always have the same effect on cities.\n",
      " Mexico City, Bogota and Addis Ababa are all three huge cities that are higher than\n",
      " 2,000 meters.\n",
      " Mountains make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection.\n",
      " Many cities from antiquity developed in these places because they were easy to protect ...\n",
      " and that provided more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also stand in the way of that development.\n",
      " For a time the United States could not develop anything west of the Appalachian mountains.\n",
      " These mountains were a huge obstacle.\n",
      " In 1800, the center of the population was here, despite\n",
      " that the US had sovereignty over this entire area.\n",
      " Ultimately, technology defeated this obstacle and could extend the population\n",
      " to what is now Missouri, but if the Appalachians had not existed,\n",
      " American history and geography had looked very different.\n",
      " We had seen urban developments much earlier in the mid-west.\n",
      " But mountains can also have a different effect.\n",
      " Coal, silver, gold and other minerals are often located in mountainous regions\n",
      " areas and, just like in Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable areas\n",
      " because of the resources.\n",
      " The economic benefit of exploiting the funds is stronger than the economic disadvantage\n",

      " Denver, Colorado grew by 650% between 1870 and 1880 thanks to the opening of a rail network\n",
      " connected to the transcontinental rail network.\n",
      " It served as an access point for transportation to gold mines in the Rocky Mountains.\n",
      " Mountains can therefore keep cities away, but also attract themselves - it really depends\n",
      " of the circumstances.\n",
      " Let's exchange our isotropic piece of land for a world map.\n",
      " What should the cities be on here?\n",
      " The cities of our world are not necessarily all located in the most geographically efficient location.\n",
      " Although there is a certain level of natural selection that allows the efficiently placed cities to grow\n",
      " and the inefficiently placed cities shrink, people are not always able to\n",

      " Let's get the 224 cities in the world that have a population of more than 2 million.\n",
      " You can immediately see some patterns.\n",
      " We put the equator on the map and you see a clear difference.\n",
      " Only 32 of these cities are in the southern hemisphere.\n",
      " One might think that this is because there is much more land in the northern hemisphere,\n",
      " but that is not entirely true.\n",
      " The southern hemisphere still has 32% of all the country in the world, but only 14%\n",
      " of the largest cities in the world.\n",
      " There is clearly a greater density of cities in the northern hemisphere.\n",
      " You can easily trace this back to Europe and Asia.\n",
      " The first great civilizations and dominions were on these two continents, although it\n",
      " human race probably originated in Africa.\n",
      " There are hundreds of different theories about why civilizations are successful in some places\n",
      " and do not succeed in other locations, but one of the more plausible and interesting explanations is that\n",
      " Europe and Asia were successful because they are broad, rather than high.\n",
      " The shape of the continents may have changed human history.\n",
      " When a continent is wide, you have a lot of land with roughly the same climate.\n",
      " A climate generally changes when you go north or south, not when you go east or west,\n",
      " because of the way the earth revolves around the sun.\n",
      " Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with growing plants,\n",
      " the breeding of animals and the associated technology.\n",
      " When you expand in width, the climate is sufficiently equal so that a rule is the same\n",
      " successful plants and animals can use, while expanding in height requires that new ones\n",
      " plants and animals are bred and bred.\n",
      " If a civilization started in central America, for example, there would be very little land\n",
      " on the continent with a similar climate and the expansion possibilities would be limited.\n",
      " In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there are thousands and thousands of kilometers with the same\n",
      " climate that can be achieved simply by traveling east or west.\n",
      " There is evidence to support this.\n",
      " Just look at the maps of the four greatest early empires - the Qing dynasty, the Abbasid-\n",
      " Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate and the Mongolian Empire.\n",
      " These were all in Eurasia and the horizontal spread.\n",
      " When some of the more modern empires expanded, there was already technology to do this sea.\n",
      " The three great modern empires were the British, Spanish and French empires - all of them\n",
      " coming from a similar climate.\n",
      " An important reason why America was able to be successful was because all agriculture came from Europe\n",
      " worked there too.\n",
      " In terms of climate technology, Europe and America are almost identical.\n",
      " The majority of developed colonized countries are in the Northern Hemisphere because\n",
      " these were closest to Europe, but former British countries like South Africa, Australia\n",
      " and New Zealand are all very developed and are located in the southern hemisphere.\n",
      " Their success at the expense of the more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also become partial\n",
      " attributed to their climate, which more closely matches that in Europe.\n",
      " Let's ask one more question.\n",
      " If our world had only one city, where would it be?\n",
      " If you take the average of the location of every person in the world, you will end up\n",
      " in the south of central Asia.\n",
      " That means that this entire region is the best place to live, but true\n",
      " exactly must our metropolis come?\n",
      " This region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia, so we already meet\n",
      " those two criteria.\n",
      " We want a spot within about 150 kilometers of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains\n",
      " rich in minerals - the only real best place for a city on earth is probably ...\n",
      " Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n",
      " Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to build a city\n",
      " than here.\n",
      " There is evidence to support this: Dhaka is between the third largest metropolis\n",
      " on earth, depending on how you define it and Bangladesh is except for 5\n",
      " the most densely populated country in the world - 161 million people live in an area that is about the size of\n",

      " Flying is expensive. Why is this? Most will say by the cost of fuel\n",
      " but that's not quite right. The Airbus A320Neo can carry 24,000 liters of fuel. That is\n",
      " as much as 376 Toyota Camry's that have been refueled. For every mile and a half that the A320 flies,\n",
      " it consumes 6 liters of kerosene. That amounts to a void kilometer per 4 liters. An A320\n",
      " can hardly fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Termal on those four liters\n",
      " fuel. To fly the 340 kilometers from New York to DC, the A320 needs 1200 liters of fuel.\n",
      " With that amount, our Toyota Camry can drive 49 times from New York to LA. But we also have to think\n",
      " that our Camry has only 5 seats. An A320 has 154. So, assuming the plane\n",
      " fully loaded, it has a fuel efficiency of 170 kilometers per four liters per person.\n",
      " That is amazing! According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, airlines pay an average of only $ 1.24.\n",
      " per four liters of fuel. So, you even use only $ 2.50 of fuel, flying from New York to DC,\n",
      " so why do these tickets cost more than $ 80 ?! Well, there is a lot more\n",
      " the ticket price then only determines fuel. Before we start I just want to say this\n",
      " are already gross estimates. Many of these prices will vary greatly over time and there will be\n",
      " certainly way in which airlines reduce these costs, but this gives you a general idea\n",
      " what really makes flying so expensive. The first thing we can add to the airline ticket\n",
      " are the costs of the crew. A pilot earns an average of $ 79,000 per year, which amounts to about $ 44 per flight hour.\n",
      " We have two pilots for a one-hour flight from New York to DC\n",
      " that's $ 88 for the pilots. A fully loaded A320 needs four flight attendants,\n",
      " each Ã  about $ 38 per hour, for a total of $ 152, representing the total cost of the crew\n",
      " $ 240 brings. So, with our 154 seats that comes down to about $ 1.50 per person in costs for the crew.\n",
      " Okay, now we're at $ 4. Then we have to pay for the airports.\n",
      " The JF Kennedy Airport in New York is asking for $ 6.33 per 500 kg plane that is taking off, and our A320\n",
      " weighs 86,000 kilos. That means we pay $ 1089 in JFK, or over $ 7 per person\n",
      " Dulles Airport does not show what its landing costs are, but we assume that it's about\n",
      " the same as the landing costs at JFK for our 86,000 kilos aircraft. These costs\n",
      " generally contain the costs of using gates, doormen and other facilities, and\n",
      " come down to $ 13.50 per person. Our total is now $ 17.50. Now comes the nice part - taxes.\n",
      " There is a long list of different taxes and they all vary per country,\n",
      " so for convenience we only deal with those for the US. The easiest load is the\n",
      " tax for domestic passenger transport at 7.5% of the ticket price. That money goes to the FAA.\n",
      " If you land or take off at an airport in the countryside, defined as \"an airport with less than 100,000\n",
      " landings / starts during the second consecutive calendar year and is either 1) not located within 120 km\n",
      " from another airport with 100,000+ takeoffs / landings per year, 2) receives essential aviation subsidies\n",
      " or 3) is not connected to another airport connected by \"a highway\", then they also add\n",
      " 7.5% more. That is obviously not applicable for both airports. The FAA also brings\n",
      " $ 4 for every flight within the US unless you fly to Hawaii or Alaska. Then they bring\n",
      " $ 8.70 in charge. The TSA then adds $ 5.60 in taxes, called the \"9/11 security tax\" that is used\n",
      " to pay for the increased security since 9/11. This is only for domestic flights.\n",
      " If we were to fly from New York to Paris we would also pay $ 17.70 as\n",
      " tax for international transport, $ 5.50 for customs costs, $ 5.00 for the\n",
      " \"Animal and plant health inspection\", $ 7.00 for Immigration and Naturalization supplement\n",
      " and $ 14 for the French Civil Aviation Tax. So, with all taxes and surcharges that apply\n",
      " for this short flight we are now at $ 33 in total. Let's not forget that planes\n",
      " expensive. Our A320 costs $ 170 million. The lifespan of aircraft is not really determined\n",
      " by the number of flight hours, it is determined by something we call \"flight cycles\",\n",
      " what the neat word is for one flight. It does not really matter how long it flies\n",
      " in its lifetime, which is how often it has been under pressure. This is\n",
      " because every time an aircraft has been under pressure micro cracks develop around the rivets\n",
      " connect the metal plates to form the hull. Regardless of whether the aircraft flies for 30 minutes\n",
      " or 9 o'clock, the wear and tear of the aircraft remains the same. This is why long-distance aircraft\n",
      " usually older. They only go through one flight cycle per day\n",
      " while small regional jets do 8 to 10. So, back to our A380. Our plane\n",
      " is actually a relatively sustainable aircraft. It can fly up to 60,000 cycles. If we are the\n",
      " dividing the total price of the aircraft by the maximum number of flight cycles, we arrive at $ 1783\n",
      " per flight required to pay the aircraft.\n",
      " Per person that comes down to $ 11.50. We are now at $ 44.50. To keep the plane safe,\n",
      " airlines also have to do regular maintenance. For a one-hour flight, a society must\n",
      " carry out maintenance at the cost of about $ 646 in working hours, $ 276 in parts, $ 603 in inspections and\n",
      " and another $ 596 on repairs to the engine. That is $ 2121 in total or $ 14 per passenger. We sit\n",
      " now at $ 58.50. We must also think of the part that is not flown.\n",
      " Every airline has a company that is a company and incurs costs in itself. They pay\n",
      " administrative staff, directors, software engineers, marketing staff, consultants,\n",
      " customer service staff, PR staff, cleaners, but also rent, benefits, travel costs,\n",
      " running costs and much more. It is difficult to put an exact amount on it and how much that costs\n",
      " per person, but we make a conservative estimate of $ 10. We are now at $ 68.50.\n",
      " OK, insurance. A company pays approximately $ 106,500 a year to insurance for an A320 and assuming that\n",
      " our plane is in the air 8 hours a day, this hour costs $ 36,\n",
      " or about 25 cents per person. So, our total amounts to $ 68.75.\n",
      " We round this off to $ 70 because we are a few small things that I have not treated\n",
      " such as hotel costs for the crew, aircraft storage, assistance, entitlement insurance, etc.\n",
      " That means that 10 $ of the plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that my estimates\n",
      " on the conservative side and that I assume that the device is completely full. Eventually it goes\n",
      " not a lot of money to society. Back to my first sentence \"Flying is expensive\".\n",
      " Well, actually it is not that expensive and it is also cheaper. To be able to fly in the magical iron bird over land\n",
      " from New York to LA in 6 hours costs about $ 340 return. In our very economical\n",
      " Toyota Camry to drive over land in 40 hours costs $ 340 alone\n",
      " to fuel and then an estimated $ 300 in maintenance and depreciation costs. In the\n",
      " last 30 years the ticket price for flying has dropped by 50% if you include the inflation, and the\n",
      " is still falling. In 1974 it was illegal to offer a flight between New York\n",
      " and LA ,. for less than $ 1442, including inflation, and now you can take these flights\n",
      " sometimes l find for less than $ 200 return. One of the reasons for this reduction\n",
      " in prices is the emergence of highly efficient aircraft. Some innovations such as plastic structures,\n",
      " better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and, perhaps most importantly, winglets, have the costs\n",
      " for flying significantly reduced. Here is the only real reason of \"Real Engineering\"\n",
      " explain the winglets.\n",
      " As you said, the aviation industry is constantly looking for ways to reduce the cost of their fuel consumption.\n",
      " In the early 1970s fuel prices rose explosively, and engineers were obliged to find new ways\n",
      " to make their aircraft more efficient. One of them was the winglets, those are those small ones\n",
      " curved pieces at the end of the wing. Let's see how they work quickly. Winglets were\n",
      " introduced to lower induced air resistance, which occurs when high pressure is under the wing\n",
      " overflows to the low pressure above it. This flow creates swirls\n",
      " the tips of the wings that create resistance and reduce the upward pressure, which in turn is the fuel efficiency\n",
      " of the plane. Winglets are there to reduce these eddies through the airflow over the\n",
      " edge of the wing. For a full explanation you have to look at the history of the winglets, go\n",
      " to my channel and watch my new video where a special guest is\n",

      " If you like this channel, I guarantee you will like it too. I leave you with\n",
      " the real reason why certain tickets are so expensive, but also a reason why they become cheaper - competition\n",
      " or the lack of it. The aviation industry is one with very little competition. Ticket prices\n",
      " from New York to LA are cheap because there is a lot of demand and there is relative\n",
      " lots of competition. Five different airlines fly directly from New York to LA, two\n",
      " of these are budget companies. People often do not care what society they fly with, they do\n",
      " find the price more important, so companies will try to match the prices of the budget airlines.\n",
      " Compare this with a route like Denver - Gunnison Country. Especially because only United\n",

      "And, so with that said, we need to talk about the shooting that happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.\n",
      "As of recording this video, 17 people have died, 14 have been injured.\n",
      "Of those 14, five have life-threatening injuries.\n",
      "It was among the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history.\n",
      "It is the worst school shooting since Sandy Hook.\n",
      "But, that said, let's talk about the timeline.\n",
      "The shooting reportedly happened just before 3:00 P.M. yesterday.\n",
      "Reportedly, started moments before the students were set to be dismissed.\n",
      "The gunman who if you're new here, whenever we talk about these kind of mass shootings, I don't show faces. I don't share names.\n",
      "I personally just don't want to promote that garbage. But, we should still discuss details so we can learn from this situation.\n",
      "So, with that said, reportedly the gunman was a 19-year-old former student of the school.\n",
      "He was armed with a semi-automatic AR-15 with what police are describing as, \"countless magazines.\"\n",
      "He first opened fire outside the school where he killed three people, one on a nearby street corner, two just outside the school.\n",
      "He then made his way inside where he opened fire on students, and teachers.\n",
      "Reportedly, a fire alarm went off right before the shots were heard inside the school.\n",
      "Investigators believe that he may have actually pulled the fire alarm so students would go out into the hallways.\n",
      "But, this hasn't been fully confirmed yet.\n",
      "Also, according to reports the school had actually had a fire drill earlier in the day so many people did go into the hallways thinking it was the same thing.\n",
      "Others stayed in their classrooms because they thought it was weird to have another drill in the same day.\n",
      "Several students posted videos of the gunfire inside the school others called, and texted loved ones.\n",
      "Also, on this note, and it is an aside, but I want to hit on it before we continue this conversation.\n",
      "To people like Mark Dice, who tweeted:\n",
      "\"Someone want to tell the Generation Z kids that in the event of a school shooting, they should call 911 instead of posting video of it on Snapchat. Parkland. Florida.\"\n",
      "100% go fuck yourself right in your stupid fucking face!!\n",
      "How dare you criticize the actions of fucking children in the midst of a school shooting!!\n",
      "As one student even responded:\n",
      "\"By the way as we were running for our lives we were calling 911 to the point that they told us not to anymore.\"\n",
      "Also, you don't know how you're gonna react in a moment like that.\n",
      "I had a student reach out to me via Twitter in a closet.\n",
      "When I responded, \"I said don't worry about anyone covering this story. Just make sure you're safe.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, other reporters are trying into that person's DM.\n",
      "After being evacuated, they then responded:\n",
      "\"I'm traumatized. I don't even remember tweeting you and I'm not sure why I did.\"\n",
      "And, so to Mark, and anyone that I had the same mindset of Mark, how about, how about you don't take a verbal shot at the kids that were actually shot at?!\n",
      "You're disgusting!!\n",
      "But, back to the main story. The shootings happening at 2:53 P.M. Broward County Sheriff's Office tweets:\n",
      "\"BSO is working a developing incident regarding a report of active shooters. Here's what we know so far:\n",
      "Deputies are responding to reports of a shooting at Stoneman Douglas High. There are reports of victims. PIO will be on scene 3:15 pm.\"\n",
      "As law enforcement arrives, they begin helping students flee the school. They start searching for the shooter.\n",
      "The shooter then reportedly fled the scene himself.\n",
      "He initially avoid the police detection by blending in with the other students who are running away.\n",
      "But, he luckily didn't get far, because police were able to identify the shooter using the school security cameras.\n",
      "And, this is just an hour after arriving on the scene, the police found the suspect a few miles away in a residential neighborhood.\n",
      "And, they end up arresting him without incident. The shooter so far has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\n",
      "And, as of recording this video, a judge's denied him bail.\n",
      "And, since this happened yesterday, we have now learned background information.\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, we learned the shooter used in AR-15, which now we know ATF has confirmed the shooter legally purchased this year, and passed the required background check.\n",
      "We also learned that the gunman had posted some disturbing images on social media, disturbing comments on Instagram, and YouTube.\n",
      "Also, specifically regarding the comments, reportedly the FBI had been made aware of threatening comments.\n",
      "This thanks to 36-year-old YouTuber, Ben Bennight.\n",
      "He reportedly alerted the FBI with a screenshot. He also called their Mississippi office.\n",
      "A comment which featured the shooter's name back in September reading:\n",
      "\"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\"\n",
      "According to Ben, they did an in-person interview with him the very next day, saying:\n",
      "\"They came to my office the next morning and asked me if I knew anything about the person.\"\n",
      "\"I didn't. They took a copy of the screenshot and that was the last I heard from them.\"\n",
      "And then, at a news conference this morning, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Rob Lasky, spoke about this:\n",
      "\"In 2017, the FBI received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel.\"\n",
      "\"The common comment simply said, 'I'm going to be a professional school shooter.'\"\n",
      "\"No other information was included with that comment, which would indicate a time, location for the true identity of the person who made the comment.\"\n",
      "\"The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment.\"\n",
      "Although, there has been criticism to the FBI's response there, because the YouTube comment literally had the shooter's name on it.\n",
      "It's also been reported by media, and a very important note here, not confirmed by law enforcement yet that the shooter left several other troubling comments, including:\n",
      "\"I wanna to shoot people with my AR-15.\"\n",
      "\"I want to die fighting killing shit ton of people.\"\n",
      "\"I'm going to kill law enforcement one day they go after the good people.\"\n",
      "As far as why the shooter was a former student, reportedly he was expelled from the high school for disciplinary reasons last year.\n",
      "That said there aren't confirmed details about the reason for his expulsion right now.\n",
      "We've also seen other students describing him as troubled with few friends.\n",
      "One student even saying:\n",
      "\"Honestly a lot of people were saying that it was going to be him, a lot of kids threw jokes around like that, saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out you know, everyone predicted it. That's crazy.\"\n",
      "We also learned today that the shooter was a member of a White Nationalist Organization.\n",
      "They're called, \"The Republic of Florida.\"\n",
      "They say they consider themselves, \"a white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics.\"\n",
      "Adding, \"The ultimate creation of a white ethnos state so we can be free from anti-white policies and have policies that reflect our values as white westerners.\"\n",
      "And, we know that, because a Captain for the Republic of Florida said:\n",
      "\"\"ROF hosted a \"paramilitary\" training session in the Tallahassee area that he attended.\"\"\n",
      "\"He probably used that training to do what he did yesterday.\"\n",
      "\"Nobody I know told him to do that. He just freaked out.\"\n",
      "Adding, \"I know he knew full well he was joining a white separatist paramilitary proto-fascist organization. I know he knew that much.\"\n",
      "And, following this situation, we're kind of seeing the, \"same gun reform dance,\" that we always see after something like this.\n",
      "Many people saying we need gun reform, and obviously here, it's varying levels.\n",
      "You've people who are calling for a full outright ban of all guns to people just talking about mental health, access things, like that.\n",
      "Right. And then, a lot of people in the middle of that range.\n",
      "Then, you have people on the other end of things saying more guns.\n",
      "That's what we actually need because when you create gun-free zones like a school, you're actually just creating a target.\n",
      "And then, finally, you have the third group which I personally I will just throw this out there just for transparency sake, I find the most infuriating.\n",
      "Tomi Lahren's of the world who say that it's too soon to talk about it.\n",
      "I saw one of her all-encompassing Tweets she put out yesterday, reading:\n",
      "\"Can the left let the families grieve for even 24 hours before they push their anti-gun and anti-gun owner agenda? My goodness. This isn't about a gun it's about another lunatic.\"\n",
      "Here's the thing a conversation of how do we make sure less people get murdered?!\n",
      "Less children are killed?!\n",
      "That we shouldn't be like, \"let's wait.\"\n",
      "Talk about how to prevent further death shouldn't be a partisan issue.\n",
      "One, for damn sure, the person that shot off this school was a dreamer, was an illegal immigrant, a refugee, 100% within 24 hours, Tomi Lahren would be sounding off.\n",
      "Which is why, two, I think that we need to have a conversation as fast as possible, no matter what.\n",
      "If someone shoots of a school, let's immediately talk about guns, and potential solutions.\n",
      "If an illegal immigrant, or refugee was the shooter, let's also talk about border security, and immigration policy.\n",
      "Let's say that illegal immigrant, or refugee didn't use a gun, maybe they ran people over with a van, then let's still talk about border security, and immigration policy.\n",
      "We should be talking about any, and all key aspects contributing factors that led to the death of innocence.\n",
      "Why are we picking, and choosing when murder matters?!\n",
      "And, I say this is someone that used to say the same thing that people I now find infuriating say, \"You know let's wait before we talk about this.\"\n",
      "No. Because it just keeps happening- and-happening-and-happening, and when we need to talk about solutions as fast as possible.\n",
      "Prevention is all about getting in front of something. The timing is incredibly important.\n",
      "And, as far as this section, I'm not saying what's right, and what's wrong, but we need to talk about solutions. That's my main point.\n",
      "But, where I want to close this story, is on people like Aaron Fies.\n",
      "Aaron was a football coach, and a security guard at the school. He reportedly stepped in front of students, and was shot shielding them from gunfire.\n",
      "He ended up being rushed to a hospital. He ended up dying there.\n",
      "A spokeswoman for the school saying, \"He died the same way -- he lived he put himself second.\"\n",
      "Also adding, \"He was a very kind soul, a very nice man. He died a hero.\"\n",
      "That's who I want to feature, and show, and name in this video, not that murdering trash bag.\n",
      "People like Aaron Feis. People like Scott Beagle. Other people's names are now coming through.\n",
      "Scott was the 35-year-old geography teacher.\n",
      "According to reports, while the shooter was active in the hallway, he unlocked the door to his room to get other students to safety.\n",
      "Unfortunately, before Scott was able to get back to the room, he was shot, and killed.\n",
      "Also, I think it's incredibly important, we think of, thank, and send lots of love to law enforcement, and first responders on the scene.\n",
      "And also, looking at the names, and pictures of the young kids that were killed.\n",
      "Because it's incredibly important to remember that this happened to real people.\n",
      "Stories like this they quickly become about numbers, statistics.\n",
      "He starts seeing spreadsheets, and you lose the human element.\n",
      "Children died. Adults died.\n",
      "And, every second, we don't talk about how to prevent the next one of theses happening?!\n",
      "Or, we're doing all of these people a disservice.\n",
      "But, that's where I'm gonna end the story in today's show. I do want to - I want to pass a question off to you.\n",
      "What is - What is your feeling around this?!\n",
      "I know. I know. I normally do though you know, \"subscribe, like thing.\" We don't need that today.\n",
      "If you've got people in your life today, if they're right there with you, give them a hug.\n",
      "Let them know you love them.\n",
      "If they're not with you, send them a text, give them a phone call, a FaceTime, or whatever.\n",
      "Just-Just love someone while you have them.\n",
      "The world is a stupid horrifying place where were you, or someone you love may not be here tomorrow.\n",
      "So, just-just love people while you have them.\n",
      "And, with that said, my name is Philip DeFranco. I love your faces, and I will see you tomorrow.\n",
      "Sup! You beautiful bastards.\n",
      "hope you're having a fantastic Monday\n",
      "February 19th, 2018. Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into it!\n",
      "And the first thing I wanna talk about today, one of the more requested stories of the day.\n",
      "Let's talk about this situation around LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Laura Ingraham.\n",
      "On February 15th LeBron James, Kevin Durant do an interview.\n",
      "It was a segment for a show called \"Uninterrupted\".\n",
      "it talked about things like President Trump\n",
      "the country, other social issues.\n",
      "and in that video interview, we see this:\n",
      "The number one job in America\n",
      "the point of person, is someone who doesn't understand the people.\n",
      "and really don't give a fuck about the people\n",
      "when we talkin' about leadership and what's goin' on in our country\n",
      "it's all about leadership\n",
      "and I learned that playing basketball, you know? I learned a lot of life skills from playing basketball\n",
      "you need that power of people, you need to, you know, encourage people, and that's what\n",
      "builds a great team and I feel like our team as a, as a country, is not ran by a great coach\n",
      "it's not even a surprise when he says somethin'\n",
      "it's not even surprise, it's like laughable, it's like-\n",
      "it's laughable\n",
      "and it's scary\n",
      "and in response to that, later that night, Fox news host Laura Ingraham criticized the players\n",
      "saying LeBron's comments were barely intelligible, they were ungrammatical, adding\n",
      "here's this barely intelligible, not to mention ungrammatical, take on president Trump\n",
      "in a new ESPN podcast\n",
      "I'm numb to this commentary, like\n",
      "must they run their mouths like that?\n",
      "unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take this ignorant comments seriously\n",
      "look, there might be a cautionary lesson\n",
      "in LeBron for kids\n",
      "this is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA\n",
      "and it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year\n",
      "to bounce a ball\n",
      "oh and LeBron and Kevin, you're great players, but no one voted for you\n",
      "millions elected Trump to be their coach\n",
      "so keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said\n",
      "shut up and dribble\n",
      "and following this we saw a lot of big reactions online\n",
      "some saying, yeah, Laura's right, stick to basketball\n",
      "don't talk about politics\n",
      "others saying no, these guys are just embracing their freedom of speech\n",
      "they're giving their opinion on something\n",
      "some going as far to say Ingraham's comments were racist\n",
      "we then saw Ingraham respond to those allegations of racism\n",
      "and ultimately her defense is I've told people to shut up and blank for years\n",
      "saying\n",
      "following this we saw LeBron responding over the weekend\n",
      "we will definitely not, uh, shut up and dribble\n",
      "I would definitely not do that, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to the, to the- to so many kids\n",
      "that feel like they don't have a, um, they don't have a way out\n",
      "and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they're in\n",
      "also, I wish she would've did a little bit more fact checking because I actually did\n",
      "finish high school and didn't leave early\n",
      "I graduated high school\n",
      "the best thing she did is gonna help me, is create more awareness\n",
      "and I get, I get to sit up here and talk about social injustice, equality, and why a woman on\n",
      "a certain network decided to tell me to shut up and, and dribble\n",
      "and as far as my personal response to this\n",
      "uh, uh, I, I'm not even gonna touch the, you know, the intention, was it racism, blah, blah, blah part\n",
      "but I do think Laura Ingraham's point is ridiculous as well as- considering that she is on Fox news\n",
      "and the guests they bring on Fox news, it's very hypocritical\n",
      "I'll hit specifics on that point in a second\n",
      "1: I think it's ridiculous to disqualify someone's opinion on something because of their job\n",
      "or the amount of money they make\n",
      "before Donald Trump was president, he said he had billions, we know that he had at least hundreds of millions of dollars\n",
      "yes he was a businessman, but he was also a reality TV star\n",
      "just because he wasn't elected at that time\n",
      "doesn't mean that Donald Trump's opinions and reactions on things should've been disqualified\n",
      "using your same argument, we could also say why should we care what Laura says\n",
      "she wasn't elected\n",
      "as far as the hypocritical point, I'll just piggy-back on what Chris Long pointed out\n",
      "Chris Long of course Eagles defensive end, two time Super Bowl champion\n",
      "you've also probably seen him pop up in the news this year because he donated his entire salary this year\n",
      "to charity\n",
      "he made a very long Twitter collage of all the times Fox news brought on celebrities to hear their opinion\n",
      "Jon Voight\n",
      "Kid Rock\n",
      "Chuck Norris\n",
      "Clint Eastwood\n",
      "and if you wanna take the time, the list goes on and on\n",
      "so why do their opinions seemingly matter, but when LeBron and Kevin talk\n",
      "no, you can play basketball\n",
      "so for Laura to have that opinion, I just feel like it's ridiculous\n",
      "but that said, of course I wanna pass the question off to you\n",
      "what are your thoughts on this?\n",
      "then let's talk about Black Panther for two reasons\n",
      "one, it is just killin' it at the box office right now\n",
      "it's estimated that it's going to make $201 million in North America over the weekend\n",
      "and internationally it's expected to make $387 million more\n",
      "ratings wise it's got 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with an audience score of 77%\n",
      "and I will say, I personally loved the movie, uh, it's a gorgeous looking movie, they, they somehow\n",
      "make me care about almost all the characters, even secondary characters\n",
      "and Michael B Jordan is a fantastic villain with a fantastic back story\n",
      "for me personally when it comes to these kind of movies, how good the movie is often depends on\n",
      "the bad guy\n",
      "like some comic book movies can power through not having a really good bad guy\n",
      "like Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel like it's had a bad guy problem\n",
      "but you just watch the first movie, it's just so fun, like the, the main five are so great\n",
      "and with Black Panther, Michael B Jordan just kills it at being Kill Monger\n",
      "that said, I can understand people's criticisms about certain things\n",
      "like the green screen\n",
      "some, some pacing issues depending on your personal preference\n",
      "predictability, but then you could argue it's about the ride\n",
      "so there's that side of it, but then there was also the fake news side of it\n",
      "over the last few days, some social media users have claimed that they were attacked while going to screenings\n",
      "of Black Panther\n",
      "and these people claim the attacks were racially motivated\n",
      "most of the photos include photos of people bruised, bloody, after these alleged beatings\n",
      "we'll take a look at some of the tweets\n",
      "for example\n",
      "and there are more and more posts\n",
      "but you get the example\n",
      "that said, if you, if you are familiar with the Rob Porter story that we talked about\n",
      "uh, you know that was Rob Porter's wife in one of those pictures\n",
      "or if you're a fan of Supernatural, you know that this is Jenson Akles\n",
      "and some of the other photos included real photos from other assaults\n",
      "this particular one happened in Sweeden about a month ago\n",
      "and Twitter's tried to stop the spread of all these false reports\n",
      "they've suspended some of the accounts\n",
      "but if you go online right now, there's still people spreading this fake news\n",
      "and while this is disgusting to me because people are spreading fake news to further the racial divides\n",
      "in this country\n",
      "it's also extremely disrespectful and disgusting because they're using real victims\n",
      "people's horrible moments being exploited to push a racist agenda\n",
      "and that's the end of this story, I just wanted to make people aware\n"

      "what do we do with the biggest pusher of violence, the biggest pusher of violence is hands down\n",

      "so we had that version of the president on Twitter over the weekend, and then this morning\n",

      "it actually passed the House last year\n",
      "it's currently in the Senate\n",

      " Here's an interesting question: Paris, France and New York, USA\n",
      " Which city do you think the population is more dense?\n",
      " The answer may seem obvious: New York, skyscraper kingdom, Big Apple ... right?\n",
      " error.\n",
      " In fact, New York's population density is less than half that of Paris.\n",
      " Paris lives 56,000 people per square mile (22,000 per square kilometer)\n",
      " New York City, with only 27,000 people per square mile (10500 square kilometers per square kilometer)\n",
      " To find a comparable European city with New York (the most densely populated city in the United States)\n",
      " You have to see the sixth in Europe: Lyon, France\n",
      " (27 000 per square meter / mile; 10500 per square kilometer.)\n",
      " Of course, New York has a super dense metropolitan core, but it is surrounded by an endless stretch of suburbs,\n",
      " Just like almost any other American city.\n",
      " On the other hand, virtually all of Paris's population is concentrated in the center of a compact city\n",
      " There is another interesting pattern between the two continents:\n",
      " In the United States, the affluent lives in cities, while affluent Europeans live in the city center.\n",
      " Compare the income maps for Paris and Philadelphia.\n",
      " Of course, this is a bit rough, but you can really see such a pattern,\n",
      " The most commonly cited reason for these two different trends is the difference in urban age.\n",
      " Most European cities have existed for hundreds or even thousands of years,\n",
      " While some American cities have reached the size of what can be called the city's population,\n",
      " However, the past one or two hundred years.\n",
      " This also means that in those times when the super-rich must commute by foot,\n",
      " European cities already exist.\n",
      " In the Middle Ages, Paris had between 20 and 300,000 people,\n",
      " But you can still walk from one end of the city to the other within 30 minutes,\n",
      " The population is incredibly dense.\n",
      " At that time, people must live within walking distance,\n",

      " Walking distance is not only important in big cities,\n",
      " Small villages in Europe are almost always the same size,\n",
      " This is because their population is determined by the extent to which their surroundings can be reached by foot\n",
      " European farmers tend to live in small towns and walk to their fields for work,\n",
      " This is different from the situation in which American peasants generally hold a manor.\n",
      " So here's the village\n",
      " It will only be as large as people can walk to the field only by foot.\n",
      " On the other hand, in the more modern era, the decentralized technology has become more advanced,\n",
      " American cities have also started their rapid growth period.\n",

      " Interestingly, because the steam train takes a long time to accelerate,\n",
      " As a commune for the rich people to use the town, which is called the suburbs of the railway,\n",
      " It is not usually the nearest village, but a few miles from the city.\n",
      " The impact of the suburbs of the railway still exists today,\n",
      " In the old Philadelphia Railway, there is a rich community extension.\n",
      " From Ardmore to Malvern, there are huge manor and country clubs.\n",
      " There has been no change in the demographics since the suburbs of the railway.\n",

      " But again, walking distance affects geography,\n",

      " At this time the technology has allowed people to produce middle-class car can afford.\n",
      " By 1950, more than 50% of families owned cars.\n",
      " In the meantime, the government provided loans to veterans,\n",
      " This has significantly increased the population that the United States can afford to buy.\n",
      " Instead of buying a small downtown real estate, this generation chose to use their new car commute\n",
      " In order to live in the suburbs, cheaper and better bigger house.\n",
      " The idea was that working parents would go to urban areas every day,\n",
      " The rest of the family will stay to enjoy the suburbs.\n",

      " Crime may be the least cited reason for suburbanization in the United States.\n",
      " We sometimes forget, but this is a somewhat uglier period in American history\n",
      " The crime rate was crazy in the 70s, 80s and 90s.\n",
      " There are innumerable different theories to explain this, but perhaps the most interesting one is\n",
      " Higher leaded car exhaust contributes to lower IQ and higher aggression.\n",
      " In 1990, New York reached as many as 2,245 astronomical murders,\n",
      " London did not have as much in the entire 1990s.\n",

      " In 1992, a poll asked people moving out of New York why they were moving to the suburbs.\n",
      " The most common reason cited is \"crime\", reaching 47%.\n",
      " \"Cost and quality of life\" is as low as 10%.\n",
      " Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.\n",
      " Crime rates have dropped significantly in the suburbs, as they are often used as sanctuaries for high-income people.\n",
      " Europeans do not need to worry too much about such crimes in cities,\n",

      " The land on the American suburbs is also more readily available,\n",
      " Because farmers are always quick to sell their relatively unprofitable land to developers.\n",
      " In contrast, France's agricultural subsidies per acre\n",
      " 12 times higher than the United States.\n",
      " This is one of the big reasons why a large number of European cities are still surrounded by small farms.\n",

      " It is significantly more expensive to commute by car in Europe, so Europeans have a higher incentive to live closer to the office,\n",
      " Well, driving a short time, you can take the public transport.\n",
      " In addition, in Europe, electricity and heating costs are higher\n",
      " Large suburban homes are usually not attractive.\n",

      "Now since the end of apartheid, South Africa has only elected ANC members and many have had scandals,\n",
      "but not quite like Zuma. Aside from the 2005 fraud charges, there were a bunch of other charges and allegations. In 2006,\n",
      "he was charged and eventually acquitted of raping a family friend. During his presidency, the state Ombudsman said that 20 million dollars in security upgrades\n",
      "to his home were excessive and obscene. There's also been\n",

      "And actually just this, week police raided their residence, which actually led to concerns that there was more damning evidence\n",
      "that would be popping up soon against Zuma.\n",
      "But actually, one of the biggest things to happen came in October of 2017\n",

      " And that is why I am going to click on a new link\n",
      " and you learn a bit more about our amazing world.\n",
      " Today we are going to make a trip.\n",
      " We are going to escape the stiff boundaries of the earth.\n",
      " Up to the heavens.\n",
      " We travel through the galaxy.\n",
      " To learn about keeping time, on the red planet.\n",
      " Mars.\n",
      " But before we can keep track of the time on Mars,\n",
      " we must first understand how we keep time on the earth.\n",
      " Damn. Ehm. Can we ... can we turn this thing around?\n",
      " OK. So this is the Greenwich Observatory, in England.\n",
      " Greenwich is known as the place where the prime meridian lies.\n",
      " For clarity, this is the middle of the earth in length.\n",
      " For the sake of clarity we say that time is determined on the basis of the sun.\n",
      " However, this is not entirely true, so I have another video in which time is explained in more detail.\n",
      " When the sun is at its highest in the air at a random location, we call it 12:00 in the afternoon.\n",
      " And the time during the rest of the day is relative to this.\n",
      " So let's go south now, to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.\n",
      " We are in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.\n",
      " Just as the prime meridian is the middle of the earth in length,\n",
      " the equator is the center of the earth in width.\n",
      " At this point of 0 Â° length and 0 Â° width,\n",
      " It is 12:00, because the sun is at its highest point in the air.\n",
      " Beautiful. When we go 1000 Â° to the east,\n",
      " we are in the nice village of Etoumbi, in the Republic of Congo.\n",
      " In Etoumbi it is 13:00 in the afternoon,\n",
      " because the sun was here at its highest point an hour ago.\n",
      " This is why we have time zones.\n",
      " Since the earth revolves every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.\n",
      " But wait a minute, I lied. The earth does not do 24 hours to do a round,\n",
      " That is because there are actually two definitions of 'one day'.\n",
      " The usual definition is a solar day.\n",
      " That is the time between 12:00 noon, when the sun is at its highest in the air.\n",
      " The more scientific definition is a star day.\n",
      " That is the time it takes the earth to turn 360 Â° around its axis\n",
      " and therefore also the time it takes for a star to appear in the same place\n",
      " between one and the other day.\n",
      " There is a difference between star days and sunny days\n",
      " because the earth revolves around its own axis and around the sun.\n",
      " So, look at this.\n",
      " Let's put a point on a spot on the earth and flush a star day.\n",
      " You will see that the same point is not the closest yet\n",
      " is in the sun because the earth also revolves around the sun.\n",
      " To bring the point as close as possible to the sun,\n",
      " we have to go 4 minutes ahead and now one solar day has passed.\n",
      " Those 4 minutes count perfectly up to about 24 hours, spread over a year.\n",
      " This means that a star day is more than solar days per year.\n",
      " Okay, now we can go to Mars.\n",
      " That was quick.\n",
      " Mars is a planet that looks quite like the earth and time works in a similar way.\n",
      " It has a prime meridian ... here.\n",
      " Strangely enough, astronomers chose this prime meridian before it was chosen from the earth.\n",
      " According to the same principle as the Greenwich Mean Time,\n",
      " there is a coordinated Mars time called MTC.\n",
      " But in general, robot cars use Mars\n",
      " just the time of the place where they land.\n",
      " This is almost the same as how places on earth\n",
      " determined their time before coordinated time zones existed.\n",
      " Each place on earth determined the time with the highest position of the sun as 12:00 in the afternoon.\n",
      " However, this became difficult when ways were found to travel quickly between places,\n",
      " since nobody knew more then what time it was.\n",
      " If you want to know more about this, you can view my other video over time.\n",
      " Since there have only been 11 operational spacecraft on Mars,\n",
      " the use of times based on the sun has never caused problems.\n",
      " That means, however, that even the seconds are not coordinated between the different robot cars.\n",
      " What is a little tricky is that a day on Mars takes a little longer than a day on earth.\n",
      " Everyone who has watched The Martian, knows that a solar day on Mars is called a Sol.\n",
      " Robot trucks on Mars generally work only during the day,\n",
      " partly because some work on solar energy\n",
      " and partly because a lot of work is carried through cameras and enough light is needed.\n",
      " That is why the teams that run the robot cars on Mars from the earth live\n",
      " based on time on Mars.\n",
      " Their shifts shift every day for 40 minutes to coordinate it\n",
      " with the time that it is light on Mars.\n",
      " Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n",
      " who has worked on the Spirit and Opportunity programs, says that\n",
      " scientists who work with robot trucks sometimes have two watches,\n",
      " one for the time on Mars and one for the time on earth.\n",
      " So when we go to Mars we have to create time zones and use the coordinated time.\n",
      " Having different time standards in different places always causes problems,\n",
      " especially for computers and communication.\n",
      " This is of course only one of the many details that we need to figure out before we start living on the red planet.\n",

      " I have just interviewed the President of the United States of America\n",
      " It really is strange to me because I'm not a journalist\n",
      " I'm not a politician, I'm a rocket engineer\n",
      " I will, however, take a different view from the rest of the people\n",
      " The interview with the president is something different because you learn a lot about it\n",
      " The White House is also definitely, but you learn things about yourself as well\n",
      " The video will contain 4 paragraphs\n",
      " 1. How it happened. 2. What were my goals from this interview\n",
      " 3. The interview is complete. 4. And what is declared of it.\n",
      " What I understood is that there were many candidates to meet the president\n",
      " At one point, it became one of the candidates most likely to do so\n",
      " I did not register on the basis of liberal or democratic, and the question was asked: for the benefit of the voice\n",
      " And I did not answer\n",
      " But the way I answered it made it clear to me\n",
      " I will not be selected for the interview\n",
      " And it happened the opposite and I chose\n",
      " It was a secret for 3 weeks and then went to Los Angeles to film an interview.\n",
      " There she met Adnold and Ingrid\n",
      " They were very fun and humble too\n",
      " When I returned home I asked suggestions about the questions I should ask on the Internet\n",
      " I received all kinds of answers\n",
      " I mean good and bad too. It was fun\n",
      " But think about it, I do not agree with the president on all issues\n",
      " So I learned it was a great opportunity in front of me\n",
      " I was able to sit down with the most powerful man in the world and tell him how to run the country in my view\n",
      " Or I would accept that he sees things differently than I think\n",
      " And to try a deep, intelligent and respectful interview.\n",
      " My goal was not only a smart and respectable interview\n",
      " With someone I may not share my opinion on some topics\n",
      " But I was hoping to prove that it would be fun.\n",
      " For that, I went to Washington where I met the president.\n",
      " Yesterday the meeting, we went to the studio\n",
      " In Maryland, we trained on it with Frederic\n",
      " He's a Google employee, a very funny man.\n",
      " The next day, we went to the White House and we met a dog president\n",
      " Which was in fact very soft.\n",
      " We have settings and make sure we move correctly what we need\n",
      " Each of us went to a corner to review the questions for the last time\n",
      " To make sure we adjust what we say.\n",
      " Then the President waited for us to come and we started the interview\n",
      " The president had told us who we were\n",
      " Susie would give him a light about the interview,\n",
      " And then I was watching him with a video\n",
      " Then Ingrid would ask him what was in his pocket.\n",
      " Many people wanted to know, once I read these, cards\n",
      " In the White House, these cards are available, before the interview.\n",
      " The answer is: no.\n",
      " What I did is\n",
      " I looked him in the eye all the time\n",
      " This was evident, through his physical expression\n",
      " That makes him comfortable\n",
      " That impressed me. When I was aware of it\n",
      " I said to myself: Yahah, a citizen who came back to the White House\n",
      " In an interview with the world's most powerful man,\n",
      " In an interview on live broadcast\n",
      " This is very transparent.\n",
      " I do not care what you say about the man's policy,\n",
      " But that impressed me, and I liked it a lot.\n",
      " For several reasons, I was not nervous, really\n",
      " I was so excited about it.\n",
      " I decided to ask questions first\n",
      " On how to develop his intelligence in areas that may not be his specialty.\n",
      " The answer was important, because it is clear\n",
      " Has changed its means throughout the presidency.\n",
      " While he was answering, it was clear to me that he was in a traditional position to meet\n",
      " His body was untouchable\n",
      " Remember that until now the president is not aware of the quality of the interrogators I am.\n",
      " For information, I could have been tough.\n",
      " What happened next is something I will never forget\n",
      " I learned that we were on the same wave,\n",
      " I really wanted to make it clear to him,\n",
      " He listened to him for 10 hours through recorded books.\n",
      " Note the face of the President,\n",
      " You will see the moment when we were contacted.\n",
      " Opama: I think it's compatible with,\n",
      " You are aware of this, the approach of scientists to address problems in general.\n",
      " Destin: Actually I've listened to your recorded books\n",
      " And in \"my father's dreams,\"\n",
      " He concluded by addressing the National Democratic Convention of 2004.\n",
      " Did you see that? Let's go back and take a look at the language of his body.\n",
      " He was discreet, and then the call happened.\n",
      " Is not that great?\n",
      " It was the moment when she was really interviewed\n",
      " It became fun and smart\n",
      " Between two people who want each one for the better one.\n",
      " It was a wonderful moment, and I will never forget it.\n",
      " My second question was about polarization.\n",
      " It was clear to me that the country knows two poles very much about what it was before,\n",
      " In fact, there are data to make sure.\n",
      " Whatever your point of view, it has become very common to make fun of\n",
      " From the other side and to blame him for all the country's problems.\n",
      " The president explained why this is growing.\n",
      " Obama: The problem is that, when we return to our policy,\n",
      " Whatever the reason,\n",
      " This is largely related, as you know, to the media\n",
      " Some people only watch Fox News\n",
      " Others do not, only read the New York Times,\n",
      " And so they are not starting from the common points between them.\n",
      " They take two positions in their view of the world only.\n",
      " Dastin: In the field of theoretical enmity, there are so-called \"magnifying results\"\n",
      " There is what is positive and what is negative views.\n",
      " If you remove the negative from any two systems, the discrimination will occur and create chaos.\n",
      " This is not the science of politics, this of mathematics.\n",
      " When people listen, from right or left, to the media that pleases them only\n",
      " This is dangerous.\n",
      " There are no negative responses that bring you back to the moderate middle, and this will lead to extremism.\n",
      " I liked what the President said on this point,\n",
      " Because it is the responsibility of each of the parties in the political dialogue\n",
      " To listen to the arguments of the other.\n",
      " Otherwise, you will be in the echo room, and you will only hear those sounds\n",
      " That inflated, what, you want to hear, and then a little will only remain a controversy.\n",
      " My third question was about space, where the president shook hands,\n",
      " I forgot to be a respected and respected gentleman.\n",
      " On the whole, you can see in my face how excited you are to this question\n",
      " I would like the viewer to listen to the President's answer.\n",
      " I wanted to end this with a funny observation, so I asked him this interesting question from Reddit:\n",
      " Destin: If there is something to be called after you, opium\n",
      " I hope that this is the first time that you have been asked this question.\n",
      " OBAMA: I never got that question.\n",
      " Destin: Excellent\n",
      " the question is:\n",
      " Obama: This is the first time.\n",
      " Destin: So what do you want this tool to be\n",
      " Obama: What is the tool ..... What will be ....\n",
      " Destin: The tool is an opium.\n",
      " OBAMA: The question is, what will be the affairs of Obama?\n",
      " Destin: That's true\n",
      " Obama: That's important\n",
      " Dosten: I will not show all his answers now, and I encourage you to see the whole interview\n",
      " You will find it full in the White House Channel. White's House Channel.\n",
      " It is time to talk about what you have learned from this experience.\n",
      " The exercise of thinking about questions to ask the most powerful man in the world\n",
      " It's different from being at home or chatting with your friends\n",
      " And planning to go and sit, and look into his eyes\n",
      " And ask questions.\n",
      " I united myself I would like to know more,\n",
      " More mutual and more compassionate.\n",
      " Why? Why do we tend to be disrespectful?\n",
      " These two things are what I have learned from the president's interview on how to communicate with people\n",
      " May differ from them.\n",
      " No. 1. If you write or chat with someone in your phone,\n",
      " I will say that I sit with that person, and look at them in the right,\n",
      " Because I want to be respectful and tolerant.\n",
      " # 2: If you can listen, that's great!\n",
      " Think about it, if I listen, not just ride my answer to show that I'm smart,\n",
      " But if he really listened to contact with them from heart to heart,\n",
      " My credibility and the extent of my influence on that person will increase!\n",
      " Even if he was the most powerful man in the world, think about it.\n",
      " Respect and listen.\n",
      " It's really simple.\n",

      "And the first thing I want to talk about today is actually a story about a person I used to include in my thumbnails as clickbait, Kate Upton was in the news.\n",
      "You may have seen on January 31st, Kate Upton alluded to fashion brand Guess' co-founder Paul Marciano assaulting her.\n",
      "She tweeted out, \"It's disappointing that such an iconic women's brand Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director,\n",
      "hashtag Me Too.\" Also posting an image of her tweet on her Instagram with the caption,\n",
      "\"He shouldn't be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women, hashtag Me Too.\"\n",
      "Now Upton didn't immediately elaborate on what happened but\n",
      "her statement had an immediate effect on the fashion brand. Within hours of her initial tweet, Guess' shares dropped by more than 17 percent.\n",
      "Now, obviously keep in mind this happened during that dip in the stock market, but 17 percent is a whole lot more than 4 percent.\n",
      "Marciano has responded to Upton's post, giving TMZ a one-page statement\n",
      "Saying he never touched up dinner was alone with her\n",
      "And that he has built a brand with a quote \"long, and proud history of empowering women\", also noting Upton's timing her,\n",
      "saying, \"She leveled this malicious and false accusation only hours before a gala event at our headquarters in Los Angeles unveiling a new guest campaign.\"\n",
      "Also, saying he felt Upton statements provided no facts, no details, no dates, and no circumstances to corroborate her allegations.\n",
      "So then yesterday Upton provides details, dates, circumstances, and witnesses in a Time article\n",
      "Upton says that on the first day of her lingerie issue with Guess, Marciano forcibly grabbed her breasts.\n",
      "He kissed her against her will, he grabbed her thighs and arms to pull closer so he could smell her.\n",
      "He also allegedly told photographer Yu Tsai to leave the room so he could, be alone with Upton. Tsai has also corroborated Upton's story.\n",
      "Following that, she said, \"Then Paul insisted that he walk me up to my hotel room. I immediately declined.\"\n",
      "\"The only thing I was thinking is 'If he touches me like that in public, I can't imagine what he tried to do in private'.\"\n",
      "\"Thankfully, Yu Tsai stepped in and insisted he do it.\"\n",
      "\"I was so relieved and I felt like I had barely escaped.\"\n",
      "And following all of this, Kate said the harassment assault made her reconsider her career saying,\n",
      "\"It took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth. I wanted to quit modeling. I constantly blamed myself after it happened.\n",
      "What am i doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that? I wondered if it was how i was presenting myself or what i was wearing.\n",
      "I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size, wearing baggy, clothes, started despising my own body.\"\n",
      "But then calling on the industry to change, saying,\n",
      "\"The culture of complacency and tolerance in our industry needs to stop.\n",
      "People know what is going on and have previously accepted it and we can't always require the victims to be the ones\n",
      "to speak up and tell their story, because the victims only know their one story.\"\n",
      "And as far as where we are now, before Upton's Time interview,\n",
      "Guess said that they, would launch an investigation if she provided concerns that were determined to have merit.\n",
      "And so most likely what we're about to see is an investigation.\n",
      "Then let's talk about the failing New, York Times. The New York Times, who you may have heard are failing.\n",
      "I don't know if you've heard about this, people are saying it.\n",
      "Well the company came out with an announcement today and it really shows the big shift in news media.\n",
      "The company announced today that in 2017, they brought in 1.7 billion dollars and that's also a big deal for a few reasons:\n",
      "one, as a total that is an eight percent increase from 2016,\n",
      "two, a huge part of this is due to a surge in the number of people subscribing to their digital-only content,\n",
      "and three, thanks to an increase in digital advertising\n",
      "Subscriptions now reportedly account for 60% of their revenue; just in the last quarter 157,000 digital-only subscriptions were added.\n",
      "But also if there's something that kind of brings this story back down to earth let's talk\n",
      "About profit as reportedly operating profit dropped, from fifty six million for the quarter to twenty three million this they\n",
      "Say reportedly due to pension settlement charges and higher operating costs as\n",
      "Well as just on the print side a lot of their numbers drop but really all this story shows\n",
      "Is what most millennials and younger know?\n",
      "And that is the future is digit, also in this current climate people care\n",
      "About news, more than ever i used to joke about in the past but one of the biggest things to come\n",
      "From the trump administration and the election in general is that people care about, new\n",
      "Seven-days-a-week used to die over the weekend and for me the only question is do we get to a point\n",
      "Where print media in general\n",
      "dies out and it goes all digit or will there be\n",
      "Holdouts - there's reading an actual physical copy of a newspaper become a gimmick in the future i don't know\n",

      "Jones, now before you just take, that headline you start saying see all republicans are nazis, this situations a little complicated\n",

      "Well it's because he's running in a district where democrats have a lock on the seat democrats have, won the seat every election since\n",
      "1975 the last time a republican ran, which, was back in 2014 democrat won 64 percent to 35 percent so essentially what happened\n",
      "Is that a republican, was not going to run, and then arthur, jones just said\n",

      "It's with all of that said I do want to pass a question off to you\n",
      "What is your takeaway from this story?\n",
      "It is from last week to this week the story has seemingly evolved from this is a story about domestic abuse\n",
      "This is the story about a potential cover-up and people in the White House lying to the public and that's where I'm going to end\n",

      "but then because of the sake of time we didn't get to film it. So with that said, let's just jump into it.\n",
      "And the first thing we're going to talk about today is something that I feel proves that we are in one of the weirder\n",
      "timelines and that is because we are getting news about the White House from a reality TV show called\n",
      "Celebrity Big Brother. And this situation revolves around our Omarosa Manigault-Newman.\n",
      "Most who know about her call her Omarosa, she was on The Apprentice several times which of course was Donald Trump's reality show.\n",
      "Then, during the election, she was involved with Donald Trump again.\n",
      "During the RNC she said she had been named director of African-American outreach for their campaign\n",
      "In December of 2016, she was named as one of nine people on Donald Trump's transition team.\n",
      "Then in early 2017, she was brought on to be part of Trump's White House staff.\n",
      "And her specific title ended up being assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of public liaison.\n",
      "But that was then and this is now and we're living in a post Omarosa White House.\n",
      "In December of last year it was announced that she was \"resigning\". There are a lot of reports that said otherwise but sure.\n",
      "And now we are in February and Omarosa has now come back to reality TV, but this time on Celebrity Big Brother.\n",
      "It's the first time they're doing it in the States and Omarosa has already made national headlines.\n",
      "So if you're not familiar with the show consider yourself lucky. I am for some reason addicted to Big Brother.\n",
      "I don't know why. I don't care about these people once the show is over.\n",
      "I mean they're watching the live feeds most season for some reason. And whoever's in the house is being filmed at all times.\n",
      "There's cameras everywhere. And so this conversation between Omarosa and Ross Matthews gets filmed and Big Brother then just puts it out.\n",
      "He's talking about her time at the White House and she says this,\n",
      "\" 'I felt like it was like a call to duty, I felt like I was serving my country, not serving him.\n",
      "Whenever was it-- I'm accepting a political appointment, it was always about the country.\n",
      "Like I was haunted by tweets every single day, like what does he go to tweet next.'\n",
      "'Does anybody say to him,\n",
      "what are you doing?'\n",
      "'And I tried to be that person and then all the people around him attacked me. It was like 'keep her away from him,\n",
      "don't give her access, don't let her talk to him'.\n",
      "It's not my circus, not my monkeys.\n",
      "You know I'd like to say about my problem, but I can't say that because\n",
      "like it's bad.'\n",
      "'Should we be worried?'\n",
      "'Don't say that...'\n",
      "'Cuz we are worried, but I need you to say no it's gonna be okay.' 'No. It's gonna not be okay'\n",
      "'It's not.'\n",
      "'It's so bad.' \"\n",
      "And so there were two main reactions to this;\n",
      "one being 'Holy shit, this is terrifying!'\n",
      "and the other being 'This is just Omarosa putting on a show. She's angry at the White House for kicking her out.\n",
      "She wants people to buy her book. This, this is just a show.'\n",
      "Then in response to this and a question about the White House's reaction\n",
      "to what Omarosa said, deputy press secretary Raj Shah said this,\n",
      "\"What is the White House's reaction to comments made by former White House aide Omarosa on Celebrity Big Brother where she said quote\n",
      "'She is haunted by the president's tweets'. She described the situation inside the White House as bad and said it is not going to be okay\n",
      "Not very seriously. Omarosa was fired three times on The Apprentice, and this is the fourth time we let her go\n",
      "She had limited contact with the president while here. She has no contact now.\"\n",
      "So, one they're dismissing what she's saying\n",
      "and two, now they're being very straightforward and saying that she was fired.\n",
      "And as far as where the situation is right now because she doesn't have\n",
      "documentation, the people that want to believe it are gonna believe it, the people they don't want to believe it, they're not going to.\n",
      "And my personal reaction to this is I don't know what to believe because the source of this\n",
      "information the source of this story is Omarosa. She's a reality TV star veteran that knows how to use the platform,\n",
      "she knew that there were cameras on, her first jump was to go back into reality television\n",
      "where cameras were on at all points where she could whisper things that she wanted to get attention.\n",
      "So this kind of news coming out in a whisper conversation, that's going to have a big impact.\n",
      "Promo and strategy aside, that doesn't mean necessarily that she's lying about what's coming out of her mouth.\n",
      "Now does that guarantee that everything coming in our mouth is a lie, no\n",
      "but it does make me skeptical. But I will say it is kind of funny that she's putting herself in this position now\n",
      "considering what she said back in 2016 which if you do not remember. I shall read.\n",
      "\"It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get into the White House, we know where we stand.\"\n",
      "She then alluded to there being a list of enemies adding,\n",
      "\"Every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump.\"\n",
      "\"It's everyone who has ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him.\"\n",
      "\"It's the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.\"\n",
      "But with that said I do want to pass the question off to you\n",
      "What is your takeaway from this whole situation? Lying, telling the truth?\n",
      "I'd love to know your thoughts.\n",
      "But that also wasn't the only story about White House staffers we had in today's news because there was Rob Porter.\n",
      "Rob Porter is an, as of this week, former senior White House staffer. Specifically he was the White House staff secretary\n",
      "which meant that he was essentially the gatekeeper for the papers on their way to the president.\n",
      "And porter became an international story this week because his first and second ex-wives came out with stories that he abused them.\n",
      "The first article we saw was from his second ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby.\n",
      "And interestingly enough before describing the abuse that she received she says,\n",
      "\"I want to be very clear when I say this.\"\n",
      "\"I don't want to be married to him. I would not recommend anyone to date him or marry him.\"\n",
      "\"But I definitely want him in the White House in the position he is in.\"\n",
      "\"I think his integrity and ability to do his job is impeccable.\"\n",
      "\"And the majority of the issues he suffers from are very personal and intimate.\"\n",
      "But then she goes on to describe his extreme anger, how he was verbally and emotionally abusive.\n",
      "Then describing Porter getting more violent. Things aren't working, they get separated.\n",
      "She says he violated the terms of their separation, she files for a protective order against him.\n",
      "There was an instance where he punched through a glass door.\n",
      "In December of 2010, she says Porter assaulted her saying it happened. Just after our first anniversary\n",
      "I cannot remember what the fight was about but I excused myself from the fight in a way that was typical at that time I\n",
      "Certainly was not meek and mild and said I'm not going to fight you anymore and stormed off and went to take a shower he\n",
      "Was not done fighting with me. It was a glass shower door\n",
      "He opened it and dragged me by my shoulders out of the shower to yell immediately upon seeing my reaction to that he released me\n",
      "and apologized\n",
      "But it doesn't take away that he was angry enough that that\n",
      "Happened also Porter's first wife in this article is asked for comment\n",
      "She says it was verbally emotionally and physically abusive and that is why I left now following this we see senator Orrin Hatch\n",

      "I've known him for years both as a close friend and as a personal adviser\n",
      "He is kind and considerate towards all the country needs more honest principled people like Rob Porter\n",
      "Which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails\n",
      "And then the other story comes out remember\n",
      "I said that he had a first wife Hobie Holderness gave that small statement for the first article and then\n",
      "separately shared her story\n",
      "She says he was never physical with me while we were dating and now I see there were red flags left and right she talks\n",
      "about him being verbally abusive, emotionally\n",
      "abusive and saying after their marriage in\n",
      "2003 things escalated.\n",
      "The first incident was during their honeymoon when Porter allegedly kicked her because quotes weren't having sex when he wanted to have sex\n",

      "I didn't do anything and it continued and then Holderness describes an escalation in the violence\n",
      "Pushing, digging an elbow into her, then it escalated to choking her\n",
      "She says it was not hard enough for me to pass out\n",
      "but it was scary humiliating and dehumanizing.\n",
      "Holderness then describes an incident in Italy where Porter punched her in the face saying we were arguing and he punched me in the\n",
      "Face he left visible marks when he punched me and I have pictures of that\n",
      "I didn't go to the police because I was scared I was in Italy alone\n",
